Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Q2 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. Please note that today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results, with more details than usual by end market, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insight into one-time items and our guidance for the third quarter of 2021.
Starting with a quick overview of the second quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% sequentially and 41% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in industrial, automotive and personal electronics. On a sequential basis, Analog grew 6% and Embedded Processing grew 2%. On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 42% and Embedded grew 43%. Our Other segment grew 30% from the year-ago quarter.
Moving on, given the current environment, again this quarter, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by end market and comment on our lead times. First, the industrial market was up mid-teens sequentially and up about 40% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most sectors. The automotive market grew sequentially following a strong first quarter 2021 and more than doubled from a weak year-ago compare. Personal electronics was about even sequentially and up about 25% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across sectors and customers within personal electronics.
Next, communications equipment was up low-single digits sequentially and was down upper teens from the year ago. Enterprise systems grew upper teens sequentially and was about even from the year ago. Regarding lead times, the majority of our products continue to remain steady. However, the growing demand in the second quarter of 2021 again expanded our list of hot spots, which required extending some lead times.
As planned, we continue to add incremental capacity in 2021 and first half of 2022 with additional support from the startup of our third 300-millimeter wafer fab, RFAB2, that will come online in the second half of 2022.
As discussed during our Capital Management review in February, our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology delivers the benefits of lower cost and greater control of our supply chain, which really shows through in a market environment like this.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $4.6 billion, up 41% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion, or 67% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $816 million, up 5% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 19% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.6 billion in R&D. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $48 million in the second quarter and are related to the National Semiconductor acquisition. These acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021 and then go to zero.
Operating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter, or 48% of revenue. Operating profit was up 80% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.9 billion, or $2.05 per share, which included a $0.06 benefit that was not in our prior outlook, due to the signing of a royalty agreement.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $386 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.5 billion.
In the quarter, we paid $942 million in dividends and repurchased $146 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $3.9 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 56% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $7.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter.
Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were down $34 million from the prior quarter and days were 111, which are below desired levels. In the second quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire Micron's 300-millimeter fab in Lehi, Utah. This investment continues to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology and is part of our long-term capacity planning.
The Lehi fab will be our fourth 300-millimeter fab, joining DMOS6, RFAB1 and soon-to-be completed RFAB2 in our wafer fab manufacturing operations. We continue to believe that our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology will be of growing importance in owning and controlling our supply chain.
For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.40 billion to $4.76 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.87 to $2.13. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 14%.
In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

2021-07-21,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Vivek Arya of Bank of America.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. Rafael and Dave, when I look at the last few quarters, your reported sales have been significantly above your guided range. And I mean, like between 5% to 13% above your original outlook and that’s just making it very hard to distinguish right between how to read your guidance, because even now you’re guiding to a flattish outlook and what suppose to be seasonally stronger quarter.
Should we take that to be conservatism? Should we take that to be a peaking in the cycle? And how is that the demand is so strong? You’re increasing supply, but yet your sales outlook is flattish. I think it's a very confusing message and I would love your insights into how to interpret your guidance. Are we reading them in the right way?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Vivek, thanks. Thanks for the question. I think, first, I would say perhaps normal seasonal patterns may not be the best measure to look at things, in periods like this. Certainly, the last few quarters, we would all agree have been unusual period that we’ve gone through and as we continue to move through. So, and as you said, the last few quarters have been exceptionally strong. Second quarter was certainly strong, both sequentially and year-over-year.
So, if you look at our guidance, it would suggest that next quarter will again be a very strong quarter. So in, as you know, our guidance is the best estimate that we have at this time. So that's what we try to do and try to give you that insight. You have a follow on?
Vivek Arya
Yes. Thanks, Dave. So from what you said, I assume that you are, again, implying conservatism unless you suggest otherwise. My real question is, when I look at the share buyback activity, it's been very low in the last few quarters. And there are only a few reasons why that would be, right? One is the simplest reason that maybe the stock is perhaps not attractive at these valuations, or it could be that you're preparing for some M&A, or is it some large CapEx or some caution about macro?
And to -- trying to understand why is there such a material shift in terms of your return of free cash flow strategy, right? We understand the dividend part has been very strong, but the share buyback activity has been very low over the last almost a year now. So we just appreciate your views as to why you are not buying back your stock at the pace at which you have historically done so. Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
No, I’m happy to address that one, Vivek. So first, let me take you back to how we think about cash return. And it's very well you follow us for many years. And you've heard us talk about this human capital management, a year in and year out. And our objective when it comes to cash returning to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through dividends as well as buybacks.
Now that that has never meant and doesn't mean that every single quarter or even every single year where that return is going to be exactly 100%, right? If you look at our history, over 15-plus years, it has been actually above 100%. So that shows our commitment to that and that commitment has not changed. We are committed to returning all free cash flow to the owners of the company over time.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And the next caller will be Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had two as well. I guess, one, clarification, Dave. I think when you talked about automotive, you said up sequentially in the second quarter. Did I test that right? Did you not give a specific number of automotive?
Dave Pahl
That's correct. It was up low single digits, Toshi.
Toshiya Hari
Okay. Got it.
Dave Pahl
Do you have follow-on? Yes.
Toshiya Hari
Yes. So in terms of gross margins, I realize you guys don't run the business management business for gross margins. But clearly, you had a very, very strong quarter in Q2, and I know you don't guide gross margins going forward. But based on how you're thinking about utilization rates in your factories, given what you know about pricing in your business, both on the analogue side as well as the embedded side going forward? How are you thinking about gross margins and kind of the OpEx leverage going forward in your business? Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. No, so first, let me emphasize a point you made. We do not focus on gross margins in how we run the business, just like you said. Our focus is on free cash flow generation. In fact, free cash flow per share, and how we can grow that over the long-term, right, because we think ultimately, that is what drives value for the owners of the company. And you can do that at 67% margin, you can do it at a lower margin, or you can do at a higher margin depends on a number of factors.
So - and then to answer your specific question, as we have always guided, over the long-term, not only one quarter or even many one year, but over the long-term, 70% to 75% fall through is the right way to - generally speaking in the right way to look at to model the company as we go forward. So as you put whatever revenue expectation you have there and fall that through, what about that rate and you'll be in the ballpark.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Toshi. I will consider that two questions, if that's okay. And we'll move on to our next caller.
Operator
And the next caller is going to be Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So now you don't think about running the business to gross margins, but I'm going to ask a gross margin question anyways. And you were at 65.2. Obviously, you did very strongly with this quarter. But you said you had $0.06 of royalties that was unexpected. That should have been about 1.4 points of gross margins as I understand it, if I do the math, right?
And then I think you had something like $50 million in Austin cost last quarter that should have rolled off this quarter. That would have been another 100 basis points, give or take. So I'm actually wondering why gross margins were -- in fact, if I take out the royalties, they would have been up 60 basis points only with 100 basis points of cost that should have rolled off with a massive revenue increase, like what's going on with what happened with gross margins in the current quarter given all of that?
Rafael Lizardi
So, Stacy, I -- let me address one and then I have to ask your question. I don't quite understand part of your question, but …
Stacy Rasgon
Or maybe royalties, working gross margin, maybe they weren’t …
Rafael Lizardi
Exactly, That’s the part I did it. Okay. So you’re assuming royalty?
Stacy Rasgon
Okay.
Rafael Lizardi
Okay. So let me address that first. We talk about royalty. It used to be in revenue and gross margin. But that was years ago, I think, three or four years ago. We -- yes, we moved that to other income and expense. So that is in that line, other income expenses. So it has nothing to do with margins. It has been for three or four years or so since we -- and the reason we moved that is very de minimis, it's a relatively small amount. It averages about $100 million a year. Of course, in the big scheme of things, given our revenue level is a relatively small amount, and we expect that to be continue to be small going forward.
On the other part of your question. So last quarter, we had about a $50 million hit to our gross margins. That was because of the winter storm in Texas. We did talk about that during the call we mentioned and that was all in gross margin. So, yes, you can adjust that. You can -- you guys just, however, you wish for fourth quarter to get the gross margin without that impact, right? And that may make more sense when you look at the trends.
Stacy Rasgon
Yes.
Rafael Lizardi
Does that answer your question?
Stacy Rasgon
Yes, that’s very helpful. Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
I think you have a second one, right? You still have a follow-up, or? 
Stacy Rasgon
So my follow-up, yes, you're guiding revenues flat, and you're guiding EPS down slightly. So either gross margins are going down or OpEx is going up. Although, I mean, normally optics, I think seasonably into Q3 would be down a few points. I guess on those are you expecting any sort of different OpEx trends into Q3 as you would normally see like in the normal Q3 is there something else going on because normally it's down sequentially?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. And well -- so the reason that EPS is moving at the midpoint is the royalty that we just talked about, right? So you just take out that $0.06 from the EPS that we just delivered. You get to a more normalized EPS without that royalty, and then compare that to the next quarter. And you'll see that there's nothing unusual there. We --, obviously we only give revenue and EPS range. But if there was something unusual in between the lines, we would point it out and there's nothing unusual. Nothing's changing much between the other lines, right, yep. Okay. Thank you, Stacy. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And next we have John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Dave and Rafael, I just want to go back to the revenue guidance, sort of flat at the midpoint with down sequentially. I guess I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that your deficiencies kind of increased in the June quarter, you said your hotspots went up? It sounds like demand is still relatively strong. And yet there's a part of your guidance that could be down sequentially, which I'm having a hard time grasping. Dave, maybe you can talk about end markets. Are there any end markets that particularly look like they're cooling off sequentially into the calendar third quarter? Or why the down sequential? I think I have to go back to see, quite a bit of time to see you guys have a flat to down sequential Q3.
Dave Pahl
And John, when you say down sequentially, just to clarify, are you saying that part of our range would imply that it could be down and the other part would imply that it will be up.
John Pitzer
Yes.
Dave Pahl
That's what -- that’s just to clarify that part of the question. I got you. Yes. So yes, John, if there's something that's unusual going on within an end market or region or product area, we've always provided insight into that, to help, understand, an outlook or even something that's happened in a current quarter. I'll just say that there's nothing unusual like that, that we feel that we would need to explain what's going on. I think that, as I mentioned earlier to Vivek's question on the topic, seasonality probably isn't the best thing to be looking at as we've been moving through the last few quarters. And I would say what that range implies, the revenue still will be -- will still be strong. So you've a follow on?
John Pitzer
Yes, just as my follow on, on RFAB2, I'm just curious with the proposed purchase of Lehi, should we think about sort of the building going on as planned. The pilot line going on as planned, but capacity at RFAB2 kind of slowed or how do we think about kind of now your mix of capacity as Lehi comes in next year. And what that means for CapEx and the ramp of RFAB2?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. No, let me tell you about that. So first, let me step back remind everyone objective when it comes to CapEx is to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth. And specifically, extending our low cost manufacturing advantage, primarily 300-millimeter, right? So we’ve talked about that for a long time and it's a core part of our strides. One of our competitive advantage is having that manufacturing and technology advantage.
RFAB2 will be the third 300-millimeter factory. Lehi will be our fourth 300-millimeter factory. RFAB2 will become operational sometime in the middle of next year, that's when the shell will be completed and then we will be deploying equipment there. And then we're incurring CapEx because of that. So CapEx as I said at the last call, will be higher, both in absolute dollars and as percent of revenue because of that. And then on top of that, at Lehi right, which we didn't have last quarter when we had talked -- when we had the earnings call.
So now Lehi is going to be on top of that. That's a $900 million purchase price, which will run through CapEx, but then in addition to that factory, it's ready for production once we qualify it, but at relatively low volumes. We still have to add CapEx at factory to take it to the volumes that we want and that will happen over time. And think of that CapEx is probably going to be -- is probably going to run about half of what RFAB2 CapEx will run. And I'm talking over years, right, as we deploy equipment there. And both of those will add to the strength or will strengthen our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology with two more 300-millimeter factories.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, John. And we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
And that will be Blayne Curtis of Barclays.
Blayne Curtis
Hey, thanks for taking the question. Actually I just want to ask on, I know you're not going to probably guide December, but just kind of any feel you can for that quarter. Obviously, seasonality has been out the window typically a down quarter. Just trying to get a better handle on the back half year obviously the flattening market, but at much higher levels. Anything you can throw out there for December?
Dave Pahl
Yes, Blayne. And certainly, I know there's lots of speculations on how long the strong demand will last and certainly we've read the ranges that it's going to end soon and others that say it is going to continue for quite some time. And obviously as you stated, we are not going to forecast the fourth quarter or even comment on how long the cycle last, because honestly as you know, we don't know, I don't think anyone knows. But I think we can frame how the actions that we've taken and our approach as we've gone through the cycle.
And in the first phase, you've seen us accelerate into the widely anticipated decline and that really enabled us to gain ground. And really, in the second phase, we're working to ensure that we gain strategic ground, particularly in industrial and automotive and that -- those gains will reward us for years to come. And independent of that, we are investing for the long-term. So some of the obvious things that you can see are the new manufacturing investments in RFAB2.
If you're down here in Texas, you will see cranes up over the building. I think I counted six or seven at the max that were up over that. The additional Lehi, some of the less visible ones are the R&D investments and new capabilities at ti.com and those investments are continuing. So we won't -- we will go through cycles. We won't be able to predict it, but we can make the place stronger. We can continue to invest in our competitive advantages. So do you have follow-on?
Blayne Curtis
Thanks. Yes, I just wanted to ask you on inventory levels. Obviously, way down at these sales levels on a days inventory, but your ability to grow that absolute amount and if you're able to do that in the September?
Rafael Lizardi
I will start and Dave, you want to follow-up. But inventory levels, first, let me remind everyone the objective there, maintain high levels of customer satisfaction while minimizing obsolescence which frankly is not an issue given our business model. We are clearly below desired levels, just like we said during the prepared remarks, right. We are running about 111 days and our target is 130 to 190 days. That's part of the reason why we have the hotspots that we talked about.
At the same time I will tell you, we go back to second quarter last year when the pandemic was starting, in fact, March of last year, everybody, all our competitors were decreasing their inventory levels, slowing down factories. We went the other way right. We maintained and in fact increased our production levels. We increased our inventory levels. They went from about 140 days to 160, some 170 days, almost. And that along with our business strategy, our business model helped to put us in a great position to take advantage of the situation and has helped us do significantly better than our competitors over the last three or four quarters, right.
But we have gotten to a point where, yes, things are -- inventory is now below desired levels. We will continue to add incremental capacity as we have talked about, that is in all of our factories, especially RFAB1, but the next bigger tranche of capacity will come in with RFAB2 as we talked about earlier. Once that is operational sometime in the second quarter or next year, then that will -- that’s when we finish and when we produce revenues sometime in the second half of next year, then that will add a significant amount of capacity and then shortly after that, Lehi will also come in line for additional revenue capacity there.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And maybe just quickly, what I might add to that, obviously, whenever things do slow, we will then use that period of time to rebuild inventories in those positions to be able to support growth in the future, so.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. And I will just add one more thing. Both RFAB2 and Lehi, those are long-term play, right? These are -- this is to strengthen our manufacturing advantage, owning our own manufacturing, which clearly has proven over the last year and a half, we knew that already but it has proven that how important that is in the current environment. They are going to happen to help in the medium term, most likely, but if they don't, if things slow down and it doesn't work out that way that is completely fine with us. That's not why we are equipping those factor, that's not why we bought -- we're buying Lehi is for the long-term positioning of the company to support long-term revenue growth in both Analog and Embedded.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Blayne. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
And next we will go to Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thank you very much, Rafael and Dave. I had a question on free cash flow per share. And you guys know I don't look at it on a quarterly basis. So if I look at the last 2 years, if I look at 2020 free cash flow per share, down 3%. 2019 it was flat. And I know that if I look at this year on a trailing 12-month basis, it is up double-digit, but it has lagged -- sorry for the background noise it always happens when I’m on a conference call. If I look at the trailing 12 months and then -- so that's in line with what you have said consistently. But should we expect this to come back to the double-digit on an annualized basis. What's the right way to think about the lag over the last 2 years and how should we think about it going forward?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, this is one -- most financial metrics are this way too, but if you want to look at this over the long-term, right, any one quarter or even any one year, they could be a little choppy. You mentioned a couple of years when 2019 and even 2020 where that trajectory does not represent the longer term. And arguably the same thing for 2021 or the trailing 12 months number that you just quoted, right. So if you want to look at this over the long-term, and that's how we look at it, and that's what's going to ultimately drive value for the owners of the company, right.
Ambrish Srivastava
Okay. That’s fair.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes, I did. With all the tightness and contrast this with the way you guys have managed the business, and the share shift probably show up that quickly because these designs are such long lasting and they don't change on a dime. Are you seeing any discernible change in your design in activity as a result of what we've seen from your peers with the tightness and you managing your lead times and inventory much better than some of your peers? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Yes, I will start off and Rafael if you want to add. I would say that as you know, Ambrish, we have started on the journey to have closer direct relationships with customers really 8 -- 7, 8 years ago with our investments on ti.com, investments in our sales, applications teams, investments in processes and how we do business and just our structure inside of the company. And last year, you saw a pretty major step of taking more customers direct and operating with fewer distributors as well as transacting business through ti.com.
So you kind of mix that together with the pandemic c and our ability to do virtual sales calls. I think all those things have positioned us well strategically, especially in markets like industrial, automotive, those markets where we want to gain that strategic ground. You couple that with availability and like you say things don't move quickly, but the supply shortages really started showing up in the beginning of 2020 took a break in the first or second quarter, when the pandemic hit and then reaccelerated after that.
So there are cases that are unusual, but there are cases where customers redesign boards just because of availability. I will describe that as an outlier. But we do see cases of that, but we see more cases where you have designs that are being intersected as they come through. And again, our sales teams are engaged from production all the way back into engineering and that gives that visibility is a great strategic advantage and those benefits again will be things that will pay rewards for us for a long time to come. Okay. Thank you, Ambrish. And I think we've got time for one last caller.
Operator
And that caller will be Chris Danely of Citigroup.
Christopher Danely
Thanks guys. Hey, Dave, by the way thanks for the other analysts go first and beat you up on the flat guidance. So I don't have to. My question is on the auto revenue. So if we look at the headlines and talk to the folks in the auto supply chain, there's still a lot of shortages etcetera, etcetera out there. And I think your revenue was only slightly up. So can you just explain the discrepancy? It seems like it would be up a little bit more than that if there's all these folks clamoring for parts out there?
Dave Pahl
Well, I would point out it over doubled from a year-ago, Chris. So it's a little bit more than up a little bit and I think you're pointing to the sequential. But again, last quarter it was up over 25% from pre-pandemic levels. I don't think we are shipping 25% more cars from pre-pandemic levels, right. So our shipments into automotive are up and up significantly, and we continue to add capacity and continue to -- we believe we are gaining share there as well. You got to measure it over time. But, yes, so we are -- our shipments are up there and up strong. So you have a follow-on?
Christopher Danely
Yes. Just, I guess the hotspot question. So you said that you're seeing a few more hotspots last quarter. Do you think that the situation gets a little bit worse this quarter or do you think it gets better? When do you guys think you'll start to get a handle on all these sort of supply issues out there I guess?
Rafael Lizardi
Chris, it's going to depend on demand, right. We are on the supply side, as we said, we are adding capacity incrementally. We have been and we will continue to do that. The bigger tranche of capacity doesn't come in until about a year from now right as we just talked about, RFAB2 and then 6 months later we've Lehi. So it will be a while before we’ve big tranches of capacity coming online. So it's going to depend on demand.
At the end of the day, we don't fully control there. It is more of a macro situation, but we are better prepared than our peers and have been in both the tactical decisions we have made during the pandemic, but more importantly, our business model and how we run the company, specifically own in our own manufacturing that there has been a key in this whole process and we are just really doubling down on that. We’ve -- what we were doing with all those factories that we just talked about.
Dave Pahl
Thank you, Chris. Rafael do you want up first?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I will go ahead and wrap up. So let me just emphasize what we have said previously. At our core, we are engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.
While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When where successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening.

Stacy Rasgon
Good morning, everyone. I’m Stacy Rasgon, I’m Bernstein Senior Analyst, covering U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment. And I can’t express what an honor it is to have our guest here today, Rich Templeton, the Chairman, President and CEO of Texas Instruments.
Before we begin, I want to mention that you have questions you would like to ask during the presentation, which we’ll ask last about 50 minutes today. You can submit them through our pigeonhole forum. There should be a link on screen there. We will have time for audience Q&A at the end. So Rich, comes here every year and every year I go on and on about TI sort of what’s been a remarkable multi-year transition story and how it’s benefited from them. And they kind of made it look easy over the years, but in fact, they – Rich often says that he likes to see – he likes people to see them as boring.
In reality, it was almost certainly not easy. And when you dig in, in my opinion, it’s anything but boring. TI was one of the first companies who recognize the futility of competing in wireless. Some of those exits painful time freed up significant investments to grow in the much more attractive businesses that made it the bulk of the portfolio today. The 300 millimeter manufacturing strategy it seems old hat now, but it was looked at as crazy when they started it, but it’s resulted in significantly lower CapEx levels, substantially higher free cash flow generation and margins and they’re doubling down on that 300 millimeter strategy today.
Gross margins have been on an upward trajectory for years as the benefits of these strategies have rolled through. And more recently, they’ve been leveraging inventory and capacity strategically in ways their competitors just simply can’t. And of course, TI was one of the first, if not the first of their peers through both words and actions to commit to return a 100% of free cash flow, which is at a higher level today, which of course has become a very attractive story for many investors.
To give us some color on these and many other topics, it’s my great pleasure to welcome, Rich. Rich, thank you so much for being with us today.
Rich Templeton
Stacy, thanks for having me today. It’s always a pleasure.
Stacy Rasgon
Yes, likewise, likewise. Rich, generally like to try to stay away from near-term questions to this format, given this the situation in the industry around shortages and everything else. I think I am going to have to start out with some of those. And certainly, I’ve been doing this job more than a dozen years. I’ve never seen anything quite like this. You’ve been doing this job a lot longer than I have. I’d be curious. Just number one, have you ever seen anything similar to this? Maybe the financial crisis might be the thing that comes close, but I mean are we in sort of an unprecedented kind of shortage in constraint environment? Have you seen anything like this before?
Rich Templeton
Yes. Stacy, I think the analogy to the financial crisis is at least the most recent significant transition that we’ve looked at. But for those of us that were also managing through the Y2K ramp, where you had a strong PC world that then got overheated with Y2K builds. It does have a little of that froth in it as well just in terms of some of the energy that’s around. So I’ve seen these and we’ve gone through them. The comments that I make internally and it’s going to go up and then after it goes up, it’s going to go down and after it goes down, it’ll go up again, and I don’t try to dismiss it. But we really just try to look through it at what the long-term growth trends are and that’s tended to serve us pretty well.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. It seems to me that you’re one of the few players that sort of took a lesson from the financial crisis. So in the financial crisis, I was there as well. You kind of got caught along with everybody else in that scenario. I remember you’d kind of pulled back your lead times stretched out to very lengthy timeframes. And it seems like this time you’ve decided that wasn’t going to happen again. I think even said it like the lost opportunity from not being able to serve demand, obviously what’s the impact of holding too much inventory.
And at this point, like, you’ve actually decided to build inventory through this whole cycle. I think even said it like last year, you want to be prepared for demand in case of that snapback, which has certainly happened. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that decision, keep the fabs running mostly full continuing to build channel inventory, and maybe just sort of like take us back to the financial crisis, maybe some compare and contrast of the current situation versus what we saw today.
Rich Templeton
Yes. I think your summary is a pretty good one in terms of what we experienced back 10 odd years ago and how we’ve approached it, but we’re also a very different profile company versus 10 years ago. When you’re running with a big wireless business and most of those devices, they may not be custom, but they’re pretty close to custom. And you’ve got to be very careful about what you build inventory wise. So move ahead to what we’re living through today by design the portfolio looks and feels very different. We talk as one of the competitive advantages of diversity and longevity. And that just lets us make very – to me, logical decisions like the one we announced on the earnings call in April a year ago, when we said we were going to keep the factory run – the factories running, because it just made sense.
You also watched us to your I think point made that when Rafael and Dave gave the capital management update I think it’s late January, early February. We’ve raised the high end of our inventory range, because when you just think about the products that we build and the longevity that they are, it just it’s at a great advantage that we have. And so I think that we’ve handled this cycle much better than the one 10 years ago, and better than our competitors. And we’ve got some really interesting things that, we intend to be better even the next cycle, because there will be another one we don’t know when it is, but these are just it’s a great way to always be getting better.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Got it. And I guess, I don’t really want to ask this. Let’s talk about I guess the demand profile. I mean you’ve talked about taking the inventory target up. You actually haven’t really been able to take your days of inventory on your balance sheet up, I guess as a function of how strong the demand actually is. Are you parsing I guess those order levels in that demand at all? Are you kind of trying to judge what your customer’s ordering versus what they need? Are you just if you – or is it the case where if you can fulfill the order that you’re fulfilling it. But I don’t know if you’d be able to tell the difference one way or the other in terms of what your customers are doing. Are you just – are you shipping the demand right now just as the orders come in?
Rich Templeton
Stacy, we’ve talked many times. Dave has made this comment many times on the earnings call. Everybody says they have great channel visibility until all of a sudden they declare they don’t. And so you do your best job keeping up with customers and you said it very accurately. We would love to have our inventory levels higher. But demand is just so strong right now. And we’re now a year plus into that. And we will get a window will open up, we’ll get an opportunity to get that inventory rebuilt and we’ll get that done at that time.
But it’s also why, and I think Rafael or Dave talked on the earnings call. I’m not interested in going out and booking multiple years of inventory of backlog, because customers don’t know what they need. And if you can tell them it’s non-cancelable, but them ordering stuff they don’t need is not that helpful. So we really just try to keep a steady hand on this, ship as best we can, keeping up with things. We’ve got a couple of hotspots we’re still working. And as soon as things lead up, we’ll hopefully get some inventory build.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Do you think like this trend of non-cancelable orders, do you think that eventually drives the eventual oscillation worse? If to your point their ordering stuff that they don’t need, I mean, does that make the eventual like the cycle worse?
Rich Templeton
I have no – my guess is no. Because that stuff will get processed through. And to me that’s probably more noise on the edge than it is overall volume, because it’s certainly not how we’re operating. I don’t think it’s going to make a big difference as my guess, but it certainly not our approach.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Got it. Maybe on the good side of this, do you think you’re taking share to your – due to your inventory and capacity strategy? So I know in general share tends to be sticky. It’s not that easy to swap one part out for it, but to your point, we – this has been going on for what a year longer. Is that enough time for customers to actually start designing? And are you actually seeing any of that kind of activity?
Rich Templeton
Well, the fact is I think that you really started seeing the shortages when things kind of snapped in March of 2020, particularly if you were staying very close to what was happening in China, because they really went through that cycle beginning in January. And so customers have had more than enough time to redesign portions of boards based on lack of supply. And I think if you look at our general revenue trends over the past year, they’ve held up I think pretty well compared to most of the competitors that you would probably monitor us against or judged against even WSDS number. We still always believe that you better judge, share gains over the long-term. I think they get talked about way too tactically, but my guess those moves have served us pretty well for the past year.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Got it. Let’s talk a little bit about the – I guess the distribution strategy, because that’s the other kind of like side of this. And obviously this is to the extent that I get people asking about their case on TI, this is one of them, you guys have disintermediated your channel and that’s going to come back to bite you in some sense. At the same time though, like it’s not anything new, you guys have been sort of moving along a very kind of concrete distribution strategy for going on 10 years and it’s been evolving over the time. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you’ve done in your channel over that 10-year period? Maybe from where we were in 2008 or 2009, the financial crisis to where we are today, what’s changing, how’s it benefiting you?
Rich Templeton
Yes. Stacy, we’ve talked again on this for quite a long time and it’s just been, as we’ve looked at our competitive advantages and manufacturing and technology breadth of our product line, reach of our channel and then diversity and longevity reach of our channel is just extraordinarily unique thing that we have. And we can do it because of the breadth of the product portfolio. So we’ve built up our own sales and applications team that’s larger than everybody, so we can get to everyone.
We moved most of the design creation or design when work, it’s probably five plus years ago over. Everybody said, they’re not going to – they are going to lose share, and you’ve watched us now just continue to march higher. And then during really 2020, we completed the last phase of that to where we moved significant amount of the revenue direct and narrow down our distribution customer – distribution base just because we weren’t going to be moving as much revenue through that channel.
And again, this one goes back to as we talk internally luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. And that turned out to be a pretty lucky move for 2020 when things are tight, customers want very close relationships. And having distribution or people buffering between you and them only puts noise in it, and we’ve really been rewarded with those moves during the past year I think. And I just think they’re going to continue to serve as well. At the higher level, just go outside of our industry, nothing good happens when you’ve got buffers between you and your eventual customers.
So we intend to have close relationships. We’re going to get better insight, better knowledge. It’s going to let us service the tactical production demand better. But it’s also going to give us insight into what the business is, where aren’t we, where do we have to win more and how do we grow our business even faster. So I’m really thrilled at the timing that we were able to get that last phase done in 2020 and right in the middle of the pandemic and it’s really paid off for us.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. How much of the businesses direct today versus going through the channel?
Rich Templeton
We gave the update, I think closing the year that I think we averaged, I forget Stacy was in the mid-40s, 45, 46, 47, but we left the year, I think month of December, just approaching 60 and we’ll get an update to everybody as we wrap up 2021 in January.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. And it’s – you talk a lot about ti.com as a competitive differentiator to go to, how much of the business, how much of the revenue today goes through ti.com?
Rich Templeton
Yes. It’s just – it’s one of these great rapidly growing portions of the business. And one, we continue to add more capability and those were investments that we’ve been making now really for five years and we continue to get better and better in terms of how we can reach locally, be the importer of record, just make it easy to transact business. And it certainly helps over the past year when you have product availability that tends to make you a popular supplier as well. And so that’s been a really a great combination over time. So that’s why I go back to a lot of investments, a lot of work that’s been underway, and we’ve really been fortunate to see it come together at a very lucky time in terms of what the pandemic has done, how it’s stressed the system, but how we’ve been able to perform.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. But how much is actually going through that ti.com channel. I mean if you’re like close to 60% of the revenue exited in the year was direct, how much of that’s actually going through the website?
Rich Templeton
Yes. We’ve not released the number on that. We’ll figure out when we want to put some numbers on it, but it is rapidly growing, very pleased with what it looks like.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Got it. Growth in general like I’ve had this theory on analog space in general, that the growth just has to be a more important part of the recipe going forward. I mean you guys have – it’s the transformation again over the last 10 years plus has been phenomenal. I remember when I first started this job, you had aspirational targets to get to 55% gross margins and 30% operating margin. Obviously you’ve gone through all of those.
If I look forward for where we are today, there just given like you have the improvement that we’ve seen in the model. I mean there’s some and we can talk about how much have you might be left, but I mean you’re probably not going to get another 1,500 basis points of margin expansion going forward, probably. So to me that means growth needs to be a more important piece of the recipe going forward. Would you agree with that sentiment?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I think the sentiment is accurate. The only reason that you’ll hear me give a careful answer, you’ll hear Rafael give a careful.
Stacy Rasgon
You guys never sign up for a growth target, which I think and probably go ahead.
Rich Templeton
And the reason – Stacy, the reason behind that is just look at all the other companies where revenue growth becomes a singular objective. And if – and we just have a very strong belief that you’ve got to get stronger and aim at the right markets and revenue growth as a result, not something you chase by itself. But your – to the math, your math is I think very accurate to grow free cash flow per share over the next 10 years. It has to be predominantly driven by top line growth. And that’s about the analog business. And it’s about the embedded business both contributing.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Let’s talk about those two businesses, and they’ve had different profiles recently, which we’ll get into. But let’s talk about analog, obviously auto and industrial, analog and embedded, these are the areas that you guys have, but where is TI’s competitive differentiation analog, obviously you are the biggest player, although we’ve got some folks both I guess organically and inorganically are trying to build up on the scale front. Where is TI’s competitive advantage in analog? And does it go beyond the things that you’ve talked about? I know you’ve talked about manufacturing capacity. You’ve talked about the inventory. Is there anything like specialist specific to analog though the TI does better than everybody else?
Rich Templeton
Yes. So I know it’s a – it goes back probably to the boring comment when I just study this thing and I know people say, yes, it’s got to be more exciting. Well, take the four advantages, manufacturing and technology. If all you get out of manufacturing and technology is lower costs and better control of your supply chain, okay. That’s a pretty good advantage, okay, for you to carry. And even with other companies that are trying to get bigger, you don’t have anybody doing what we’re doing in terms of 300 millimeter.
And in terms of what we do internally on assembly, for example, then you move up to the channel discussions that I just had. And you think about an industrial and an automotive base. You’ve got to get literally to tens of thousands of customers. You’ve got to get to them efficiently. You’ve got to do a great technical job and a great production job. And you’ve got to make the investments to be able to do that better than anybody.
So when you start looking at what really is a sustainable competitive advantage, meaning you get tangible benefits plus it’s difficult to copy, okay. I think those are going to things that really separate us in the long-term. Do you have to have great designers and do great parts and have low power or high speed or low noise, all the technical attributes, depending on the product category, the answer is yes. You got to have those. But the things that you really want is what can really set you apart from your competitors that is just very difficult for them to copy. And I think we got those well-understood and we invest with those in mind.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Why is the embedded business been so much different than analog in terms of the growth profile over the last a bit of time? Like what – why happened…
Rich Templeton
Okay. Go ahead.
Stacy Rasgon
I was just like why haven’t we seen the same level of performance in that business as we’ve seen an analog.
Rich Templeton
Yes. I look at that one Stacy, and we’re very clear when we have something that isn’t performing well, we accept it and we get to work on it. And you watched embedded really top out back. And it was probably late 2018. And I think we’ve been very direct that we were extraordinarily focused portfolio wise on that. We had a new leader that we brought in. And we said, hey, look, our goal is to turn that into a long-term grower that can grow just like analog.
We’re not looking for short-term sockets that will kick up a quarter and make somebody feel better. And I think during 2020, and really even in the first quarter of 2021, you’ve started to see kind of Phase 1, which is get stability and get that business starting to improve. And now we’ve just got to go prove over the next couple of years that we can grow at the same way. I’ve got great confidence, the portfolio, the products, the management, the – I’ve got the advantage of I hear the salespeople firsthand and the customers excited about what’s going on. And that’s always the right leading indicator of having confidence of where it’s going to go.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. What are some of the changes that you’re making? Is it investing in new types of products? Or is it changing like how you’re reaching out to the customers? Or like what was the issue there that’s being changed? And I know there was an exit there was, well, I know some of it was the comm infrastructure exit, so that was some of it there.
Rich Templeton
Just you have heard us be very careful. There’s no doubt that comm infrastructure is part of that decline, but that is not the dominant part of it. And so you haven’t heard us use that as an excuse. It’s really about picking the areas of the products that we were in and really focusing on the ones that take you to the broader markets, the broader applications and the better growth opportunities. And that’s really what I think that that team has done and get it reoriented. The general product categories are identical. And we just had some areas that we thought we needed to heavy up. Some that we thought we could invest less and then really move the emphasis and get people more aggressive. So we’ll continue to – we’ve just got to keep showing that we can drive results on that.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Got it. A lot of times people also they look at the margins of that business and they compare them to the analog and obviously lower. Is that just a matter of the revenue scale? Like if embedded was as big as analog, would it have similar margins?
Rich Templeton
No, it’s not going to be identical, but I laugh a little bit that where, how many of the top semiconductor companies let alone the S&P 500 would love to have embedded profitability. And so I find that an academic discussion as opposed to, it’s a great business that can grow, and I don’t need it to have identical margins to analog. I just need it to grow nicely and be a great contributor to the company long-term, which I think it can be.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Got it. But I mean it is true that is revenues grow the margin should go up, correct?
Rich Templeton
Yes. You will get some scale, just in terms of R&D leverage on that. But there’s also no doubt that analog is a pretty unique capability in terms of the margins that it operates at as well.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Let’s talk a little bit about your R&D strategy. So like this is another thing that you’re one of the few companies that, that I’ve heard people say they should spend more money, not less. And it is true as a percentage of revenue like on R&D you guys tend to spend less than your competitors, although on an absolute basis just given your scale, you spend a lot more. Could you talk a little bit about just like your overall R&D strategy, how do you actually look at, how do you make investments in sizing those investments and how do you give investors confidence that you’re spending the right amount of money on R&D?
Rich Templeton
Yes. To me, the best working that question backwards, the best way to talk to investors about confidence is what’s the track record been in terms of investments and translating that into growth, could we go justify spending a higher percentage of revenue and defend it that other companies are doing that, sure. Data is there, as you said, but if we’re growing faster than that’s kind of a silly comparison to go make. So our orientation really goes back to the comment I made on the revenue side a few minutes back, which is we want to get stronger aim at the right markets and that results in bigger.
And so that’s how you see as guiding where dollars go, what gets heavy to up, what’s – what gets invested in, and we continue to grow the absolute dollar value of R&D and we’ll continue to do that going forward. And the markets could go up and down and you’ll see us with a pretty steady hand, because those R&D decisions are five and 10-year decisions that, that you’ve got to make. So I’ve been pleased with that discipline, and I think the results reflect that discipline.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. And I guess for those share gains, I mean you have still continued to gain share on analog. I mean it’s been I don’t know what it is half a point, a year point a year whatever it is, but it’s going to…
Rich Templeton
Its – we have probably run the 30 basis points to 40 basis points over the past eight, nine years. And I usually try to benchmark post the national integration and 2012 just to have clean numbers going forward. The past couple of years have probably been a little higher than that. And now we just have to keep working try to keep pushing that number up.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Let’s talk a little bit about, I guess, the business mix itself. So obviously, like you guys are very strong in terms of pushing on industrial and auto was the most attractive markets we plan. Can you talk a little bit about what makes those attractive, whether it’s content or sustainability barriers to entry, terminal value of the portfolio, TI’s like secret sauce in those markets? Like, what is that brings you to them and how do you see that differentiating versus where your competitors are. Because everybody’s going into those markets, right, everybody now sees them as attractive.
Rich Templeton
Right. Well, as you know, we made those statements six, seven, eight years ago and said, those are the markets that we want to have strategic emphasis, not the only thing that we do, but we certainly want to be strategically heavy in those. And the reason is I just thought it was an absolute no brainer that they were going to be the highest growing markets over the long-term. And the secret behind that is semiconductor content growth persistent. And so if you just go through automotive applications or go through industrial applications, and if you want to make that piece of equipment use less energy or be more serviceable or safer or smaller or more portable, what are you going to do to that system? You’ve got to put semiconductors inside of it, because most of those markets are electromechanical or mechanical based markets.
So we just looked at that and we said, that is a great, probably 20-year and maybe longer secular trend of rising semiconductor content that will really be a great opportunity. And those are applications when you – if you look at our product portfolio, it’s not an accident what we invest in. It’s about low power microcontrollers and it’s about sensors, and it’s about the ability to detect or drive motors, the ability to power or everything. You could just literally walk around a block diagram of a board and that will explain the product portfolio that we have to match to it.
So that’s why we’ve been heavy up in it. We’ve done well from industrial market share and an automotive market share, I think over those seven or eight years as you said, everybody says, they want to get into it. That’s easy to put on a PowerPoint slide, but when you really start breaking down, what IPD you need, what process technology do you need, what reach of channels do you need? Take a look at the importance of manufacturing and technology to those customers. You have to have all those capabilities to go really service that market well and we’re not – so we’re not there by accident. It was a very conscious plan that’s led us here.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Let’s dive in a little bit to the auto business section since we’re on the topic. So this business was growing for you guys, it was probably double-digits, at least pre-COVID. And I guess, we’ll see what it’s doing now in the wake of some of the supply chain issues. Can you talk a little bit though about what was driving that growth? And I know your auto portfolio is very, very diversified, like, but there were – were there specific areas in it that were driving growth, was it broad-based. And I guess, do you have a perspective on how much of your auto portfolio might be, I don’t know, if you want to – might want to call it like SAR dependent versus like more secular or like more content dependent.
Rich Templeton
Yes. So I think there’s, Stacy, a few things inside of that. First is kind of similar to the discussion, I just had of the – why we love industrial and automotive. In automotive, we really take that on with the same level of detail granularity. So we’re not interested in a couple of sockets and a couple of revenue areas, because while that can be fun on the upside usually those things have a short life to the downside. And we really organize the team to go across, okay, all the major markets.
So think the – everything from body and chassis to lighting, to infotainment, to safety and ADAS and to electrification or power train. And usually everybody talks, power train or EV, everybody talks ADAS and we love those and we’re doing very well in those, but we also see many opportunities across the rest of the vehicles as well. So our teams are set up that way. We’ve got system teams that break down all those subsystems to go make sure we’re maximizing our design wins in them. And we also make sure that we’re maximizing our penetration throughout the world. So that we don’t have any single point dependencies, because our data says that’s what really drives sustainable long-term growth when you do that. So that’s been the conscious plan and it has worked really quite well for us.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it, got it. I guess not to go back to the short-term, but I mean, you have obviously automotive has been impacted most given some of the vagaries of the supply chain and some of the behaviors of the customers, like in the middle of COVID. Do you have a point of view at least within auto about how long those shortages might continue to last? From your perspective, like, I don’t know, you can’t speak to the rest of it.
Rich Templeton
I don’t try to handicap that, Stacy. We just keep up with people. We talked on both the – I think the January earnings call and the April call that our revenue into automotive was up 25%, okay, versus pre-COVID. I think we used fourth quarter 2019 to have kind of a clean compare on that. So we’re just going to keep up with they say, they need right now. And we’ll figure out how that trends over time.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Let’s talk about some of the areas of the portfolio that are not auto and industrial. So comm infrastructure is an interesting one. 5G obviously is a big buzzword and people are very excited about it. And you guys seem to be on the other end of the spectrum sometimes when it comes to 5G to comm infrastructure in general in 5G opportunities in particular. Can you maybe just give us a little more of your own point of view on comm infrastructure as a market and the 5G opportunity in particular as you guys see it?
Rich Templeton
Yes. The way I would describe it, Stacy is we’re just careful with buzzwords, because they tend to come and go. And it’s hard to turn those into cash, okay. They’re fun to talk about, we made the comments or we made the decision and I forget 2014 somewhere back six, seven years ago that we just looked at what the infrastructure marketer to comm infrastructure market would look like, if CapEx isn’t going to grow by the carriers, it’s hard for the semiconductor market to grow. And when we looked at it and broke it down into a more detailed level, we said, look, most of our business at that time was on the digital side of things baseband and some of those pieces, we said that’s clearly going to come down. We deemphasize that that has written down as we just talked about with embedded.
But we also said, when you look at more sophisticated radios and antennas that go along with a 5G world going forward, that’s a great analog opportunity. And so if you actually look at the revenue, we’ve been doing very well with analog revenue into the comm infrastructure market as embedded as wound down. And we think it’ll continue to be one of the good opportunities, but not the opportunity. And so it really just comes back to, we really want strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive, but we are going to participate in comm infrastructure, we’re going to participate in personal electronics, in infrastructure or enterprise, those are good markets. They need our products, they like our products. So we’ll do those as well as the emphasis on industrial and automotive.
Stacy Rasgon
So maybe to talk about personal electronics then, like, so what is attractive about this? But this is what 30%, 35% of your revenue, it’s not small. What’s in your – I guess, this is PCs and smartphones and tablets and other stuff. What is it about this market that’s attractive?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I think the number is more in the mid-20s.
Stacy Rasgon
Maybe it’s small, okay.
Rich Templeton
Personal electronics, and that was, we’ve been able to kind of hold our own in that, but industrial and automotive growth have just led to that being a smaller percent. The reason, we use the word personal electronics is the things we put in there, PCs, cell phones, gaming, TVs, that type of product that tends to be more of a 12-month, 18-month product cycle type of purchase. It has just the time constant that different than industrial and automotive.
So we think it’s more insightful to put those together. And certainly those are going to be big markets for a long time, but I don’t think you’re going to see the same growth way in overall personal electronics that you will see in industrial and automotive, because the number of people on the planet just isn’t growing by that greater degree. And so there’s – I don’t know, 2.5 billion personal electronic devices to ship annually, that number has actually been pretty flat. Probably since 2013, 2014, dollar contents, probably going up a little bit. So it’s going to be a good market. They love our parts. We’ve got some very important parts that those markets like, and it’s going to be an important part of TI for a long time.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. And I guess, to swing back to industrial then in that context, how do we think about content increase within industrial? I know maybe it’s harder, like, automotive is a single end market. You can kind of like, you have, I remember what it is 15 different sub-segments in industrial and it’s hundreds of end markets really, and thousands of products and tens of thousands of customers. Is there some sort of a framework for how to think about content increase or like, how do you guys think about that?
Rich Templeton
Yes. My guess Stacy is, it’s very difficult to analyze. And that wasn’t on purpose.
Stacy Rasgon
I found it’s a…
Rich Templeton
But it is difficult to analyze, but just think about the question on the benefit that comes with something that’s difficult to analyze. You’ve got to go get to thousands of end equipments, tens of thousands of customers, thousands of parts, okay. And do things very well. And when you do that, it’s actually very difficult to be attacked, okay, in any one place for any substantive gains. So we love the competitive dynamics that go along with that type of market. And it will be. I think it’s going to be very difficult to analyze, because in order to analyze something, you’ve got to get down to the specific end equipment. And there’s just no one piece of end equipment that makes up a substantive portion, which we think is great, in terms of what’s going to drive long sustainable diverse growth.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Yes. So we’ve talked a lot here about some of the organic opportunities. I’d like to switch to some of the inorganic activity in the space. And analog has been an area of consolidation, not so much for you guys, at least not for awhile. You mentioned that semi in 2012, there’s been some other deals in the space more recently. But I guess, what are your general views on M&A and TI’s like specific views on what it would take, because again, you guys have not been broad participants in that activity over the last decade or so.
Rich Templeton
Yes. We’re pretty unchanged from the post Memorial Day discussion that we’ve had for a number of years together on this. That is that – it would have to be something that strategically made sense. So it would have to be catalog oriented, it would have to be a bias to industrial and automotive for all the reasons that we’ve covered in this talk. And then the numbers have to make sense. And you just haven’t seeing it makes sense for a number of years and you look at the investments that we can make the rates of return that we can achieve on those, I just think that discipline is really important.
So and the good news with what we’ve built and what we’ve assembled, we don’t have any well strategic requirement or strategic synergy or whatever the term is that the bankers invent that justifies overpaying for something. So I love being in the position that we are on that. Because, in the end, you’ve got to grow these things organically to generate value long-term, just putting things together, does not create value, okay. It just creates noise and fees, okay. The real judge of success is what do you do with it after you put it together.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. I guess to that end, like, on the organic front, like in terms of the operating model and where you can drive it like yourself with growth or whatever. To be fair, if I look at it, gross margins are higher than they’ve – maybe not as high as they’ve ever been like, but pretty close. Your OpEx model I think is 20% to 30% of revenue and so you’re kind of bumping up on the lower end of that. Is there anything left in the operating model from here? And I want to talk about 300 millimeter and maybe there’s some driver there. But I mean, how do we think about the evolution of the margin model? Not just from the growth opportunity, we’re hopefully you get some leverage there, but just from structurally within the business itself, is there any more room left on the operating model, given the – frankly, given the degree of improvement that we’ve had over the last, like 10 plus years?
Rich Templeton
Yes. Stacy, go back to the discussion we had on revenue growth to meet easiest way to communicate it is, assume that the majority of the growth of free cash flow per share over time has got to come from top line growth. That doesn’t mean there isn’t any room left, could there be some incremental room at the free cash flow margin line or depending on valuation in the stock market on share count reduction. Those are all things that we’ve got the ability and the discipline to go manage. But as you said before, if you go back 10 years and look at what we’ve done from a margin point of view it’s hard to imagine doing something like that going forward. So I think that’s the best way to think about where we’ve got to drive growth.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it, got it. I want to ask a question about the 300 millimeter. So obviously, this is something that you guys were looking at as crazy when you started it. It certainly paid massive dividends since, and you’re doubling down on it now. And so you’re building a new facility in Texas. Can you just give us any, I guess, not an update, but refresh our memory on what’s going on with that 300 millimeter fab right now and what’s the timing of production. And I guess, do you see the same amount – I guess, is it the same amount of potential cost savings given it’s going to be much more built out of new equipment versus used equipment?
Rich Templeton
Yes. So I’ll work backwards. We got a lot of attention when we made the move with 300 millimeter that G we got great deals in terms of what we paid for used equipment. And it’s always nice to do that. I don’t want to deny that. But the real secret behind 300 millimeter is the wafer diameter and the fact that with that wafer diameter, you get a 40% reduction in your chip cost compared to somebody building on 200 millimeter. And when you think about the fact that you operate these fabs for 30-plus years, that’s all the money, whether you bought the equipment new or used, that’s just a nice to have to go along with it.
Stacy Rasgon
Because you can use it for forever, basically.
Rich Templeton
Just you’ve got to look at the numbers and even though, everybody loves it cheaper, it just doesn’t – it’s just not that big number compared to the area under the curve for the long-term. So we’ve really been thrilled with what we’ve done at the Renner Road site, where we built our fab one and then to your point, we’ve got the second facility on that site coming up right now, cranes are above the sky. We should have that building closed and as we get to the end of this year, equipment moving in the first half of 2022. And we should start having early production coming out of there in the second half of 2022.
So that’s the timing of that coming up. And that would then give us a 300 millimeter fab called DMOS6 at the Expressway site. And then those two factories up on the Renner site as well. So we’re just – to me, this one is so obvious. It was so obvious 10 years ago that you just want to continue to grow your 300 millimeter capacity as a percentage of your total output, because of the cost benefits let alone the control of supply chain benefits that you get from it.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it, got it. And that’ll be an additional $5 billion in incremental revenue capacity once it’s fully built out.
Rich Templeton
In that zip code is the easiest way to think about it just how we’ve parameterized even DMOS6 plus RFAB 1. It’s obviously always going to vary depending on what exact mix of process you build, mask layer counts that that go along with it. But that site is really going to turn into a great workhorse facility. It will deliver us probably a 10 to 15-year growth in terms of what that asset looks like and what will – what it will do for us.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it, got it. I want to talk now about capital allocation and cash return. And again, you were probably one of the first companies to talk about returning 100% or more free cash flow, many companies do it now, you were probably the first. At the same time, they’re a little earlier in this conversation, you talked about the potential opportunity to reduce share count depending on valuations. And we look back the last few quarters, you guys haven’t bought it back hardly any stock. And I think this is the first time in a while that your kind of total return is actually under 100%. And so I guess, how do we square that circle? Is that just – I mean, is it just a matter that you guys are as disciplined on the buyback as you are and everything else, or like, how do we think about the reduction in the buyback in recent quarters.
Rich Templeton
Yes. Stacy, I think Rafael answered that pretty well in April, when I think he got a version of that question on the earnings call of 100%, does it mean by week, by month, by quarter, by year, it means over time. And the short answer is, yes. We try to be very disciplined. We look at that return of capital with the same discipline that we look at putting dollars into R&D or dollars into CapEx, because it really is our responsibility of how we allocate those dollars most effectively for the owners.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Rich, I want to go to a few of the audience questions, because we’re getting close to the end of our time, like, this goes very quick. Somebody is asking about the tie up – the forthcoming tie up between ADI and Maxim and asking what you thought it might do industry rationality or competitiveness, if anything.
Rich Templeton
Yes. I would just go down the path, because I’ve had that variation of that question four – as you noted Stacy, four or five years now with different acquisitions that have taken place in the chip market. And I think in general, the chip market has been pretty well behaved for the past seven or eight years, to where if you’re disciplined, where you focus, you do a good job with your investments, you can generate good rates of return. So I think the market is going to – and I think M&A has probably been a portion of that discipline, but not the only reason. And then certainly supply demand imbalances, like, we’re in right now was even more disciplined to that general environment. So I think – you’ve heard me say, I think the environment for discipline is going to remain pretty good over the next 10 years.
And then in terms of competitive dynamics changing for us, go back toward discussion about how we invest and how we look at our competitive advantages. And I always look at M&A and I say, it’s something that has changed our competitive advantages. Does it change 300 millimeter manufacturing, okay, inside that company? No. Does it change the channel reach and capabilities? No. And so that’s the way I think you’ve always got to evaluate, what’s happening in the market. So we’re pretty comfortable where we are. We’re very aggressive. We know what we have to go do, but I think that those investments are going to continue to return for us.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Because we have time for one more on here as well. Question on like, why customers are picking a TI chip over the competition. Is it just portfolio breadth? Is it reputation? Is it availability? Like, what is it about TI. Or frankly, even one of your competitors that drives a customer, like to one to one supplier or another.
Rich Templeton
Yes. To me, it begins with very simple who makes it the easiest for customers to find, evaluate, select, put it on the board, and then once it’s on the board have no issues. That’s a design engineer’s dream, okay, in terms of what they want to be able to do things. And so everything that was talked about in that question is what you got to, you have to have breadth because that way, if the design engineer comes to your site, they know they’re going to have options to be able to get to a good answer. You’ve got to help them get to that good solution and then go all the way to the end. Yes, it does help when you’ve got availability and products, okay, because designers don’t have to go back and redesign their board. So if we’re doing our job well, we’re doing a better job than competitors on all those phases, as you think about moving from evaluation to production.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. So we are at the top of our time, Rich, I’m going to give you your final 30 seconds soap box here. You’ve got a whole bunch of folks on the line. Some may be familiar with TI, maybe some not as familiar. Why should investors buy TI stock?
Rich Templeton
I think the simplest one to me, Stacy, is just that we’re going to operate the place like owners and we’re going to operate it like owners that are going to own a place for decades. You’ll see it and how we make decisions now we invest money, how we spend money, how we return money. And that’s going to be really that what drives us. And that’s – if you got to spend time internal, you would see it live it and feel it. And that to me is the most important thing that we can promise and commit and then go do.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. I think we’ll leave it there. Rich, thank you so much for being with us today. I really appreciate it, as always it’s been a pleasure
Rich Templeton
Stacy, again, thanks for the opportunity. And I look forward to seeing you on all your times on CNBC with all your exposure these days.
Stacy Rasgon
I’ll try to oblige. Thank you very much.

Thank you for standing by. Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Q1 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and will provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter; next, I'll provide insight into the first quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end market, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time; and then lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insights into onetime items, and our guidance for the second quarter of 2021.
Starting with a quick overview of the first quarter. The company’s revenue increased 5% sequentially and 29% year-over-year driven by strong demand in industrial, automotive and personal electronics. On a sequential basis, Analog grew 5% and Embedded Processing grew 7%.
On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 33% and Embedded Processing grew 17%. Our other segment grew 12% from a year ago quarter. Moving on, given the current environment, again this quarter, I’ll provide some insights into our first quarter revenue by end market and then some comments on our lead times.
First, the industrial market was up about 20% sequentially and up almost 30% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most sectors. The automotive market was about even compared to a very strong fourth quarter 2020 and up about 25% from a year ago.
Compared to the pre-COVID-19 levels the fourth of 2019 our shipments to automotives in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 were up about 25% as we work to help our automotive customers recover from their supply chain disruptions.
Personal electronics was down about 10% sequentially and up about 50% compared to the year ago. The strength was broad based across sectors and customers within personal electronics.
Next communications equipment grew in the high teens sequentially, and was about even from the year ago. Enterprise systems grew upper single digit sequentially, and was down about 10% from the year ago. Regarding lead times, over 80% of our products have steady lead times, and more than 50,000 parts have off the shelf availability via ti.com. However, the growing demand in the first quarter of 2021 did expand our list of hotspots, which required extending some lead times. We will continue to add incremental capacity in 2021 and the first half of 2022 with additional support from the start-up of our third 300 millimeter wafer fab, RFAB II that will come online in the second half of 2022.
As discussed during our Capital Management Review in February, our competitive advantage of internal manufacturing and technology delivers the benefits of lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, which really shows through a market environment like this.
Raphael will now look and review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon everyone. First quarter revenue was $4.3 billion up 29% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion, or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 250 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $811 million, up 2% from a year ago. And about as expected, on a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 21% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, acquisition charges and non-cash expense were $47 million in the first quarter.
Acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021 and then go to zero. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter or 45% of revenue. Operating profit was up 56% from a year ago quarter.
Net income in the first quarter was $1.8 billion, or $1.87 per share, which included a $0.02 net benefit that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to discrete tax benefit, which was partially offset by about $50 million of utility costs related to the February winter storm in Texas. Most of this expense is in our cost of revenue and reported in our other segment results.
Let me now comment our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $308 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.3 billion. In the quarter we paid $940 million in dividends and repurchase $100 million of our stock.
In total, we have returned $4.5 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 56% of free cash flow underscoring its sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $6.7 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the first quarter. We retire $550 million of debt in the quarter leaving $6.3 billion of total debt with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%.
Regarding inventory, TI-inventory dollars were down $65 million from the prior quarter, and dates were 114. For the second quarter, we expect TI-revenue in the range of $4.13 to $4.47 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.92. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 14%.
In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions in order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question after our response we’ll provide you the opportunity for an additional follow up, operator?
"
2021-04-27,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Chris Danley with Citi.
Christopher Danley
Hey, thanks, guys. So Q1 clearly was very strong, well above seasonality and above guidance, however, your sequential guidance is flat is well below seasonality. So my question is, are you guys seeing, cancellations and push outs or why that's such weak guidance after a strong Q1? Thanks.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, Chris. Yes, thanks for that question. We aren’t seeing cancellation or push outs. I just say that if you look into, to your observations, Q1 was very strong both sequentially, and year-on-year. So, at the midpoint, second quarter will be a strong quarter from a year-on-year standpoint, you have a follow up.
Christopher Danley
Yes, I mean, I guess would just be a follow on to the first question, this would be the lowest sequential guidance you guys have given in some time. So I guess why not? Why not guide for a seasonal or even close seasonal sequential guide?
Dave Pahl
Yes, it really Chris it is the best estimate that we have for our revenue for the quarter. And, again, I would describe it as, following a very strong first quarter. It will, it will be a strong quarter again. So okay, thank you. We'll go to the next caller.
Operator
And next we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research
Stacy Rasgon
Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to talk about your inventory strategy. I know you have a strategy to build out inventory for customer service. I guess how do I reconcile that that with the fact that your inventory dollars are down, and you're still getting some pockets of lead time of extended weakens? Is that just a function of demand of the poles is just so strong you can't keep up? And I guess in that light, how do you parse the quality of those orders that you're getting? How do you know? Are you just having to just shipping whatever is being asked for at this point? And I guess, like what are the plans for loadings and inventories as we go into Q2, you're going to try to replenish the inventory that's been drained?
Rafael Lizardi
Now, so thanks for your question, Stacy. So first, let me step back and remind everyone inventory our objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service minimize, while we minimize obsolescence and improve manufacturing realization. And as you alluded in the question, we would prefer to have higher levels of inventory. In fact, what 60 days ago a day capital management strategy, we increased the target for inventory to 130 to 190 days up from 115, 145. Prior to that, so yes, we'd like to have more inventory. But in the current environment, we're focusing our capacity on fulfilling demand, not on building inventory, whenever things slowdown, which at some point that will, or and or as we increase capacity, which we are increasing capacity incrementally, we have them will continue to their to the balance of this year into the first half of next year. And then in the second half of next year, we will have a first output from our RFAB II as those things come together, then we will be able to build more inventory. I know you had a couple other parts of that question. But why don't you use your follow up for that if I missed something?
Stacy Rasgon
Okay, I'll use the follow up. So how are you parsing the quality of the orders that you're getting? Are you just skipping whatever is being ordered at this point?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, and I'm glad you I'm glad you chose that one as a follow up. I'll just highlight, as you know, we have moved away from distributors over the last couple years, really, it's been more of a 10 year process. But in the last few years, more, we pulled the trigger and actually no longer ship into too many distributors that we used to. And now we're going direct with, with a lot of our customers.
To the point where, we exited last year with almost two thirds of our revenue, shipping direct, that has put us in a great position, particularly in the current environment. Because we have, we now have more direct access to those customers who have a better understanding of what they really need. We have, we don't have that intermediary in between frankly, clouding things up. As frankly as the way it happened a lot with the distributor. So, so then we use that information to better allocate our resources, both inventory, manufacturing, etcetera, in order to fulfill demand from our customers.
Dave Pahl
That's great. Thank you, Stacy. Now we’ll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes, good afternoon, guys. I think somebody asked the question, not original but a follow up to the June revenue guide. I'm just curious Rafael; you said did you would be growing supply sequentially from March to June. So the implication is, you might be able to build some inventory in your own balance sheet. I'm just curious, given how lean inventories are across the channel. Why would you wouldn't expect incremental supply that you bring on, not to be used by your customers and actually show sequential revenue growth?
Rafael Lizardi
I think you're getting a little new ones in that question and picking some of the things I said. Just I would you, we drain inventory fourth to first, right? So even if we're increasing output, that doesn't necessarily mean that we'll be able to build inventory. What I said earlier, you shouldn't take that as a statement that we're going to build inventory going into second quarter.
Rafael Lizardi
And I would add that we're going to add incremental inventory or incremental capacity through the balance of this year, and through the first half of this next year, until RFAB II comes on, which would be in the second half of 2022. So, you've got multiple pieces that are moving there. You have a follow on, John?
John Pitzer
Yes. Just it was nice to see in the March quarter embedded at least sequentially, growing faster than analog. And we've talked about this in the past, Dave, about kind of the growth there is kind of lag that of analog, do you feel like within the embedded market, you're turning the corner on it? Can you help us kind of understand how you guys see the design funnel there? And what the growth rate in that market might be beyond kind of the cyclical recovery?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, I'll give you a few comments on that. And, Dave, you want to follow up. But high level, we're pleased with the trajectory of embedded. We're still -- however, we're still in very early phases, right? As we have said before, our goal with embedded was first to stabilize embedded, make some changes that we have made and then leverage our competitive advantages that we have to -- have embedded headed in a better direction. And we're in the early phases, but we're pleased with those early results.
John Pitzer
Great. Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Moving on, we'll go to Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach
Dave, thanks for the color on lead times. I guess, in the hotspots, maybe 20% or so that's been impacted? Can you just give a sense of what you're seeing there? And maybe your sense of when you would expect that the lead times in certain areas has to normalize?
Dave Pahl
Yes. There's just a lot of moving pieces on that to correct that. I think it's probably premature to try to pick that. Our teams are obviously working very hard with customers to close those demand and fulfill those needs. So it really just based on technologies and packages and what those customer requirements are. You have a follow on?
Craig Hettenbach
Sure. Thanks. And then, personal electronics, up 50%. Year-over-year, I know there's been some nice tailwinds from work from home. Any more color in terms of some of the segments that you're seeing growth? And how you feel about that business for Q2?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So at a high level, what I'd say, we'll give color by end market, if there's something unusual going on. When we look out into a quarter, I can say that there's nothing unusual that we feel the need to call out. When we look back into first quarter, and really in the past few quarters in personal electronics, the demand that we've seen there has been very broad based, both by customer, really across the board that we've seen, as well as by sector. So -- and just as a reminder, in spite of personal electronics, we'll have things like handsets and tablets and personal computers, including laptops, televisions, smart speakers, those types of things. So it's a pretty broad category -- printers. So it's pretty broad categories. I think there is nine, ten different sectors that make up personal electronics. So -- and we've seen very strong demand across -- really across all of those.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. This is Rafael. I just want to go back to the question lead times. Earlier, several people asked about inventory. At the end of the day, things are going to be tied as long as demand is ahead of supply, things are going to be tied, lead times are going to be tied. But the key point here is we own our own manufacturing and technology, right? That is a key differentiator versus our competitors. It is one of our competitive advantages. So we are in a strategically -- in a unique strategic position to be able to have that control that inventory, be able to add to that capacity incrementally for the next year and a half or so. But then more significantly after that when RFAB II is built, and it starts to get equipped. So that's a big difference versus our competitors. It really puts us in a much better position to fulfill customer's demand, both short term and more importantly, over the long haul, as we continue to focus on industrial automotive, all those customers that are in those great spaces.
Dave Pahl
Good color. Yes. Thank you. Okay. We'll go to the next caller. Please.
Operator
Thank you. And that will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon, Thanks for answering my question. On the extended lead times maybe a different way to ask the question. You also asked about 20% of your wafer requirements, most of it is embedded and you outsource, 40% of your test and assembly. I'm just wondering if this is where you're seeing maybe more of the extended lead times just given the capacity as tight as your outsourced partners? Or is it across both internal and outsourced manufacturers?
Dave Pahl
Yes. It's not specifically there, Harlan. It really is more just based on technology or end market driven or package types. So, we've described it as hotspots. So it's kind of a combination of those things when we've got demand that is outstripping the short term supply. But back to Rafael's point. The fact that we do the majority of that assembly test in-house, most of our peers don't do that. Most of our peers have that assembly outside. So even that 60%, 70% is a very large number that we control and do in-house. Also, because we do 80% of our wafers in-house, we can expand that capacity incrementally. Also, we control the cost to a much higher degrees than our peers as well. And those are very important things in times like these. So it’s a tremendous advantage. On top of the fact that 300 millimeter, we're adding capacity. So it's coming in at structurally lower cost in addition to it. So, you have a follow on.
Harlan Sur
Yes. No. Thanks for the insights there. So good again to see the year-over-year momentum in the embedded business. And I know somebody tried to ask a question about this previously, but wondering if you could just -- I know you guys refocus some of the sub segments within embedded last year. Just wondering if you guys could give us a profile of embedded relative to the overall corporate profile? I mean, does it have the same end market exposure as the overall business? Or is it more skewed now towards one or particular end markets? And on a go forward basis like what end markets within embedded are you spending more R&D dollars?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, I think that -- what the investments that we have in embedded, we have directed at the best growth opportunities. So, as we took a step back, we wanted to focus them into that direction. They are bias towards industrial and the automotive markets. The largest portion of our revenue are pointed in those two markets as well. We do have a little bit of revenue in communications enterprise and PE [ph] inside of that, but the majority of the revenue is in those two markets. So, again, as Rafael said, we're in the early stages. Our first objective was to get the revenue stabilized. So, we feel very good about the progress that we've made so far. And we're making the investments there because we believe embedded will be a great contributor to free cash flow growth over the long term. So, we believe that several years from now we'll look back and we'll be very pleased with the investments that we've made. We'll be very pleased with the free cash flow growth that embedded will have contributed to the company. So, okay. Thank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Thank you. And that will come from Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thank you very much. Just a question on the order patterns that you're seeing guys. Many of your peers have talked about no cancellations policies, facets of the business we haven't seen in -- and you could say never. But are you think that that customers are looking for commitments to capacity, and then as a result, you're having to change your clauses with the customers in terms of cancellation policy, or what have you. Are there any changes on that front?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, we don't think that that's a good idea to go down that path to force customers to tell us what they need a year from now. I don't -- you can demand that they tell you what they need in April or May of 2022. But I can assure you, they don't know what they need a year from now. We really want to be in a position where we can supply them what they need, and be a supplier that they can count on as well. Our competitive advantage of manufacturing technology and owning controlling that our manufacturing asset also gives us control of our costs there. So we haven't been in a position where we've had to go in and raise prices as many of our other peers have. So -- and we believe that those two things combined are translating into share gains, right? So, when you look at the revenues in this quarter, we believe part of that is share gains. And I'll quickly also point out that. You got to measure that over time. So don't look at or measure it over just one quarter. But we do believe that will be something that will benefit us for a very long time to come. You have follow on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes, I do. Just quickly on the capacity and CapEx. So, intensity, we shouldn't be modeling a different intensity over the next few quarters, correct? We should be within the guidance range that you've given as you build the third Fab? And then, is that second half 2022 a pull in versus what you were expecting?
Rafael Lizardi
No, it's not a pull in. That's about where we've always expected. But now let me answer the first part of your question. As you as you know very well, you've been following us for a while. We talked about our guide for CapEx as percent of revenue at about 6%. We did that at the capital management strategy meeting. And that is -- that's a valid number over the long term. And it's just a model to help you think about our CapEx. But the reality is that in the short term for two, three years, we're going to run higher than that in absolute terms, and also the percent of revenue as we continue to invest both short term to get ahead of the current situation, but more importantly, longer term as we continue to strengthen our competitive advantage of having our own manufacturing technology, particularly 300 millimeter that as we talked about, provides such a great structural cost advantage in controlling our own manufacturing supply they've been is that early during this pandemic, and cycle has proven worthwhile.
Dave Pahl
Okay, Thank you, Ambrish. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Thank you. And that question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. Dave, I just -- I also wanted to ask about the guidance. I know there's some school of thought that because you control your supply chain, and that your model and inventory would sort of drive some share gains and some more upside given what's going on. And I know that you're typically conservative, and you have a very tough comp on Q1. But I wonder if maybe customers are not pulling your product because of shortages elsewhere? Because it just is, sitting there in consignment anyway, waiting for them? And I guess the question is, are you hearing that from any of your customers that they're not pulling due to shortages elsewhere? And maybe that's contributing somewhat to your June guidance?
Rafael Lizardi
Tim, we think that that probably goes on at any point. Though, we don't believe that that's going on at any significant level. So yes, we don't believe that that's a significant factor that's going on in second quarter. You have follow on?
Timothy Arcuri
Yes. I do. So I guess last, the same thing that I asked last quarter about the share repo. And I know that you guys always say that free cash flow only matters if it's returned. But you didn't buy back much again this quarter. It's like $130 million over the past nine months. And it's sort of seems like maybe a bit of a pattern now that it's three quarters in a row? So, and I know you have a pretty strong in trinsic value model for your stock. So can you just talk about that? Thanks.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, sure. No, thanks. First, stepping back, as you alluded to our goal, our objective is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company over the long term. And if you look at our 15, 16 year history on that front, we have been returning all free cash flow and then some to the owners of the company. And we're going to continue doing that over time. Now over time -- over the long term. That means --that doesn't necessarily mean every quarter, certainly not every quarter, maybe not even every year, right? But over the long term, we're going to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through both dividends and buybacks. And there are different criteria that we look at for each of those, and we've talked about that.
Dave Pahl
Okay. We've got time for one more caller.
Operator
Thank you. And that question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg
Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the record revenues and earnings. First question. Dave or Rafael, could you just step back just looking at the last 90 days, what is it exactly that changed this last quarter? Did orders continue to accelerate? Does the capacity situation ease? Maybe just walk through exactly what changed?
Rafael Lizardi
I'll give you a few comments. Not sure if I have -- perhaps what you're looking for. But demand continues to be strong. We're still in a environment where demand exceeds supply capacity. Now, of course, our revenue has continued growing in that environment, and both year-on-year clearly, but also sequentially, right? And we are incrementally adding capacity while we do that. We're also in the -- while we have done that we have over this entire cycle, we have focused on making the company stronger, right? So we have back, if you look at the first phase of this pandemic, back in February or March, when everybody was pulling back, we built through that cycle. So that was a tactical decision enabled by our strategic position of our focus on industrial automotive, on catalog part with low risk, obsolescence, so we're able to build through that cycle. And be prepared for the other side, once demand started returning pretty quickly as it turned out.
We also -- as we did that we also gain a strategic ground, focusing on auto and industrial. So you've seen how we have grown in those phases. And while we have done that we have invested for the long term. And that's invested in competitive advantages, the most obvious one is manufacturing technology. We already talked about that here. But there's also our product portfolio, right? We continue to strengthen the R&D in the best basis. And then the other one is free to have channels, which we really haven't talked about today much. But we continue to strengthen that and may be the most obvious one is the other comp, and everything we're doing there to support our customers with very, very high availability, in fact, immediate availability in a lot of cases with many parts, that's inventory there for customers to buy direct from us on the other comp.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg
Yes. Thank you. So your operating margin, I think was just very shy of a record 45.2%. Rafael, in the past, you've talked about OpEx kind of being between 20% and 30% of revenue. Now that -- it's pretty obvious that there's so much demand out there and that it's sustainable. Is it safe to say that OpEx ratio is going to change going forward and maybe stay at 20% to 25%?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So what I will tell you on that is in the short term, we run OpEx on a trailing 12 month basis at about $3.2 billion. That's not going to change much in the short term, right? Because it doesn't need to. Right? We feel very good about those investments, we feel very good about where they're going. They're long term in nature. Clearly in R&D, but also, part of SG&A is, is, the telecom example, that's, we think of as an investment, of course, even those it’s in SG&A. So we I don't see that number, in the short term changing much, but over the long term, over many years, the guidance that we have given you of 20% to 25% still apply. So, so you should still think of it in those terms.
Rafael Lizardi
Okay, so I think that was the last one. So let me go ahead and wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously, that our core were engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and best metric to measure progress and generate long term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions; we will act like owners who will own the company for decades, we will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would want us our neighbour. And we're successful. Our employees, customers, communities and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening.
Operator
Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.

2021-03-01,Q&A," Session
Q - Craig Hettenbach
Great. I’m just going to read a disclosure for investors. The Morgan Stanley research disclosure website can be found at www.MorganStanley.com\ResearchDisclosures.
So with that, if we can just kick off, starting with the supply chain tightness, and how that’s impacting your business kind of today, but probably more importantly, from a strategic sense, just how it plays into kind of TI’s manufacturing strategy and what your strengths are.
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, sure. So let me start with that. And, I’ll start on the strategic angle that you just gave. As you know, we have 4 competitive advantages. The one is owning our own manufacturing and technology, particularly 300 millimeter wafer fabs. And the value of that strategy was proving once again, in this environment, by owning those factories, controlling them has put us in a really good position to do very well in this pandemic.
The other angle that I would give you is our approach our business model of focusing on catalog parts in the analog and embedded space, and from an end market in industrial automotive, with very long product life cycles. So, that strategy has enabled us to build inventory that lasts years, if not, decades. So then, we don’t worry about obsolescence of that inventory very much. There’s very little risk of that. So that’s why we generally have inventory levels that are higher than our competitors.
And we think that’s a good investment. And again, the pandemic and what we went through and still going through has proven that. On the more tactical level, lead times remain generally stable and short, but there are pockets of tightness, there’s no question about. Automotive is maybe the area that would highlight, everybody has read about that in the papers and some of what’s going on there.
So we’re after 9 months of strong demand, at some point it gets to a point where that becomes a little tight. But generally speaking, we are withstanding that and doing much better than competitors on that front.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And then, you mentioned automotive, which it feels like most pronounced in terms of the snapback that we’ve seen in that market. Any other markets that feel on the tight side, as you see it today?
Rafael Lizardi
Probably the only one that I would highlight, yeah.
Craig Hettenbach
Okay. And how about in terms of customer engagements and maybe even longer-term agreements for visibility? Are you seeing any behavior in terms of how customers are responding to how tight things are? I know it’s a more recent phenomenon, but just what is it doing in terms of some of the customer engagements you have in running the business?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, what I would tell you is our focus, as I said earlier, is on catalog parts. So again, catalog defined as parts that are sold to 10 customers, sometimes 15, sometimes even 30 different customers. So we can – and primarily in the industrial automotive market, but not only in those markets, of course, we sell into personal electronics and communications and others.
But that puts us in a position where we can build inventory, have a very good availability, very, very short lead-time. So then, we’re not in a position then to be – for our customers to be worried about supply to having to order ahead of time or to place long-term agreements or any of that sort of anything. We’re moving the opposite way on that, just having more and more availability.
Just to comment on capital management, about a month ago, we talked about how we are so confident on that strategy and feel so good about it. We’re increasing our target for inventory days to 130 to 190. That’s a guideline. That’s not a hard number, but it just gives you the confidence that we have in the strategy, because it’s such a good asymmetric bet to have that inventory, invested a capital, invested inventory, so that when customers as need it they know they can count on us to provide the short lead-times part.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And, Rafael, can we touch on just U.S. manufacturing? I mean, there’s a lot in the press recently about U.S. policy and things, as they kind of look to address some of these, which arguably are a much longer-term issue in terms of being able to respond to it and maybe enact some change. But as one of the larger U.S. semi manufacturers, are there any types of benefits that that TI can see through some potential changes in policy?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, so our position when it comes to policy is it’s threefold: 1, low taxes; 2, free trade; and then, skilled talent. And when it comes to taxes, for example, 3 or 4 years ago, when tax reform was passed, that finally put the United States in a more level playing field compared to what other countries around the world do for technology companies, specifically, semiconductor. So, encouragement would be to maintain or improve that level playing field.
And there are various things going through to Congress and the people are talking about in that regard. There’s also a lot of talk about increasing the tax rate, right. So we’ll see what the net effect of all that will be. But at the end of the day, it’d be important for the United States to have that level playing field for semiconductor companies.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And then, any updates on the 300 millimeter view in terms of just timeline of the next fab, just kind of where things stand? And then, from a longer-term perspective, what that means in terms of incremental revenue, that you can grow into longer-term?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, so no change. So I’ll just tell you what we talked about at the last Capital Management Meeting, which is we’re building the third 300-millimeter factory. It’s going to be here in Texas, in Richardson. It should be ready to have output potential in the second half of next year. Once it’s built, and then once it’s fully equipped, which will happen over time, that factory will have the potential of $5 billion of annual revenue.
Okay, so that will increment our existing footprint, particularly in 300 millimeter, as we have talked about, that just gives us a tremendous advantage, not just owning our own manufacturing, but having the best cost structure in the industry.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And as you referenced the recent Capital Management update, there are a couple of small tweaks that you made. You increased the dividend payout as a percent of free cash flow, also raised the inventory, kind of band of targets that you look at. Can you just talk about both of those things?
And it does feed into – there was a question over the webcast around buybacks. And just, again, if it’s a subtle kind of shift, a little bit more towards dividends, how are you thinking about the cash return aspect of it?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, yeah, happy to. So on inventory I pretty much addressed that already, but just to reiterate, we’re confident on our inventory strategy – it all starts with a business model and our competitive advantage is that how that works. And that enables us to then have carry higher levels of inventory and feel really good about the trade-off there between tying up some cash on the balance sheet for inventory. But the potential benefits that come with that, to have really good availability, short lead-times for our customers.
On the dividend, and let me first step back, our commitment has been and continues to be to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. If you look at our history for 15-plus-years, that’s what we have done. And we have done that through dividends and buybacks.
If you look back 10, 15 years ago, dividend was a relatively smaller portion of that versus buybacks. Over the last 15 years that has even out more with buybacks about 50/50 and it varies, obviously, buybacks are more discretionary.
But at the last Capital Management update, we tweaked the dividend metric. It was 40% to 60% of free cash flow. We took that to 40% to 80%. That’s just to convey that we would be confident in the sustainability, affordability and growth of that dividend anywhere in that range, whether it’s 40%, or 80%, anywhere in that range would be comfortable with that.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And also, as part of the Capital Management update, you talked about kind of R&D. Certainly auto and industrial been focused markets, but you’re also investing in other markets like personal electronics. And so, yeah, how does the company go about prioritizing where to spend what markets makes the most sense?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, I’ll start on that, and Rafael, if you want to add it. I’d say that when we look across the markets, we find good opportunities in all of the markets. And so those – a good opportunity is a product that we’ve got a level of differentiation of product that can sell to multiple customers across multiple and equipment, ideally, across multiple sectors and markets. And when you find opportunities like that, they tend to live a long time. So those are the types of opportunities that that we’re looking towards. And you just find more of those types of opportunities in the industrial and automotive market. So that will continue to be a priority for us. But we’ll continue to follow in find good opportunities in our markets.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. Let me just to follow that, can you talk about scale, because I think sometimes that’s something that comes up in discussions around just how much you spend on an absolute basis versus a percent of sales? And how important is that scale that you have in terms of leveraging the investments that you’re making? And like you said, having these products going to multiple different markets?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, I think, I’ll bring it to one of our competitive advantages, which is the breadth of our portfolio. So if you look at the breadth of our portfolio, it isn’t so much scale, but it’s – we’ve got products in a lot of the sub-segments of analog as well in embedded that just gives us the opportunity to participate in more projects at customers, more sockets per project, and just sell more content in each of those projects. So to the ability for each of our investments, it just allows us to find more homes for each of those investments. So that’s what that scale if you will, scale by itself isn’t the advantage. It’s necessary, but not sufficient, probably, a good way to describe it.
Craig Hettenbach
Yeah. Thanks. And maybe we can shift gears towards the distribution strategy. And you’ve been taking the business more direct in recent years. And I think that’s mostly run its course. But just, if you can just reiterate kind of what are some of the key highlights of this in advantages for protects and versus perhaps some of the competitors, who is still relying more heavily on distribution?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, I think if you look at the shift that we had this year just described it as substantial. And, we’ve been working towards that for years. And, it just in general, just been thrilled with the increase direct relationship with our customers, and the early results that we’re seeing there. So we started the year with about one-third of our revenue coming direct to TI, we left the year with two-thirds of the revenue coming direct. And that number may continue to increase a little bit, but probably not substantially higher.
And, again, we’re already seeing that the benefits of it, and we’ll get benefits of higher growth just really through more access to the customers projects, the sockets per project, and really just insight into what our customers are doing. And we really believe that that will be an advantage that just will be difficult for many of our competitors to replicate. So…
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And if you think about just as the strategies unfolded, are there any differences by geography in terms of maybe with direct you take all that and it makes sense versus if distribution still has a role, and it’s still [a third of your] [ph] business, I know, some of that is just fulfillment. But just how do you think about geography and does that influence in parts where you still are using distribution? Does that play an important role?
Dave Pahl
No, I wouldn’t say it’s based on geography. I think that the operating side of the houses for our customers have many needs, but a couple of those needs is availability and pricing or cost of our products, and my having a direct relationship certainly will have the best availability, because we own and control the inventory of our products and going direct with us, we have the best pricing available. And, there may be a need for customers to have services from a distributor, and that’s – there’s no problem with that. And customers find great value in it. So regardless of what region that they’re in, should they find that value, though, negotiate and discuss with the distributor, what that value is and what services they’ll provide. So we’ll see that continue really into the future, because of the services that they provide.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. Can you just talk about industry consolidation across semis, and specifically in analog and microcontrollers? And just curious, as we’ve seen this consolidation, are there anything that you’re seeing kind of change at the margin in terms of competitive dynamics?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, what I would tell you, if you step back over the last 20 years, we’ve had a few periods in our history, where we – acquisitions have made sense for us where we have found opportunities to strengthen our competitive advantages. As we mentioned earlier, scale is a component of that, but it’s not sufficient, not the only thing, but it did help us broaden the portfolio, get some scale on the manufacturing front. And the last one was in 2011, with the National acquisition. And since then, our focus has been and will continue to be organic growth is to then continue to strengthen and then leverage those competitive advantages. And just in our sense that much better efficient effective strategy, just – and again, given where we are today, not to mention the valuations in the industry have been such data, even if we wanted to it’d be difficult to justify some of those acquisitions.
Craig Hettenbach
Understood. And then for the analog industry, what’s your guy’s sense in terms of just longer term growth? And why that’s relative to GDP or kind of a mix of your business? But, yeah, how do you think about that on a longer term basis that the growth potential in the business?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, as we have talked about it in previous years, I don’t think our view has changed much on that is a sub point or 2, as an industry hired, and then GDP because semiconductor content continues to grow. And we are – on top of that, we’re gaining share – we have gained share pretty consistently. And we’re in the best markets, industrial, automotive, where the content growth is growing even faster than in other places. So we ended up we can think of our target as being a few points ahead of GDP.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And maybe switching gears to the embedded market, there’s been some more change for TI there in recent years, and companies talked about where it wants to prioritize investments and shifted some investments, but maybe just talk about really the decision process behind that. And in terms of how you’re trying to optimize that business and where you play.
Dave Pahl
Yeah, I would say that, if you look at that business overall, our first objective with that business was to get the business stabilized. And I would say that we’re pleased with the progress that that we’ve seen there. And we’re investing in that business. And we really what we need to do at this point is to prove that we can grow that business sustainably over the long-term that will take some time to prove out. And, we want to have products that will reach a broad set of customers that play to our competitive advantages. And we’re focused and working very hard to do that. And again, we’re making those investments, because we believe that that business will contribute to free cash flow growth over the long term.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And, Dave, in the business that remains in terms of that you’re optimizing around. Is it similar in terms of growth prospects relative to GDP? Are there any puts and takes of how you think about embedded versus analog longer-term?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, we think both the analog and embedded businesses are big enough pieces of the semiconductor market that they’ll both grow about the same rate from a market standpoint. And if we’re executing well, we will continue to gain share and both of those markets, so they both have the same growth potential.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. Okay. I wanted to dig into just some of the end markets and growth in the company, certainly seen a pretty substantial change of mix over the years towards auto and industrial. And I know both of these markets are really broad based in terms of the applications that you play. But, one area that’s gotten increased attention in the last year is the inflection in EVs, and we’d love to talk about just kind of what that means for TI kind of where you think you’re positioned, and of the certain kind of technologies there that are best suited for you to capitalize on.
Dave Pahl
Yeah, our strategy in automotive has been very intentionally to have a broad based footprint. So we could measure that and a couple of different directions, one is by looking at the sectors, so electric vehicles would sit in a sector we call power train systems. So that would also pick up hybrids, but we’ve got 4 other sectors, we’re investing, which include infotainment, and cluster displays, ADAS systems, safety systems, and then body electronics and lighting. So we often joke about getting design wins and taillights, there’s lots of semiconductor content today and turn signals and taillights, and nobody writes articles about it, it’s not very exciting. But we’d like that kind of content.
And if you look at our product portfolio, we’ve got 65 different product lines that the company 45 of those product lines, ship products into the automotive industry. And then if you look at a customer standpoint, we’ve got probably close to 1,000 different automotive OEMs. And of course, the revenue will be weighted towards the Tier 1s. But if you take any Tier 1, we’ll have 1,000 – a couple of 1,000 different products that will ship to any Tier 1, so again, trying to build on that breadth of products and the competitive advantage, which is diversity and long lived position. So I think automotive is just a great example of that competitive advantage.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. In similar to how we talked about just overall more broadly kind of growth pointed to about GDP, is there a way that you kind of think about automotive relative to production in terms of what some of the growth prospects there?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, I think that both automotive and industrial are both the markets where you’ve got content that’s being expanding, right. And if you just look backwards, as a frame of reference over the last 10, or even 15 years, you’ve had autos are growing somewhere between 1% and 3%, where the semiconductor market or TAM in that market has probably grown somewhere in the upper-single-digits. And people pick different numbers inside of that. That’s an easier number to get to and to identify, because any semiconductor company knows when you’re shipping into automotive, because there are certain standards and things that you need to do with products.
And we can count the number of cars that are being shipped per year. Industrial has the same type of content expansion that’s going on. But in that market, we’ve got 13 different sectors and hundreds, if not, thousands of end-equipments that we’re shipping to. So you can’t quite dimensionalize it so easily. But really the same type of opportunity, but just a lot more diversified and hence why we really like the opportunity there.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And then, maybe just following up on that industrial and appreciate kind of the 5 buckets in autos that you kind of look to drive growth and now there’s even more of that within the industrial segment, but any of those that you would highlight within industrial from an application perspective that will produce strong growth?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, it’s the beauty of industrial and I often get teased that I bore people when I talk about all 13 of the different sectors that we’re investing in. And as we define industrial, every semiconductor company may define it slightly different, unlike automotive where it’s pretty clean cut.
But our definition will include things that the financial community would obviously identify as industrial, like factory automation or building automation, grid infrastructure, industrial transport, but will also include medical, aerospace, appliances, those types of things, because they have the same market dynamics and behavior as those others.
So – and you can drill down into any one of those sectors and take medical as an example, or literally hundreds, maybe even thousands of different end equipments inside of medical. You could think of a medical imaging system that may sell for millions of dollars down to a blood glucose meter, as an example, that may sell for less than $100 and everything in between.
So just great opportunity and customers in any of those sectors are trying to make their products more efficient, lighter, more precise, more capable, more connected. In any of those vectors, you need semiconductors to be able to do that.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. And then, Dave, how long on the personal electronics – I mean autos and industrial certainly have, I think people have identified with those growth drivers on a multiyear basis. Personal electronics’ last 12 months has been very strong and there is some influence of the pandemic on what’s happened. But how do you think about that kind of last 12 months versus as you look on a longer-term basis, some of the things, some of the key drivers in personal electronics?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, I think, certainly, when you look at personal electronics, you can even see some of those content drivers happening, maybe not to the same degree. But I know, personally, in the last year, we upgraded our TV and some speakers inside of the house, those TVs had Wi-Fi and connectivity inside of them. The speakers were connected and smart speakers that we had in the house. And 10 years ago, those would have been just a paper diaphragm with a magnet attached to them.
So even inside of personal electronics, there’s more content being shipped per system. That will benefit a portfolio that we have. And again, the strength that we saw as we exited the year was very, very broad-based across the portfolio, reflective of some of those trends.
Craig Hettenbach
Got it. All right. I think we’re coming up on the 30-minute time. So I really appreciate spend the time with you both, Rafael and Dave. And thanks everyone else for joining as well.
Rafael Lizardi
Thank you, Craig.
Dave Pahl
Thank you. Have a good day.
Craig Hettenbach
All right. Take care.

Good day everyone and welcome to today's Texas Instruments Q4 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn things over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2020 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI’s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our capital management on February 4 at 10 a.m. Central time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and approach to capital allocation.
For today’s call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. And next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenues results. And as we have done in the past few quarters, we’ll provide details by end market, including sequential performance, since it's more informative at this time. I will also provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insight into the one-time items and our guidance for the first quarter of 2021.
So, starting with a quick overview of the fourth quarter. The company's revenue increased 7% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in automotive, personal electronics and the industrial markets. Analog revenue grew 9%, and Embedded grew 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Analog revenue grew 25% and Embedded grew 14%. Our Other segment grew 4% from a year ago quarter.
Moving on, I'll now provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. First, the automotive market continued its rebound following the second quarter bottom, with 19% sequential growth and 25% year-over-year growth. The industrial market was up 7% sequentially and 16% from the year ago. The strength was seen across most market sectors. Personal electronics was up 11% sequentially and up 39% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across sectors and customers within personal electronics.
Next, as expected, communications equipment was down 28% sequentially and down 8% from the year ago. Enterprise systems was down 2% sequentially and down 13% from the year ago. And lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2020. We break our end markets into six categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The six end markets are industrial, automotive, personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems, and other, which is primarily calculators.
As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 37%, automotive 20%, personal electronics 27%, communications equipment 8%, enterprise systems 6%, and other was 2%. Looking at the changes versus 2019, industrial increased one percentage point, automotive declined 1%, personal electronics increased 4 percentage point, communications equipment declined 3 percentage point, enterprise systems was even, and other declined one percentage point.
In 2020, industrial and automotive combined made up 57% of TI's revenue, about even with last year, and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets.
Rafael, will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.6 billion, or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 230 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, down 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue. For the year, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We’re pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top-line over the long term.
Acquisition charges, a noncash expense, were $47 million in the fourth quarter. Acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021. Operating profit was $1.8 billion, or 44% of revenue. Operating profit was up 45% from the year ago quarter. 
Other income and expense was $162 million in the quarter due to a one-time benefit related to the signing of a multi-year royalty agreement. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.80 per share, which included a $0.16 benefit that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to the royalty agreement we just mentioned.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $212 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $937 million in dividends. We have increased our dividend per share by 13%, marking our 17th year of dividend increases. We repurchased $15 million of our own stock for a total return of cash to owners in the fourth quarter of about $1 billion. For the year 2020, we returned $6 billion, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $6.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $6.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 123, down 21 days from a year ago, and down 14 days sequentially.
Now, let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2020, cash flow from operations was $6.1 billion. Capital expenditures were $649 million, or 4.5% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2020 was $5.5 billion, or 38% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model.
As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. And after accretive investments in the business, the remaining cash will be returned over time via dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 12 months, we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and purchased $2.6 billion of our shares, reducing outstanding share count by 1.4% in 2020.
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.79 billion to $4.11 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.66. We expect our 2021 annual operating tax rate to continue to be about 14% and our effective tax rate about a percentage point lower than that.
In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions.
We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best market opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

2021-01-26,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. David, Rafael, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the current demand backdrop. I mean, clearly, we are hearing about lead time stretching out in the semi industry, many of your peers are talking about raising pricing. I guess, specifically to you guys, can you help us understand what your lead times are doing? What you guys are thinking about doing around pricing? And I guess more importantly, given your inventory strategy and the fact that you ran your fabs a little bit fuller last year, do you think the current results represent your ability to gain some incremental share as some of your peers just are having a harder time supplying customers right now?
Dave Pahl 
Yes, John, let me take – you covered a lot of ground with that first question. So, let me take some pieces of it. Rafael if you want to add anything and if I miss anything, John, we'll give you a chance for the follow-up. But the first one is certainly we've read the same reports, and seeing the same releases from our peers on the supply constraints in raising prices. The short answer – we doing that, the short answer is no. And, I think, that that brings us to one of our foundational competitive advantages is manufacturing and technology, and that really provides two benefits. One, is the obvious, which is lower cost; but the second is greater control of our supply chain. So, it's really times like this and really throughout 2020, that greater control of your supply chains really becomes a great advantage.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, I will just add on the inventory angle of your question, John. Remember our long-term objective for inventory, as we have talked about in many capital management calls is to maintain high levels of customer service, while we minimize inventory obsolescence. Now, part of the reason we can do that is that we are strategically positioned the way we run the company, our business model and competitive advantages where we – our parts are mainly catalog parts that sell into industrial and automotive. Our focus is on those with very long product life cycle, so we can build inventory ahead of demand, we can position that inventory well that served us well in 2020 and will continue to serve us well from a business model standpoint in order to maintain those high levels of customer service with our customers. So, I think, we got most of the pieces, John, you have a follow-up or other pieces we can touch on?
John Pitzer
Yes, just a quick follow-up Rafael. Rafael, I know you don't specifically guide gross margins, but I was wondering if you give us some parameters around OpEx for the next couple of quarters. I mean, we're heading into strong cyclical recovery in revenue off of what was kind of an unusual expense year last year with COVID. And so, as we think about the March quarter, can you help us kind of frame the period costs around SG&A and R&D that we should be thinking about? And if you want to give us a gross margin target, that would be great. But I know you tend to avoid that. 
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, on a gross margin like we have said before, just think of 70% to 75% fall through. So, you figure out what revenue, incremental revenue you want to play in and just follow that through at 70% to 75% and you'll get a good place over the long-term right, any one quarter can be a little higher to the lower, right. 
On OpEx, we talked about we can operate between 20% and 25%. In the last three or four years, we have been between 21% and 22% pretty much, right. So, I don't mean to narrow that phrase, but that's where we've been running and I would expect to stay somewhere in that neighborhood.
Dave Pahl
Between 20% and 25%?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes between 20% and 25%.
Dave Pahl
Right. Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
That will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya
Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the strong growth. Just wanted to follow-up on the demand question. And I'm curious, even if you are able to supply because of your very strong, strategic capacity, do you think your customers, especially on the automotive side, might be constrained with other parts of the bill of materials that they get from others and maybe those become bottlenecks? I'm just trying to reconcile the very strong demand backdrop that we are hearing from your results and your outlook, versus all the news around auto supply chains facing more constraints. What is the true sense of kind of supply and demand across your customer base would be very helpful to hear your views?
Dave Pahl
Sure Vivek. Yes, I think, that's a great question. We see the same reports that you are seeing. And, I think, the best way to maybe describe what we're seeing in the automotive market is a just in time supply chain that's restarting from essentially a full stop that happened in second quarter. And just as a reminder, what we saw in third quarter was a 75% sequential increase followed by this last quarter with a 20% sequential increase. So, what I'll say is, is that those reports are fairly widespread, but we aren't seeing demand signals that would show us that there is anything that's consistent with any of those constraints that you are pointing out or that are in press releases. Do you have a follow on?
Vivek Arya
Yes. Thank you, Dave. Good to see the growth in the Embedded segment and I know you made some changes in that business last year. Do you think we will start to see the benefits of that in 2021, because they also tend to be somewhat stickier markets, so I'm just curious if you could give us an update on what are you doing specifically to regain market share? And do you think we can start to see your Embedded business start to grow in line with your Analog business this year? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Yes. I'll give you a feel on those ones. So first, we're pleased with the progress we're seeing in Embedded. Our plan has called to first stabilize the business and then start to prove that we can resume our long-term consistent growth. We're leveraging our competitive advantages, particularly building a broad-based, a more diverse product portfolio that can then deliver long-term sustainable growth.
I think it was in second quarter of 2020 where we announced, where we had a restructuring charge related to Embedded and we reallocated resources from some product lines, increased investments, some – we decreased other side about the same and we're seeing the beginning of that stabilization on that front. Okay. Thank you for that. Now we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We will hear next from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach
Yes. Thank you. Dave, just following up on your comments around autos, and particularly the just-in-time inventory angle, certainly 2020 was a challenging year for the supply chain and we're dealing with some of those repercussions now. But do you think you'll see some changes to that over time in terms of how they operate from an inventory perspective or something that, it might be difficult for the next couple of quarters, but kind of gets back to that just-in-time?
Dave Pahl
Yes, Craig. I don't want to speak for our customers or how they're managing their inventories. I think as you've seen us and how we've managed our business and our operations. We’ve just worked very hard to try to have capacity in place to support our customer's needs. You saw the decisions that we made earlier in the year to try to keep high service and optionality in place. And we'll just continue to try to support our customer's needs, whatever their supply chains look like so and whether that's in the automotive market or the other market. So we will try to make them happy. That's what we're trying to do. Do you have follow-on?
Craig Hettenbach
I do thanks. And then just looking at Analog up 25% year-over-year, I know that comes off of a difficult year and coming out of a down cycle. And so that's some of it, but just curious at a high-level just to get your thoughts of just the type of strength you're seeing and how you feel about what the demand is out there?
Dave Pahl
Can you clarify that a little bit for me, Craig? Just so I make sure I answer the right question.
Craig Hettenbach
Yes. So just with the Analog business up 25% year-over-year, that's coming off of an easy comp, if you will, coming out of the down cycle, so I think that's some of it. But just curious, I know in some of these calls you talked about just your view of just, our supply and demand equilibrium, or how you feel like demand is relative to how your businesses is trending right now?
Dave Pahl
Well. Yes. I think that when you look at where that business is, I think that we've just come through a – from a cyclical indicators and those types of things. You'd even have to go back to 2018 when the industry had reached the cyclical peak then you throw-in, sprinkle on top. COVID-19 and it was really at the beginning of -- or at the end of last year, the beginning of 2020 that we had begun to seeing signs of stabilization before COVID had hit.
So, inventories really weren't a problem at that point in time. And we had said at that point in time that our shipments were beginning to reflect what customers were beginning to ship overall. So again, I think that what we are shipping today is reflective of what customers are asking us to ship. We have a good availability of product, because of the decisions that we've made. And our lead-times have remained stable. That doesn't mean, of course that we don't have hotspots that we're working. And we always have hotspots, but that's kind of where we are today.
Thank you, Craig. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We will hear next from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong execution. Amidst the strong demand environment, as we all know, foundry capacity is pretty tight both leading edge and lagging edge. And I know that TI outsources about 20% of its wafer requirements most of it with your embedded products, MPUs, MCUs. So because of the foundry tightness, is the team also somewhat constrained on your Embedded products either Q4 or here in Q1 and also the same thing from an assembly and test perspective, or I think about 40% of your assembly and test requirements are outsourced to the sub-cost. Is this constraining, maybe some of your shipments near term?
Dave Pahl
At a high-level, we have long-term agreements with these suppliers like we do with other suppliers. Even though we only outsource relatively small part of our loadings. We're still being a big company that’s still a good amount of loadings raise. So we still get some decent leverage. So we're seeing some hotspots here and there, but to the largest degree we're getting what we need.
Harlan Sur
Yes.
Rafael Lizardi
And I would say, having 80% of our wafer sourced internally, almost all of our analogs sourced internally and that is a great advantage for us. So overall, as we've talked about the lead times, lead times have remained stable. So that has been a huge advantage for us. Do you have a follow-on Harlan?
Harlan Sur
Yes, absolutely. Yes. Thanks for the insights there. Can you guys just provide us with the shipment trends quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year by geography? I know it's shipped to location, but I think it's still useful to kind of understand the breadth of the overall demand profile you guys are seeing ?
Rafael Lizardi
Sure. So, in the quarter and thank you for the preamble there, so I won't repeat it. But year ago, Asia was up and all of the other regions were either flat or down and sequentially all the regions except for the U.S. were up. And just as another point of color on where we ship our products, 90% of our revenues come from shipments outside of the U.S. and we've got about 20% of our revenues that are based by customers in China. So just a little bit more color on the comment that you made there earlier.
So thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We’ll hear now from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. Rafael, I guess I asked this question last quarter too, but you, again bought back next to no stock, and I totally get that you were running a -- kind of a plan in the first half, and you were certainly a head of the 100% for the full-year, but you also have a pretty strong intrinsic value model for the share repo and you were pretty good at buying back the stock. So I guess maybe I'll ask you again to just sort of comment on that. Is there anything that we can read into that, given that it's the second quarter in a row?
Rafael Lizardi
You know, what I would tell you is that as we talk about doing capital management, our goal is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We generated in 2020; $5.5 billion of free cash flow and we generated $6 billion of free cash flow, so clearly well above the cash flow generation. So following...
Timothy Arcuri
Okay. And then I guess, yes, yes, yes, I do. I guess, can you give us an update on the 300 millimeter, the new FAB and sort of the timing around that, and I guess on that, can you qualify for some of these subsidies coming from the government or is that mostly going to be leading edge? Things.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, sure. So the update on the factory is the same, nothing has changed as far as our expectation. The new factory is being built. We expected to be completed in 2022; so next year. In fact, we should have some form – some level of output in the second half of next year. So that's all going in as per plane. When it's fully equipped, it has the potential for revenue of about $5 billion per year.
On your question on the incentives that a lot of that remains to be seen, there are two legislations, one, one that was approved, but was not funded; another one hasn't been approved. The chips, I think is the one that hasn't been approved, but the one that was approved was not even funded, so – and there's a lot of uncertainties on that depending on how that comes out. So when that comes out, we'll look at it and we'll decide if it makes sense for us.
But the biggest or the highest level we think semi-conductor is a foundational technology and anything that the government can do to strengthen that and to keep us at a level playing field companies in the United States versus other countries that would be a good.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Tim. And I think we've got time for one more caller, please.
Operator
That will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg
Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results. First question for Rafael, I typically wouldn't ask you this because I know you get a lot of these, but the royalty this quarter was pretty material $162 million. Can you maybe add any color on that and should we expect sizeable things like that going forward as well?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So it was about, inside that $162 million, it was more – most of that $162 million and we recognize it based on accounting rules. The cash actually comes in, not quite like that. It comes in over time, but it's just – it's a licensing agreement. We've had those for many years. They have become the minimums in the – at the highest level, frankly. So I don't expect that to change from a cash standpoint is about $100 million a year. So from the revenue or the income recognition standpoint, sometimes they come in as pops as what you saw, but they've passed, which is really what matters is more stable than that. And again, like I said, it's about $100 million a year and I don't expect that to change much.
Dave Pahl
Yes, follow-on Tore?
Tore Svanberg
Yes. Thank you, Dave. So I know your long-term goal is to grow CapEx at 6% – well to spend 6% of your revenues and CapEx. I think last year you said it was 4.5%; was there sort of any COVID related issues that slowed things down? And as we look at 2021, do you think it will come in close to that, that, that range sort of 6%?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So I'll go ahead and take that. So, yes, our guidance is 6%. Our guidance continues to be 6% CapEx has presented revenue. That's a long-term guidance includes everything that goes into CapEx as far as building and equipment. Now of course that number can fluctuate, right? Like you pointed out, it just – it just fluctuated down in 2020 to 4.5%. So I wouldn't be surprised if it is a little higher than 6% for a year or two, but for your models I would suggest you stick with 6% out into the future. It's just – it's simpler that way, and it gets the point across.
Tore Svanberg
Okay. Thank you so much.
Rafael Lizardi
Thank you, Tore.
Dave Pahl
That concludes the call. So let me finish with a few comments and key items that we believe deeply. First, we run the company with the mindset of being a long-term owner. We believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. Our ambitions and values are integral to how we built TI stronger. When we're successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities, and shareholders, all win.
Okay. And thank you all for joining us. The replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening.
Operator
And again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining us.

John Pitzer
Good morning. Why don't we go ahead and get started. I'd like to introduce -- welcome everyone to this morning's session with Texas Instruments. It's my distinct pleasure to introduce Rich Templeton, the Chairman, President and CEO of Texas Instruments. We've got about 30 minutes in this forum, the fireside chat. If you have any questions, please e-mail them to me, and I will try to work them in to my prepared questions.
But with that, I want to welcome, Rich, and thank him.
"
2020-12-02,Q&A," Session
Q - John Pitzer
Rich, I told you this before, these fireside chats with you are terrifying to me; one, because it's you; and two, because of the consistency of your business, it's really difficult to come up with new and original questions that haven't already been asked. But I always like to start off these fireside chats by giving you the opportunity to kind of set the table, kind of review for us again, kind of the core strategy of the Company. And what do you think the key investment proposition is? Our value proposition is for your owners that are listening in right now?
Rich Templeton
John thanks. And we do take great pride in trying to keep things boring because I think there's great benefit and returns, if you can be consistent on that front. But in many ways, I think the assumption or where we've been driving the Company really rotates around just a couple of things.
First is, we just look at where the world wants to go in terms of more electronics, making products better. And that's lower power, easier to use, more efficient and the various things. And in order to do that, you've got to put electronics and therefore semiconductors inside of them. And we just look at embedded and analog semiconductors as the best products to be in across the market. We've got the added opinion that we've been pretty consistent with this, that the automotive and the industrial markets, while we love all our markets, and they're all great businesses for us. They're going to have average up growth over the next 10 years.
And then finally, I think it just rotates around this belief that free cash flow per share is really the best proxy to drive value over the long term. And as a result, we really try to be very disciplined about the competitive advantages of the business model that we have, helping to drive that free cash flow per share. And we just try to stay very focused when we invest money in those areas either strengthen them or to leverage them accordingly. So, if that sounds vaguely familiar to what you've heard from us for the past 10 years, then that's probably a pretty good thing.
John Pitzer
And consistency is good. Rich, one of the things I've always admired about you and your organization, is the fact that you look at numbers, you're very data-driven. You look at historical trends and you kind of call things as you see them. You don't try to shape color shape that with one direction or the other. I'd just be kind of curious, given that you are sort of a student of the industry. How do you think about where we are in the cycle? And I know that, that's not something that you focus too heavily on to run the business. But I'd be curious about kind of your perspective of where the semiconductor is, both cyclically, but perhaps more importantly, structurally?
Rich Templeton
Yes. So John, I guess just a couple of things and you can follow up on some of the structural questions. But -- and I think you've been on this thesis as the world moved into COVID-19 back in, you can say, January or to the March time frame, depending on where you are in the world.
As you somewhat implied with your question, we took a close look at the last big economic disruption, and we said the wise choice to navigate 2020 was to stay aggressive with the operating plan because you've just got to be in a position to produce things even though customers won't be able to forecast very well.
And I think that choice ended up really helping us. I think you've had the added theory, and I believe it is a very fair one that a lot of people underestimated that 2019 was already a down year compared to '17 and '18. So as a result, there wasn't much flex for the semiconductor industry to absorb in 2020. And I think you've seen it pretty much play out that way over time.
Now to the question of longer term, I think that there's some interesting insights that you can potentially arrive at, and I'm sure you have an opinion on these. But I think you're seeing, for example, the impact of when you have control of your manufacturing internally, and you've got a robust business continuity plan, you can just do a better job for your customers.
And we just think that, that is going to be a growing advantage over not just the next year but the next 10 years. So these things that you hear us talking about of investing to expand manufacturing and technology as an advantage or building out and taking advantage of the reach of our sales channels.
These are all structural advantages that I think are going to play in our favor over the long term.
John Pitzer
Well, Rich, I actually argue that they've been benefiting you here in the near-term as well. Our checks clearly show that you're the one guy out there that continues to have good availability of parts, and it's probably helped some of your near-term business, but I couldn't agree with you more about the longer term. I don't know I want to stay on kind of the cyclical recovery basis because you had very strong growth in your September quarter. I think it was -- but it was the first time, I think, in multiple quarters, that you actually saw year-over-year growth.
And to your point that you highlighted, '19 was a down year for both analog and embedded for the SIA data. It looks like despite what's a better than feared year this year, analog and embedded are still going to be flat to slightly down year-over-year for the full year calendar year '20. I would argue that down on down bodes pretty well for next year, but how are you seeing it?
Rich Templeton
I'm always careful on WSTs only because we've got to get the year done, and I also like to triangulate to the companies themselves. But I think it's pretty consistent when you look at the bottoms-up company performance for the numbers you just described. I think what 2020 probably reflects and John, you're close to this. It's really that where the COVID mix has driven consumption.
And so, we've seen a stronger growth in the computing market be it work from home, learn from home. Those things have obviously benefited. The automotive market lost, one could argue 2.5 or three months with plant shutdowns in North America and Europe. So that's going to tend to average that down a little bit.
So I think those are examples of contributors of why the total market could be up versus analog and embedded. But I do agree that I think the indications of where analog and embedded can continue to grow are going to be -- should be reasonably positive.
John Pitzer
Rich, one of the Company-specific questions I get often about you guys is just what seems to have been -- or is the divergence in sort of trajectory between your core analog business and your core embedded business with embedded kind of underperforming here. I'm wondering if you could help us walk through what you think are the dynamics that are driving that. And more importantly, kind of the outlook for embedded kind of closing that relative growth gap with your analog business?
Rich Templeton
Yes. John, I think you're kind to use the word kind of as an adjective in front of embedded because I think we've been very clear, we're not pleased with the performance that we've seen during 2018 and '19. It's why we've made changes. It's why we've really taken a sharper look, and we've done some things internally on that front.
And I think that Dave and Rafael even talked during the October call, and we're very careful with stuff like this. But basically, when you look at the data that you saw with embedded in the third quarter signs of stabilization, and the only reason we're careful with describing it that way is we really want to get this to where embedded is back growing and contributing at the level it did for a very long period of time up until 2017.
The business is capable of doing that. We've had to make some changes. That's ours. We are going to get that fixed then, but it's going to take a little bit of time before we can start to get the consistency of growth back out of that. So that's where our efforts are, and we're pretty focused on that.
John Pitzer
Well, Rich, can you help me understand the design cycles in the embedded business versus analog? I mean, I think one of the great strengths of your overall business is that you play in end markets that have design cycles that can be three-plus years. And once you get that socket, you sort of got recurring revenue for 7 to 10 years. Is embedded a relatively shorter duration market than analog, so that new design wins can flow into the business model more quickly? Or is it about the same?
Rich Templeton
It is it's the easiest and simplest assumption, John, is that it's about the same. It can obviously vary a little bit depending on if you've got exposure to an automotive market versus industrial or which areas that you have industrial, but to the source of your question or to the intent of your question, assume it's the same.
And that's also why we're just careful with step one and signs of stabilization, then we've got to continue that. But you really have to give it a couple of years to make sure that you've got the sustainable growth back and running again just because of the time constants that you referenced.
John Pitzer
The other dynamic that I think has added a little bit of noise to what's already been a very noisy year in your business. It's just some of the decisions you've made around your distribution strategy. I'm wondering if you could just level set us on kind of the strategy. But more importantly, the impact you think that some of your decisions might have had on growth over the last couple of quarters and what that might mean for growth in coming quarters?
Rich Templeton
Yes. So John, I'd break it into a couple of things. First, go to the higher level strategic objective because I really do think that this is going to be one of these topics that when we're talking two, three, four and five years from now, there's a pretty good chance we're going to look back and say, that was really a pivotal change that we put in place and that it's really becoming an enormous advantage for us driving growth for the long term.
And it's because we just simply believe that if you look at a secular trend, customers have a growing desire for the convenience and the productivity that comes from content and commerce, being able to take place online. And yes, complemented with technical and commercial skilled people. But that's just the direction that the world wants to go, it's how design engineers want to work. It's how customers want to work.
And so when we sit back and look at where the world wants to go and we've been on this path, as you know, for a while, that calls for having close direct relationships with customers, not having people or distributors in between you and those customers. And it is going to be -- it's going to have a profound impact because you just see more, you know more. And as a result, you have better access to be able to win more business because it's not filtered or not flowing through other organizations.
And so we've been moving in that direction for a long period of time, taking out design win registrations and things like that. And 2020 is really the final year as we're narrowing down the distributor count and shifting quite a bit of business to direct. And yes, as you noted. I think we've been draining distributor-owned inventory for eight straight quarters. So that obviously creates a quote revenue headwind, but it doesn't change your real share at the point of consumption.
And you'll certainly get that back when that draining of inventory stops because it's depleted, which we're coming up on. And we really believe those are the classic make the right decisions for the long term even though it may have a bit of a headwind in the short term. But our team is already excited the data -- what they're starting to see and learn and what we're able to do with customers is really pretty exciting for us.
John Pitzer
As you pointed out, I think the big advantage you have is scale. And one of the ways that's materialized is what you've done with the Internet and your website. You're sort of the Amazon of the analog space. I'm wondering, if you could just give us an update on the strategy? And how important that is becoming for procurement of future business?
Rich Templeton
John, it is, back to your point of scale. It's not just the website, but it's also the investments we've made in application engineers and technical salespeople, it's investments that we've made on internal processes. So that we can work on a seamless basis where the web and direct touch with customers is one and the same, we've had huge upside even in 2020.
We had made investments and done work back in 2016, building a, what was called mass market selling or virtual selling that was targeted, how we got deeper into the marketplace. But we would do it in a virtual way on the web. And then all of a sudden, this thing called COVID-19 hit in March. And we had the entire sales force already trained on virtual selling. So it was a seamless switch in terms of how they were going to operate on that front.
So those investments are all part of that, and the benefit that we have is we literally have tens of millions of visits to ti.com, more than even our closest competitors in analog because we simply have a larger portfolio of products.
And as a result, if you're a design engineer, you're going to have book mark, and you're going to go to the websites that give the highest probability that we're going to have a part that solves your needs when you begin a design. And that is just a great advantage to have as really a combination of first mover, investing in this way, but also the advantage of -- it's a hard thing for somebody to replicate the breadth of what we have.
John Pitzer
An additional source of noise to the business over the last couple of years has been sort of U.S.-China trade tension, specifically around Huawei. I'm just kind of curious Rich, if you can give us your perspective, and how you're thinking about navigating through the regulatory trade environment over the next couple of years. But more importantly, when you think about China's desire for domestic independence on the semiconductor side? And what that might mean for your competitive position in China against domestic Chinese in both the embedded and the analog business?
Rich Templeton
Yes, so just a couple of things quickly on that, John. First off is, the ambitions of China to build a domiciled semiconductor industry and independent of the world. As you know, you can go back 30 years of five-year plans and find that ambition called out. And so this is not a new ambition. It's not a new effort. It's certainly got more money behind it now, and it certainly has the amplification, as you noted, of the U.S.-China trade tensions that we've seen in the past couple of years. So, the effort isn't new.
And the second thing is that, again, as you know quite well, a lot of that investment tends to get aimed at the big -- call them, big shiny objects or big identifiable segments of the marketplace. So a lot of investment in memory or trying to get into advanced logic for processors or app processors or modems or things along those lines. So markets like analog are understood. They're just a lot harder to mobilize on because it's about developing tens of thousands of products, and it's about having global channels to be able to sell those products on a global basis to be able to make the economics work.
So I just think you've got to comprehend all that when you think about what that risk looks like. We still have this fundamental belief that China is more opportunity than threat. If you've got better product offerings, better product capabilities, availability, pricing, convenience, those are going to win business in China because the customers are going to be ultimately pragmatic on trying to develop and ship the best product. Obviously, on the regulatory things, if we have those come up like with Huawei, it's just simple. You abide by the regulations and you don't ship if that occurs, and you just deal with those things.
John Pitzer
Now that makes a lot of sense. I want to take you back, Rich, to 2011. Back then, we had a target on the stocks of 500 and people thought we were crazy. It was also the year that people thought you were crazy that you bid up National, I think about 80% and bought them for what was, I believe, $6.5 billion.
That looks like change in Alpine in your accounts relative to some of the M&A that's been going on in the space of late. I'd like to get kind of your perspective of how you see the M&A environment for semi? And then is M&A still something that you think is a good tool for you to use? Or do you still see that purchasing your own stock is a better return on your investment?
Rich Templeton
Yes. So message inside of that, okay, you lived through it and watched it with us. And it was really actions we took in 2009, '10 and '11. National being the 2011 decision, as you mentioned. But we also saw 2009 and '10, a great time to buy assets and that we bought, used equipment from Qimonda or a couple of wafer fabs that we were able to get at extraordinary prices at that time.
As you noted on National, besides the absolute value, that sounds pretty low, I forget the exact number, but I think free cash flow that National generated was like 6% of purchase price even with the premium. And I just still think that those principles have to hold. So fast forward, nine years ahead on that, I think M&A has a clear role that it can play. But as with all capital allocation decision, you got to begin with a comment of it depends.
And you just -- you've got to be disciplined on where that money goes and what type of returns you can get on it. Now we do have a luxury as several of your questions this morning have highlighted, which is we've got ourselves prepared and on the right side of the critical mass line or the right side of the scale line in terms of manufacturing, in terms of product breadth, in terms of reach of the channel. So it's not like that we have to go do things from an M&A point of view because we don't have a choice in order to achieve scale, which I think is a wonderful place for us to be in. So as a result, yes, we'll just -- we'll continue to be disciplined.
John Pitzer
Well, staying on the capital deployment side of things, I got questions around two other uses of your capital, which is R&D and CapEx. I think, first, on the R&D side. I think one of the benefits you have in your business model is that as you steer more towards industrial and auto, those are longer duration assets that you can really leverage R&D dollars over a longer period of time, which should eventually lead to an overall R&D burden as a percent of revenue that still has a downward trajectory. I know that's not how you think about making R&D investments, but help me understand better that dynamic and how we on Wall Street should be thinking about the R&D expenditures?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I think, John, the way I would talk on R&D is that it typically gets shorthanded and focused on as a percent of revenue. And I get that because it's how the quick math on a P&L model would work. But our belief in general is that we have an opportunity to continue to grow that R&D. Your comments are 100% correct, which is the beauty about even my opening comments about where we want to invest.
One of the competitive advantages we talk about is diversity and longevity. When we make investments, be it in a part, be it in a process technology, be it in a piece of manufacturing equipment or a design win. And if they can live for 20, 30 or 40 years, it's obvious what the return on investments are going to look like. So we think there's opportunity in a very steady, consistent way to continue to grow R&D, keep developing great products and great technologies.
And in any one year, that percent may go up or down depending on what the revenue is doing in that year, but just like I advised on the April earnings call when COVID was going to potentially take revenue down, we were going to have a very steady hand on R&D investments because those are 5 and 10 year calls, not something to get distracted on in the near term. So we will keep growing that. I don't want to imply that the percent of R&D is going to come down over time.
I think we operate at a very efficient level, as you know, compared to the industry right now. And I don't think we've got to go squeeze that further, developing great parts, generate great return, and that's where we'll focus.
John Pitzer
And then, Rich, on the CapEx front, as you pointed out earlier, you did a great job, buying capacity cheaply back in the sort of '08, '09 time period. I'm kind of curious if you can give us an update on sort of the build-out of the second shale within our fab and kind of how we should think about you balancing CapEx dollars today versus future revenue growth?
Rich Templeton
Yes. John, again, I think, if I remember, I think I mentioned the same comment in April, both R&D as well as CapEx, and that is that we're going to keep a steady hand looking 5 and 10 years out R&D, and we're going to do the same with CapEx. And in the case of CapEx, we're going to have a particular focus on what 2022 and through 2025 needs to look like. And so the investments that we're making in our third 300-millimeter facility, our fab two, as you noted that's really about revenue two and three years from now and then that kind of four-year period from 2022 forward. And so construction is underway. Good progress is being made.
We had commented, I think it was the capital management call last February that a 6% type revenue assumption is a reasonable assumption to look at over the longer term. I would not try to be overly precise with what that number would be in any year. Because revenue could be up or down, it could move that around. That 6%, as you know, is up from, I think we ran 4% for a seven, eight or nine-year period, just because we had a higher percent of used equipment. And we've made the assumption with that six that there'll be a higher percent of new equipment inside of there.
We just think that's a wiser -- wiser prediction to make at this particular point. So that's the road map that we'll execute to. As I commented earlier, I think, in a world where, in fact probably gravity has more people outsourcing wafers or outsourcing, assembly manufacturing. We actually believe this is going to be a growing advantage over the next 10 years, both in terms of the cost advantage it gives us, but also the control of supply chain that it gives us.
John Pitzer
Well, Rich, a lot of this conversation has centered on rightfully your scale advantage. You and I have talked about this in the past. When you look at the analog market overall, it's one of those markets in semis that doesn't seem to -- on the surface, need to ask you. You're the largest guy in the space at sort of a 20% market share, but I always joke that the other guy, that other guy that's other that has more share than you.
I've asked this question from time to time, and I'll ask it again. Are you seeing a drive by customers to want to deal with fewer suppliers who can do more in the analog space? And do you ultimately believe that should lead to faster than historic share gains for you? And I'm especially interested in that dynamic within the auto industry.
Rich Templeton
Yes. John, I think my careful answer, and I want to be kind of precise with this is if you try to go to a question is one stop shopping, a benefit that a design engineer selecting analog components looks for. I don't believe that, that is the case. Meaning that whoever, a mass is a bunch of stuff wins more business. If you look at where we spend our time and the things that we do, you've got to make it easy and convenient, okay, that design engineers can find what they're looking for, be able to evaluate it, easily test it and then get it into production. And if you do that well, you can make scale an advantage, I hope that makes sense in describing it that way.
Because of a smaller fabless analog competitor, does those a good part and gets to the customers, they're going to design it in. It's just the beauty of the business on that front. So if you think about the points of scale that we take advantage of, I don't believe our analog competitors are going to build 300-millimeter manufacturing because they just don't have the revenue size, let alone the experience to go do that. They don't have the revenue size to have the package varieties that they would have to have.
So as a result, they outsource their assembly. They don't have the revenue size, so they can't have the applications, sales teams or the investments in ti.com, online commerce or make the investments in processes to make that all work together internally. So, you've got, it is scale that enables it, but you've got to turn it into something that's highly valued by the customer to make it really work.
John Pitzer
Rich, we're coming up to the end of time in the session, but I wanted to end with one final question. I know that you've always prided yourself on the bed strength inside the organization. I think earlier this year, you sort of reinstated the COO role. I'm wondering if you could spend just a few minutes just talking about succession and how we on Wall Street should be thinking about that.
Rich Templeton
Yes. John, it's one of these things when in 2018, when I came back from my short sabbatical, I know you and many others asked what the time frame was, and I said it's really pretty simple. And that is it will be, however long that it takes to have a great leader that can give us another 10 or 15-year shift and love the technology, love the people, love the work that I get to do, but that's really where we're heading.
And the other thing and again, you've had the chance to meet a lot of people at TI over the years. The other thing that, one is the fun part about what I get to do, but more importantly, for confidence to investors is just look at the caliber of leaders that we have, if you keep meeting that next level down over the past 10 and 15 years.
And so, when we had the opportunity to promote Haviv to the COO role, he is just a terrific leader, okay in terms of his technical capability, his urgency, his competitiveness, his thoughtfulness all the things that you'd want in a great leader.
And equally important, and you've not -- and investors haven't had a chance to get down to Dallas recently, but the team that he's got reporting into him and the team that's underneath that, they keep getting better year after year as well just because we've had people growing up inside of the system, and they keep getting better at it.
So I couldn't be more pleased with what the lineup looks like and what -- I think the inevitable support that we've got in terms of a great team that knows where we're trying to go, really lives the strategy, live the values that really represent TI. And so I think we're in a very strong position on that front.
John Pitzer
Perfect. Rich, with that, I really appreciate the conversation this morning, as always, very insightful. I want to thank you and everyone who joined us virtually.
I also want to pass along our wishes that you, your immediate family and as importantly, the larger TI family continues to stay safe and healthy in what's been a very challenging 2020.
Rich Templeton
John, thank you, and saying back to your entire team and everybody else out there. Hopefully, the miracles of vaccine in the pharma industry are going to get us back to some semblance of normal, and we all look forward to that.
John Pitzer
Thank you.
Rich Templeton
Okay, John. Have a good day.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments 3Q 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is now [ph] being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and will provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter; next, I'll provide insight into the third quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end market, including some sequential performance since it's more informative at this time; and then lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, capital management, and our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020.
Let me start with a quick overview with three key points. Revenue was higher than expected and grew 18% sequentially, with notable strength from the rebound of automotive and growing demand from personal electronics. Revenue increased 1% from the same quarter a year ago.
In April and again in July, we explained we would maintain high optionality with our operating plan so we could support customers, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast will be limited. This approach has served us and our customers well and we'll continue this posture in the fourth quarter.
Finally, while visibility for the near-term demand has improved, we remain cautious as the broader economic impact of the global pandemic could continue for several years.
Our approach in an environment like this is to maintain high optionality with our operating plan in the short term, to continue critical investments in R&D and in new capabilities like those for ti.com, and finally, to invest to ensure long-term manufacturing capacity, particularly for the 2022 to 2025 timeframe.
We've made these decisions with our overall ambitions in mind, which include running the company with the mindset of a long-term owner. These decisions have continued to serve us well.
Looking at our segments, Analog grew 18% and Embedded Processing grew 19% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Analog grew 7% and Embedded Processing declined 10%. Our Other segment declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to lower calculator sales or COVID-19 impacted back-to-school sales.
Moving on, I'll now provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by end market. First, the automotive market rebounded with about 75% sequential growth and returned to levels similar to a year ago. Revenue has grown from the bottom we saw in May as North American and European automotive assembly plants resumed operations.
Next, the industrial market was down low single-digits sequentially, roughly a sequential decline and about even from a year ago. Not surprisingly, there were areas of strength and there were areas of weakness. The diversity within industrial results in relative stability, reinforcing the attractiveness of this highly diverse market.
Personal electronics was up more than 20% sequentially and up about 15% compared to a year ago. The strength was broad-based across personal electronics, combined with TI being in a position to support unforecasted demand in the third quarter.
Next, comms equipment was down about mid-single-digits sequentially and up mid-single-digits from a year ago and enterprise systems was down both comparisons.
Lastly, I'll note a housekeeping item. We've simplified our Analog business structure into our power business and our signal chain business. Starting this quarter, our reporting will reflect these changes.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $3.8 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.5 billion, or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin decreased 60 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $793 million, up 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D.
Operating profit was $1.6 billion in the quarter, or 42% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $1.4 billion, or $1.45 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $146 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.2 billion.
In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 13%, marking our 17th consecutive year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we paid $825 million in dividends and repurchased $15 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $6.4 billion in the past 12 months, or 123% of free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 64% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were down $64 million from the prior quarter, and days were 137. Distribution-owned inventory declined in the third quarter by about $100 million, the eighth consecutive quarter of planned reductions, as we have continued the transition to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct.
As a reminder, as we build closer, direct relationships with our customers, we further strengthened one of our competitive advantages, the reach of our market channels. Tactically and strategically, we are pleased with the progress of the transition and the impact for our customers.
For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.41 billion to $3.69 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.40. Our annual operating tax rate has not changed much, but now rounds up to 14% for the year, and that's what you should use for your models in the fourth quarter. For next year, we expect our annual operating tax rate to remain at about 14%.
In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
"
2020-10-20,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
Hi, guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Rafael, Dave, my first question is on automotive. You guys saw very strong results in the September quarter. I think you spoke to a 75% sequential increase in revenue in the automotive end market. What's your view on December as it relates to automotive? And how are you thinking about sustainability into the early part of 2021? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Dave Pahl
Sure, Toshiya. Yes, I think that, that 75% sequential obviously was very strong, but it's probably best explained at looking at the previous quarter. And as we talked about last quarter, the majority of the automotive revenue is on consignment.
So as the North American and European manufacturers had closed plants, that revenue reacted very quickly and we were down 40% sequentially and year-on-year, and so as those factories opened up, we saw the bottom in May. And we expected revenue to grow, and as they opened up, obviously, that revenue reacted very quickly in the other direction. So that's really the story that we saw in third quarter.
Again, as we've given color last quarter on the automotive market and talked about how that was moving pretty significantly in the fourth quarter, we're not breaking out any particular end market or specific color on that front. So there's not a reason to as we look into the fourth quarter. So, you have a follow-on?
Toshiya Hari
I do. Thanks, Dave. My follow-up question is on gross margins in Q3. Rafael, you mentioned that gross margins were down 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And I was just trying to better understand what the puts and takes were. Overall revenue, I think, was up 1%. Your mix of businesses improved with Analog up 7% year-over-year, embedded processing down 10%. And 12-inch versus eight, and so I'm guessing, 12-inch was up year-over-year.
So I'm just trying to understand what the negatives were on a year-over-year basis that drove gross margins down a little bit. But I appreciate you guys don't run your business for gross margin, but just curious. Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, no, happy to answer that. So yeah, on a year-on-year basis, revenue was up 1%. Gross margin dollars were up, but a little less than that, maybe 0.5% or so. So -- but when you're looking at such a big number that then the delta is so small, it's difficult to look at the pull-through like we normally look at it, right?
So in the big scheme of things, revenue was up a little bit and gross margin dollars were up a little bit. But having said that, I would also point out that the mix of personal electronics revenue was higher in third quarter than it's been what it was the same quarter last year or even second quarter.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thanks, Toshiya. And we’ll go to next caller please.

We'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach
Yes, thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on the last point on the strength in personal electronics. Really, as you look out to Q4, Dave, how do you feel about inventory versus end demand sell-through? And then as part of that and perhaps other segments as well, how you think about Huawei in terms of perhaps last shipments there and how you're seeing that as you go forward?
Rafael Lizardi
Let me go ahead and start, and then Dave can address the Huawei question or anything else. But at the highest level, we are very well-positioned to handle whatever comes at us, whether it's personal electronics or any other market. But personal electronics is one that by having the inventory strategy that we have followed, having that optionality that we have talked about for now, 180 days or so, the last two quarterly releases has put us in a really, really good position.
Now that is not just having that kind of tactical strategy, it's also -- or tactical position. It's also having the strategic position of being the supplier of catalog parts that are highly diversified, that sell to many, many customers. We have over 100,000 different customers, sell 80,000 different parts. So it put us in a position where we can build the inventory, have the asymmetric bet, so that if our revenue's strong, we can support it. If it's not, then we hold inventory a little longer than usual. But that's okay, it's just a little working capital.
With that, I also want to make the point that inventory, we think, very -- it's a strategic asset. As we have talked about earlier, we're comfortable holding high levels of inventory. And in fact, we're going to update, we're going to give you an update on our range on inventory at the next capital management call in February. Dave?
Dave Pahl
Sure. Yeah, I'll make the comment on Huawei. So Huawei was about 2% of our revenue in the third quarter. That was a little higher than what they were in the first half of 2020. So certainly we're in compliance with U.S. export restrictions and stopped shipping to them on September 14th, and they are not included in our fourth quarter revenue guidance. So do you have a follow-on, Craig?
Craig Hettenbach
Sure. No, thanks for all the color there. I guess, just how you think about as the business rebounds, just from an OpEx perspective, any puts and takes there for Q4 and into next year?
Rafael Lizardi
Nothing significant that I would point to. In OpEx, of course, R&D is a big part of that. It's about $1.5 billion a year. That's a big component of our competitive advantage of having the broadest portfolio in the industry. We continue to put out some of the best products, catalog products that go into automotive, industrial, personal electronics, communication market. So, we'll continue to strengthen that advantage.
Another one that goes in OpEx in the G&A portion -- in the SG&A portion is the investment that we're making in ti.com to strengthen the reach of our channels. So, we continue to strengthen that tool, that ability to reach channels, reach customers better and keeping them engaged longer and selling more and more products to those customers.
So at the highest level, OpEx has been running $3.1 billion, $3.2 billion a year on a trailing 12-month basis. I would expect for that to run at above that level, maybe over time up 1% or 2% year-on-year, but in that neighborhood.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thank you. And we’ll go to the next caller please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one, I wanted to touch on the strength from PE. I wanted to know, if you can give us a little more color on how much of that would be PCs versus smartphones? I know that you had talked about some of that strength coming from your ability to satisfy unexpected demand. I assume that was maybe more a PC statement, but any color you could give us on sort of the relative mix and growth of those two sub-end markets would be helpful.
Dave Pahl
Yes, Stacy, I'd say that as the pandemic first started back in March and even in last quarter, a lot of the strength was initially driven by PCs and tablets. But we have seen that strength broaden, so even to TVs and smart speakers and other things that are used in the home. So, our best estimate or guesstimate of what's going on is that as people are spending more time at home, they're upgrading the things that they're using more. So, that spend is broadening beyond just the PC. And as Rafael was talking about, our portfolio of products serves us well and puts us in a position to be able to support that demand. Do you have a follow-on?
Stacy Rasgon
I do. Thank you. So I know, you're talking about continuing to hold high inventory levels and maintaining high service into Q4 and beyond, and I get that. I just want to know if you could give us any color on what that implies for your utilization and loading going forward. I'm assuming your utilization was up sequentially in Q2 -- in Q3, I mean. Please let us know if that was the case? And what are your plans for utilization, factory loadings as we go into Q4 and the end of the year?
Rafael Lizardi
Sure. So Stacy, as you know, we only talk about utilization when there's a big inflection point or something unusual. So we did talk about it in April going into second quarter because most people -- most other vertical competitors decreased their loading. And instead, we kept them flat at that point to first quarter to maintain that option, to have that optionality that frankly has served us tremendously well during these last six months.
Since second quarter, we have biased up our loadings, so we did that from second to third, a little higher. And third and going to fourth, we'll probably bias that up -- we are biasing that up higher. It's nothing significant. But it is biased up, so that we maintain that optionality and we can maximize revenue and support our customers with any potential upsides that they have that are -- also, that would be unsupported otherwise.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Stacy. We’ll go to the next caller please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. I guess my first question is on the share buyback. It was quite small, even lower than in the depths of the financial crisis back in 2008. Yet your business has already snapped back a lot. What's the thinking there? You've always been pretty astute about the intrinsic value of your stock, so how should investors sort of read that? Thanks.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. No, first, let me step back and remind everybody how we think about cash returns. And we talk about this during capital management every year in February and when we meet with investors. But when we think about cash returns, the objective there is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company via buybacks and dividends. We use both.
And if you look at in the last -- on a trailing 12-month basis, which is the best way to look at that, we have generated $5.2 billion of free cash flow and have returned $6.4 billion. So $1.2 billion more than the generation, so well ahead of the generation, the return has been. Do you have a follow-up?
Timothy Arcuri
I did, I did. So I wanted to double-click just a little bit on the drop-through in Analog. It seemed like the drop-through in embedded was fine, but you're still a little below where the op margin was back in sort of the late 2018 time frame at sort of similar levels. Is there something going on with mix? Is that maybe the PE mix that you were talking about before within Analog? Thanks.
Rafael Lizardi
There's nothing unusual there to comment. Clearly, analog is the biggest segment that we have. So anything that we would comment at the company level applies -- likely came from analog. And they have a fair amount of PE impact, a disproportionate amount of personal electronics, given that embedded doesn't have much personal electronics, so yes.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Yes. And embedded is essentially industrial and automotive for the most part. Probably 90% of those two. So that's where that growth would come from. So thank you Tim and we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. Can you guys just give us the quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year trajectories by geography? I know they're just shipped to locations, but I think it's still useful as a proxy for demand and overall economic activity, just depending on the breadth of the participation?
Dave Pahl
Sure, Harlan. Yes. A year ago, Asia was up and all of the other regions were down. And sequentially, all of the regions were up, and Japan was down. Do you have a follow-on?
Harlan Sur
Yes. So you guys mentioned last quarter that there may have been some industrial customers that were building some inventory to potentially buffer against future supply chain disruptions and just prudent business continuity planning. Did you guys continue to see that in Q3? Or are these customers starting to work down these inventories, or just sustaining the higher levels as we head into the winter months and flu season?
Dave Pahl
Yes. And, Harlan, I think our comments last quarter were one, just more of an observation of history in our industry, that basically it's taught us that whenever we've seen supply constraints, that customers react by building some inventory. So it's just our belief that it would be naive that this would be the first time that, that wouldn't happen, right? So, I think, that those supply constraints in our industry still exist. So to that extent, that could still be the case.
And now our lead times have remained stable. Our product availability is still very high. I think today, you can go to ti.com and get immediate availability of over 40,000 different devices. And that doesn't mean that we don't have pockets of delivery problems. We'll always have that at any time. But, overall, our lead times are very solid. And availability is high, but that's not true for the industry. So, yes, I think it just would be naive to believe that, that wouldn't be the case. So thank you, Harlan. We’ll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask some questions. Congratulations on the solid results. David, if you look at kind of your guidance over the last two quarters, it looks like you sort of rightfully discounted kind of what the bottoms-up bookings was telling us. You said as much when you guided for the June quarter.
And just given the magnitude of beat in September, it kind of feels the same way. And that to me seems to make sense in the midst of a global pandemic. I'm just kind of curious, you're guiding the December quarter to plus or minus about seasonal, inclusive of what sounds like a 200 basis point headwind from Huawei.
But, I guess, I could argue maybe phone builds started a little bit later this year that should help December. I guess, as you forecast the December quarter, was seasonal kind of the metric you were going for? And are you discounting kind of your bottoms-up in the December quarter as much in hindsight as you did in June and September?
Dave Pahl
Yes. No, I think, you've covered a lot of good points, John. And like you point out, in any quarter there's puts and takes. You've got the headwind of Huawei. We've got the unwind of the distributor program, which in fact we've actually wound that up this past quarter, and just with the growing demand and the inventory needs and positions that we've essentially completed that. So we depleted about, as Rafael, I think mentioned, about $100 million worth of inventory in that quarter.
So you've always got puts and takes. But I'll tell you that the most important thing that we see and the most important input that we get is the demand that our customers tell us they want. And we get that from the orders in the backlog that our customers provide us as well as demand fees that we get through consignment. And so that is really what drives and informs the outlook that we provide. So you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer
Yes. Dave, it's fair to say that there's been nothing typical this year, but you and I have talked about this in the past. If you look at the year-over-year growth discrepancy between analog and embedded, it's fairly wide. And I'm wondering now that we're 90 days more into this kind of difference in year-over-year growth, is there a good explanation in your mind? And importantly as we look forward, when do you expect the embedded business to kind of catch up to analog on a year over year basis?
Dave Pahl
Yes, sure. I think that certainly, the embedded business isn't performing the way that we would want it to over the last multiple quarters. And I think that if you look over the most recent quarter here, certainly we're encouraged by the progress or the numbers that, that would show. But we've been working very hard on turning that business around and getting it performing like we would like it to be performing.
And we're making investments there because we believe that it will be a great contributor in the coming years. So -- and so we're busy building that business stronger, and -- but it will take time. And success in that business will be not measured over this quarter or even over a couple of quarters, but will be measured over time. So thank you for that, John. And with that, we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
Hi, guys. I wanted to follow-up on that same last question of John's on the embedded side of things. Dave, last quarter where embedded was sequentially weak and year-over-year weak, you talked about the over-indexing to automotive and industrial. But given that automotive was up 75% sequentially, I'm a little surprised embedded was basically the same as analog from a sequential perspective. Were there some offsets in that business? I know you said industrial was down a little bit, but it doesn't seem like it would be enough to offset that over-indexing on the -- excuse me, on the Automotive side?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Well, embedded grew a little faster than analog. And essentially just as last quarter as you pointed out Ross, that it didn't have any offsets to the business. Essentially, all you have left is industrial. So it's those two end markets. And so with the return of revenue, it's performing about the same as analog is. So those are the two -- those are really the two components driving that.
Rafael Lizardi
So it doesn't have nearly as much PE or in fact hardly any PE, personal electronics. And personal electronics was a big contributor to growth in third quarter, sequential growth.
Dave Pahl
That's right. That's right. Do you have a follow-on?
Ross Seymore
Great. I guess my follow-up. Yeah. If I can pivot over to the industrial side, just a higher-level question. You guys seem to be flat to up year-to-date in your industrial segment. How do you explain the actual growth in that segment versus the global GDP and the general economic activity dropping?
It doesn't seem like the inventory concerns are as high as what you had last quarter, where you first said it would be naive to think otherwise. It seems like some of those concerns have gone by the wayside, but you're still nonetheless outperforming the global economy. If it's not inventory, I guess, what is it?
Dave Pahl
Well, the longer-term thesis of course is that content is expanding inside of those markets. And I think if you look below, we talked about there's areas of strength and there's areas of weakness. So if you look at certain markets like aerospace and defense that is obviously weak, people aren't taking deliveries of planes, as an example.
There's other areas of strength like appliances. If anyone that's listening on the call that is doing any home renovations like my wife is, you have to wait multiple months to, just to get home appliances. And so we're seeing very, very strong strength in those types of areas.
So – but I think the diversity of that market, coupled with the content expansion, I think just proves out why it's such an attractive market for us. And our products are really tailor-made and well positioned to take advantage of that market.
Rafael Lizardi
Right. And the other thing I would add is listen, we have 100,000 different customers, 80,000 different products. The vast majority of those sell in to industrial. That is the most diverse end market. So it'd be impossible for us to know what those customers are doing and what that adds up to.
The important part is the way we run the company to give ourselves the highest possible optionality, so that if it is driven by secular trends or asset is driven by the secular trends over the long haul, maybe any one quarter it could, or two quarters it could oscillate. And it could be inventory building. But over the long term, those secular trends are there, and we put ourselves in a good position tactically to have that inventory available to support our customers.
And if we have a correction, inventory correction or something of that sort, we'll go through that. And that inventory will not go back. It will not go back. We'll have it in storage for years, and then we'll sell it at the other end of that, of whatever correction we may have.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Raf. We’ll go to the next caller, please
Operator
Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg
Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask John's question a bit differently. Does it feel like bookings are not going to back to reflecting true end demand? Obviously, this year everything has been abnormal, right? But as I think about your fourth quarter guidance, is it safe to say that bookings are now running very much aligned with end demand?
Dave Pahl
Well, Tore, that's always a question that we don't have precise insight to, right? We don't have a system that tells us that. I think you have to even go back to third quarter 2018, where the market had turned. We're going through a classic inventory cycle. We worked our way through that through 2019. And just as we bottomed out and saw signs of inflection, COVID-19 hit.
So that kind of changed things, but certainly we started this year with inventories at lower levels. And so that – certainly, that's where we started the year, right? So – but inventories and demand are certainly tied together. And – so I don't believe that they were ever largely disconnected over time.
Rafael Lizardi
And so much of our business is on consignment or just-in-time demand, that the bookings versus revenue trend is really not that meaningful.
Dave Pahl
That's right. Yes. So it's almost what inventory our customers have that's downstream. And so that's why I think that we, from an optionality standpoint, try to ensure that we've got product available that if things want to continue to strengthen from here, we're in a position to support it. And that's the posture that we're taking. If it doesn't, we certainly know what to do in the other direction as well. You have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg
Yes, that's fair. Thank you. So I know communications is smaller for you and it may even be less of a strategic end market for you, but it did take a sequential breather. It was still up year-over-year. Directionally, do you have any views on where that market is headed?
Dave Pahl
Well, it – I think that our longer-term thesis is, is that it's not a structural grower, just there's not new subscribers being added to the network overall. We've made investments in 5G, and we'll benefit from it. But as you say, it's just not a very large portion of our revenues. 
Certainly, there's noise in this quarter's numbers with Huawei, but growth will resume. And as it always does, I think everyone in the industry describes it as a choppy market and that doesn't make it a bad market, it just makes it choppy. And so we'll continue investments there. It's a good market for us. And we'll continue to make investments in it, and we continue to like it. 
And thank you, Tore. I think we've got time for one last caller, please?
Operator
We'll take our last question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave and Rafael, I had a question on the industrial business as well. So clearly it's seemingly very resilient if I look back at the past cycles. But is it also because -- and I know you guys look at it very long-term as well. 
2019, for four consecutive quarters and for the full year, it was down. So is this because as we -- and I think Dave, you mentioned that in an answer to an earlier question, is that when we entered the year, really it was -- the supply chain was drained out of any excesses because of what you have seen. And so now we are, despite all the problems we've seen and the demand collapsing in certain end markets and industrials, it's held in also because of that factor, that the supply chain inventory was pretty lean?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think we've just completed seven quarters of year-on-year declines. This is the first quarter of year-on-year growth that we've had. So industrial's been a piece of that. I think those year-on-year declines, a good part of that was just our industry cyclicality, as you pointed out. So I -- that -- but structurally, industrial with its breadth and if you look, we've got 13 sectors that we're investing in. All of them are -- have content that's growing. And so we're -- I think we're very positioned -- positioned very well to be able to support that growth.
So what we can't call and what we don't know is in the short-term, how the economy is going to behave. And even in a weak environment, that market has done reasonably well compared to some of the other markets. You have a follow-on?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes, just a quick one on the Embedded side. I think last earnings call also, you mentioned that you're encouraged by the signs of stabilization. I just wanted to -- just help us understand what are some of the steps you have taken to ride the business. And as you've said, it doesn't happen overnight. And you talked about investments and I know several years ago, you said that you were going to de-emphasize comms infrastructure, because that's longer term, you didn't see growth there, at least on the comms on the Embedded side.
So is the investment profile in this business looking a little bit different as you look forward? And what are some of the other steps that you guys have taken to ""ride"" the business and get it back on track?
Dave Pahl
Yes. The -- yes, so you've highlighted a couple of steps that we have taken in the past. I think none of those have been secrets. The decisions on the comms side was something that we had talked about, I think, going back six, seven years ago now, as we didn't believe that comms equipment was going to be a structural grower. And specifically on the Embedded side, we did believe that there was some opportunities on the Analog side, so we took up investments there. And we're enjoying the benefits of those investments on the Analog side today, but that did provide a headwind.
We talked about, I think, it was a couple of quarters ago now the -- some of the restructuring that you mentioned inside of the Embedded business. And we've got, I think, eight different product groups and we took down some of the resources in some and took up some of the resources in others. And really just getting resources on to the best opportunities overall and making sure that we have resources into the places that we believe will be the best growth opportunities.
And I'd just say in general, what we're trying to do is leverage our competitive advantages, ensure that the products that we are investing in have a broad-based appeal in a customer base standpoint and they'll be products that will generate cash flow for a long time to come.
And just taking a step back, again, I'd say that we're investing in that business, because we believe it will be a great contributor when we look at the years ahead, so. And so again, there's a lot of effort going into building that business stronger, but it will take time. So that's success would be measured over years, not just in a quarter or two.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap us up for the night.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave. Let me wrap up by emphasizing what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for our owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.
Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements: A great business model focused on Analog and Embedded Products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages; two, discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities; and lastly, efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.
While we strive to achieve our objectives, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers and communities and owners all benefit.
Thank you, and have a good evening.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments 2Q 2020 earnings release conference call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today and we will provide the following updates. First, I will start with a reminder of the framework we described during that April earnings call for how we will navigate the COVID-19 economy. Next, I will provide insight into second quarter revenue results with more details than usual by end-market including sequential performance since it's more informative at this time. And lastly, Rafael will cover financial results, some insight into one-time items, and our guidance for the third quarter.
During the April call, we explained that we will use the three ambitions to drive our decisions as they are particularly helpful in uncertain times like we face with COVID-19. For decades, these ambitions have driven all decisions inside TI. They are to act like owners who will own the company for decades. Secondly, to adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And third, to be a company that you are proud to be a part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor. When we pursue these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities, and owners will all benefit.
While second quarter did not experience the depth of the decline we saw in the 2008 financial crisis, nonetheless we remain cautious on how the economy might behave over the next few years. As a reminder, in April we provided a broader framework to help you understand how we will operate through this environment. First, we will maintain high optionality with our operating plan so we can support customers, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast will be limited. Next, we will maintain investments in R&D and in new capabilities like those for ti.com, since they are five to 10 year time horizon decisions and critical to building TI stronger. And finally, we will invest to ensure long-term manufacturing capacity, particularly for the 2022 to 2025 timeframe.
Making decisions with our ambitions in mind will continue to serve us well, and that coupled with the framework I just mentioned should help you understand our actions. We are particularly pleased with our decision to maintain an operating plan that allowed us to maximize our optionality. During the second quarter, we were able to respond to unforecasted demand. We will continue to maintain this posture in the third quarter.
Moving on, I will now provide some insight into our second quarter revenue. There are several key points to summarize what we are seeing in the market. First, overall the weakness was primarily from the automotive market. Automotive was down about 40% sequentially and down over 40% compared to a year ago. To help appreciate this impact, excluding automotive, TI was up 8% sequentially and down 3% versus a year ago. The automotive market appears to have bottomed in May as North American and European assembly plants resumed operations.
Next, the industrial market was up about 2% sequentially and also up 2% from a year ago. There are end-markets that are weak and others that are understandably strong, like medical. We do believe that some customers are trying to maintain strong inventory positions to limit exposure to any supply chain disruptions.
Personal electronics was up over 20% sequentially and up about 10% compared to a year ago. This can best be explained by work from home trends and TI being in a position to support unforecasted demand in the second quarter.
Next, communications equipment was up 20% sequentially, but down 15% compared to a year ago. Within this market, it's important to note that analog achieved sequential and year-over-year growth, while embedded was down in both comparisons following our planned decline in this portion of the business. Enterprise systems was up sequentially and year-over-year. This strength, similar to personal electronics, is best explained by work from home trend and TI being positioned to support unforecasted demand.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Second quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, down 12% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue and gross profit margin was even. Operating expenses in the quarter were $780 million, down 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D.
Operating profit was $1.2 billion in the quarter, or 38% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, or $1.48 per share, which included a $0.33 benefit primarily for tax-related items that were not in our prior outlook. The benefit included $0.02 of restructuring charges to strengthen our embedded business by focusing investments on the best opportunities for long term growth.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $130 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.7 billion. In the quarter, we paid $823 million in dividends and repurchased $882 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.7 billion. In total, we have returned $6.7 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 56% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 1.75% due in 10 years. This resulted in total debt of $6.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. We have repaid $500 million of debt due in second quarter, and we have no further debt due this year. We have $550 million of debt due in 2021.
Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were up $133 million from first quarter, and days were 166, about as expected. Distribution-owned inventory declined again in second quarter by about $150 million, the seventh consecutive quarter of planned reductions as we continued the transition to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct. Tactically and strategically, we are pleased. We have held total inventory dollars steady, while increasing the percent of inventory held inside TI and therefore in fewer places. This enables us to continue to maintain short lead times and high availability to meet unforecasted customer demand.
For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.26 billion to $3.54 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. Regarding our factory operating plan, as we have stated, we will maintain high optionality so we can continue to support customers' demand, particularly during a time when their ability to forecast may continue to be limited.
We have informed our customers that lead times on our products remain short and more than 40,000 products are available for immediate shipment on TI.com. Short lead times and high availability are important capabilities that allow us to continue to support customers' near term and unforecasted demand. Our product portfolio of mostly long-lived parts affords us to have a steady hand and therefore, we will take a similar approach to our factory operating plan again in third quarter.
In closing, we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger. History has shown us that it is in times like these when we can make the most strategic progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I have, you still mentioned that you think some of your industrial customers are trying to build, I guess, inventories and making sure that their own position is still strong. But if your lead times are short and you are building, you have 40,000 products that are ready to ship, why would any of your customers actually have any need to pre-buy anything? And if so, do you think what you are seeing right now is maybe just more indicative of what the actual end demand state might look like? Like how do we square that circle?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Stacy, it's a good question. I think you know, as we have talked about last quarter, we saw some unusual order patterns. As we talked about revenue running up really strong into March and things abating, they certainly didn't abate as we thought that they would. We saw supply constraints across the industry, and sometimes as customers' orders, as they look at building inventory, our visibility ends at their dock when we ship them products. So, they may decide to build some finished good inventory, so we don't have visibility into that. So that's really not a number that we can look into a system to provide us that. It's really just more instinct and experience and also just talking to our field teams and getting input from that standpoint. So, when we look at the numbers, that's what it is telling us.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Stacy, just to add to that, a few comments. One, out of our 100,000 or so customers, I will guess 70,000 to 80,000 of those are in industrial., right. So, it's frankly just difficult to draw conclusions with such a huge number of customers that have different idiosyncrasies in the way they behave. The other thing I would tell you is that, if I am a purchasing manager at one of these customers, and I am ordering 200 different parts for a board, are they really going to treat certain suppliers a little differently than others, if they decided to build inventory to stock up and feel safer, probably not, right. So, that's another dynamic that may be you should take into account.
Dave Pahl
And not in all cases.
Rafael Lizardi
Right.
Dave Pahl
Not in all cases. So, there is probably some of that and that's just the caution that that would provide. You have a follow-up, Stacey?
Stacy Rasgon
Yes. I guess just to follow-up on that a little bit. So, if I look at kind of the trajectory you have had over the last few quarters, Q1 you are above seasonal; Q2, ex-auto you were above seasonal; your Q3 guide is kind of at the low end of seasonal, but kind of roughly. I mean, so far like at least outside of auto, it doesn't seem like the pandemic is having any real impact on you guys at all. I just find it a little surprising, what are you hearing from your customers, if anything, as to that effect in terms of what they are seeing and the impact that the pandemic is having on the supply chain? Because as far as I can tell, it's not having much impact on you at all, I guess, which is good.
Dave Pahl
Well, I will remind you that the number we have turned in was down 12%, right.
Stacy Rasgon
Yes. But it was up 8%, ex-auto, right?
Dave Pahl
Correct. Yes. And unfortunately, we have to report the numbers with auto in. So well, that is the reality, and auto was down 40%. So, you know, that is real. And the auto manufacturers closed down because of COVID. So, I wouldn’t quite go so far to say that it didn't have an impact. And you know, if you look inside of that, you saw strength in some areas like the work from home trends, like PCs and tablets and servers from the inside of enterprise, right. So, we are seeing some strength that's due to that which is also driving that. So there is some things that are moving around that we saw. And the other thing that if you look longer term, as we entered the year, as you know, I think we described back in January that we were seeing signs of stabilization with the fourth quarter results as we had worked our way through the bottom of the cycle. We are starting to see those signs of stabilization. Now with those signs of stabilization, again, we just turned in a down 12% overall. So, those are the results and we do have to report the numbers all in but I think it is important, we wanted to give the color of auto because that was the driver of the weakness from the year ago.
So, thanks Stacy. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We will hear now from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to actually pick up from that point on automotive. I am curious, Rafael or Dave, what you are expecting your automotive business to do in Q3? Because when I look at your auto sales, I think you mentioned down over 40%. They are kind of in line with units. And I know just picking on one quarter is not representative of the trend, but some of your auto peers said they benefited from content growth and so forth. So, my question is, what do you think about just the broader automotive market heading into Q3? And do you think you can start to get back to a point where you get some content growth on top of whatever unit recovery that we might see?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Vivek, I think that's a great clarification. So obviously, what we are reporting is just our shipments. When factories close, they stop taking product. You know that for our revenues overall, a large portion of our revenues overall are on consignment. So, there is not inventory sitting between us and those manufacturing lines. In general, I describe the automotive market as being a more mature supply chain. So, those supply chains will react faster than, let's say an industrial supply chain would perhaps. And so, when those factories open back on, they begin to pull those units. So, we won't try to predict what the overall market is going to do. We can measure when customers are pulling that demand. Our confidence in content growth, three and five years from now in automobiles remains very high, but just try to draw the dots of a cyclical recovery, we just won't spend time trying to do that.
So do you have follow-on?
Vivek Arya
Yes. Thanks Dave. So on the factory plan, I recall, Rafael, you mentioned that you expect your factory plans in Q3 to be the same as Q2 and we saw inventory go up in Q2. What do you think your inventory levels will do in Q3? And what I am trying to do is try to align, your Q3 guidance seems to be seasonal, as was asked before, even the range of outlook seems to be very in line with normal guidance, but your commentary seems to be more conservative, certainly visibility on the macro side seems to be a little more difficult. So I am just trying to get a better sense for what does your plan for production in Q3 tell us about your visibility on to your end customers and the level of demand?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Sure. First, a couple of things. First, the environment continues to be uncertain. So I want to make sure that's clear. We remain cautious how this economy will behave for the next several years, okay. So that is very important. That is part of the way we are looking at this. At the same time, we want to keep our optionality, maximize our optionality. And what that means is, be able to meet unforecasted demand from our customers like we just did in second quarter and we plan to continue that in third quarter and beyond. The reason we can do that, strategically we are just very well positioned. The parts that we sell tends to be the majority of them catalog parts that sell to many, many customers that last a long, long time. So if we end up building inventory, that inventory is not going to go bad. We don't have to scrap it. So that plays very well in our favor. Essentially, it's a very symmetrical bet that we are making where the upside is really high, the downside is limited. So we are going to continue operating that way.
Dave Pahl
That's great. Thank you Vivek. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We will hear now from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the execution. I just wanted to go back to performance or performance by segment. Obviously in Q2, it was a significant beat in terms of revenue. And Dave, thanks very much for giving color on a sequential basis and a year-over-year basis. But relative to what you are thinking internally, where did the beat come from? Was it broad-based or was it focused in one or two businesses?
Dave Pahl
Well, I think that in general, if you look at the areas of strength that we had, certainly in areas that were driven by the work from home, the PCs, tablets, the servers, those were areas that we saw strength. Automotive, obviously, when things shut down, they shut down. And that had turned off pretty much like a light switch as the numbers would show. And I think that inside of industrial, you have got the numbers of down or the 2% or so from a transition standpoint. So yes, definitely the strength that we saw we had in the work from home areas.
You have a follow-on?
Toshiya Hari
I do. As you guys know, M&A is clearly topical in the group right now and Rafael, I was just hoping you can remind us what's sort of the criteria is when it comes to M&A for you guys at TI? And sort of a two-part question. Is it fair to say that your posture is a little bit more conservative or cautious, given the current macro and geopolitical backup as well as where evaluations lie? Or is it pretty much business as usual for you guys on the M&A front? Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. That's a good question and it's interesting the way you framed it. So let me maybe first remind everybody our framework. Any acquisition that we consider needs to meet two criteria. First, it needs to be a good strategic fit. So that an analog company with catalog parts, differentiated parts that then go into auto and industrial, because that's where we focus as where the content growth is happening and that would align well with our strategy. But the next piece is that price needs to make sense. And that is after, once you make the purchase, in three, four, five years, are you meeting the cost of capital, are you beating the cost of capital. And think of it on a cash on cash standpoint. Invest $100 and my cost of capital is 10%, when am I going to get $10 after tax on that investment. Can I beat that $10 and get $15 or $20 over time? So that is our criteria. That's the one we have had for many years and we continue to have it.
On your second part of your question, frankly in an environment like we are going through, this is a great time to make the most of opportunities. So we are not conservative. We are following the same framework that we have followed. And based on that framework, we are evaluating M&A opportunities, but more importantly we are continuing to invest internally. We are making our competitive advantages stronger. We continue to invest in R&D. We haven't scaled back that at all. We continue to invest in things like ti.com and our retail market channels. And of course our manufacturing and technology, where we broke ground on the new facility, the new, the second, RFAB in Richardson and we are going to investing to have that building ready over the next 18 to 24 months. So we continue to do that to strengthen the company and now is a great time to do it. We are very well positioned from a balance sheet standpoint, from a P&L, free cash flow standpoint, a lot better than our competitors. So it's a good time to take advantage of that.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thank you Toshiya. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We will hear from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore
Hi guys. Thanks a lot for letting me ask a question and congrats on the strong results. I wanted to go into the source of the upside that Dave and Rafael, you guys talked about, the work from home side, I think everybody understands why that was better. But the big question that's still outstanding to me is the sustainability of that. So can you just talk about that the upside surprise, do you think, is sustainable? I know you are not guiding by end markets. You never do. But how do you envision the second half of the year in those same areas that upsided?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Ross, I think that when we look at our business longer term, we look at where we are investing for growth. Industrial and automotive is where the investments go, especially industrial. That's where we expect growth to be, you know, when we look at three and five and 10 year growth, perhaps for next couple of decades. So we believe that growth is very sustainable and that's really where we are focused. I will say that some of the growth that we are seeing is due because of the optionality that Rafael talked about how. We have recently updated our customers. We got 40,000 products that we have immediate availability on today. So if that demand is the sustainable in the second half, we have got the products available to ship into any of our markets overall in the short term. But our long term prospects, I think, are really what's more important.
Do you have a follow-on?
Ross Seymore
I do. Thanks for that answer. I want to switch over to the two product segments, the two main ones, analog and embedded. I just wanted to see if there is any update on your views on the embedded side? I know you said there was a little bit of a restructuring built into that $0.33 gain, I guess as a little bit of an offset. But the big picture question is, you are now down to the lowest percentage of sales embedded has been since at least in my model of 2012. And the year-over-year decline is so much larger than the analog side. So can you just talk a little bit about when do you think that business bottoms out? What sort of restructuring needs to be done? And do you think that business is a growth driver over time for the company? Or is it something that we should just envision as remaining a much smaller part of the company than it once was?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think when we look at the embedded business, the embedded market, as we talked about before, it shares many of the attributes that the analog market does and we believe that it will be, it has been and will continue to be a contributor to free cash flow growth. When you look at that business and look at the share gains that it's had, look at 2016, 2017 and really the better part of 2018, it has had share gains. It gave some of that back in 2019, of course. But here, more recently, we talked about last quarter, you saw some sequential growth out of that business all in. We talked about the fact that without auto, you would have seen sequential growth in that business this quarter. So I think we are seeing signs of stabilization inside of that business. So we have taken action to strengthen that business to dive into that. We have got across microcontrollers and processors, there is eight businesses. Three of them actually, we have increased resources. Two of them, we have actually decreased resources. And three of them have stayed about the same. So that's portfolio management that you have seen us take across our businesses over the years. So we do believe that that business will be a contributor to free cash flow. There is a lot of the work going on to ensure that it is.
So, okay. Thank you very much Ross. And will go to the next caller.
Operator
Thank you. We will hear from Chris Danley with Citi. Please go ahead.
Chris Danley
Hi. Thanks guys. Dave, I think you mentioned that you thought there is some inventory buildout there. I believe you said it was just in industrial. Can you give us a sense of how much do you think that helped? And what gives you confidence it's not occurring in any other product lines? And did you guys notice anything, any kind of strength by certain geographies out there?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Chris, you know that you have heard us talk, you have heard me say multiple times in the past that I joked that I have never once taken a double order or an order for an inventory build. And obviously, customers don't mark it that way when they send an order in. So that is something that we can't see. As I have talked about before with 60%, 65% of our revenue on consignment, we don't have inventory of our products sitting in front of the manufacturing line. So our visibility ends right there. So we don't have a system that tells us if customers are building inventory. But just when you look at the numbers and you look at the strength and you add things up, that's what our intuition tells us. So we are just mindful of that. We think it's important just to point that out. So could it be in other areas? It could be. But our belief is, it's not significant but we think it's important to point it out.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. And let me just add to that point. Your question was on the customer side. Let me remind you of the distribution side where we do have visibility, we drain $150 million of distributor-owned inventory. That's on top of the $50 million we drained last quarter. So, so far, year-to-date it's $200 million and we think we will be able to drain another $150 million or so for the rest of the year. So we will probably end up draining $350 million or so of inventory. And that make a lot of sense given the changes in distribution that we are making. We are bringing more customers direct. So then we can control that inventory will be, essentially on our balance sheet as we build more inventory on our balance sheet so we can support those customers direct.
The other comment I will make regarding that, given that drain now we only have about three weeks of inventory in the distri-channel, down about a week from the prior quarter. But I will tell you that that metric is already less meaningful than it was before and it will continue to be less meaningful as we make that distribution channel smaller over time. But I just wanted to give the data point, so you have it.
Do you have a follow-up Chris?
Chris Danley
It's on that last statement. So you said that, you have got three weeks of inventory in the distri-channel. I guess if we look at your days of inventory right now, it's 170. I mean balance sheet looks like the feds from a first glance. Should we expect this to be the new normal going forward, like right around 170 days? Or should this be the same dollar level? Or I guess what should we sort of calibrate our models to, for inventory going forward at TI?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. A few comments. One is, as I just said, the distribution-owned inventory, we have been draining for seven quarters in a row. So if you look at the entire ecosystem, right, including the distribution inventories plus our inventory, over the last couple years, probably seven or eight quarters, is relatively flat, right. So you have to, I think it makes sense, we think it makes sense to think about it that way. And then the other angle, as I mentioned earlier and we talked about it in our prepared remarks, is the great optionality that having that inventory gives us. And we just showed that in second quarter and we will continue to do it because it is an asymmetric bet that having that inventory there is a working capital cost associated with that. But the scrap risk on that is really, really low, yet the potential upside of serving our customers well with very low lead times, in many cases as we said immediate availability, we think that longer term is something customers do and will continue to appreciate.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Chris. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We will take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thank you very much. Dave, I apologize for the background noise. Economic activity is humming around where I live. Gross margin, the quarter margin was much higher than what a normal fall through model would suggest. So I was wondering, is it just a factor of how low embedded is and that's the mix that's contributing to the gross margin being so strong this quarter? Or is there something else going on? Because your utilization was flat quarter-on-quarter.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. What I would tell you, as we have guided for many years, you should think of revenue coming in and out at 70% to 75%. That's a good guide to use over the entire cycle. Of course, any one quarter could be a little more or a little less. And then over the longer term, of course, 300 millimeter and continuing to add revenue on 300 millimeter has a structural cost advantage that helps our margin just continue to be a tailwind on margins. It has been and will continue to be.
Dave Pahl
Do you have follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes. I do. Back to microcontrollers, embedded, now that you have been looking at the data and I am sure you have been looking at it before. And it's good to see that stabilizing and you are seeing some signs of stabilization, especially, how low it is. Is there some insight you could provide us between the connected and the processor side that would help explain the divergence that we have seen from the overall analog over the last, not three years as you were pointing out first, if we look back at three years, only in the last six or seven quarters? Has it really been diverging from the industry?
Dave Pahl
Yes. There is not that much difference in the trend between microcontrollers and the processor business. And really, if you look at the longer trend line and that's really what shares doesn't move around quickly inside of those businesses, whether it's analog or embedded overall and then if you drop down into microcontrollers or processors. So again, if you look at kind of 2016 and 2017 and the three quarters of 2018, those businesses really did have a real strong track record of share gains and the deterioration began to happen in 2019 where it gained some of that back. So again, we are taking the actions to strengthen that business. We believe that what we are doing will get that business performing and having it to be a strong contributor to free cash flow.
So thank you Ambrish. And I think we have time for one more caller, please.
Operator
Thank you. We will take our next question from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein
Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. There is very slow moving but I think long term relatively meaningful risk as it relates to China trying to develop a domestic strong semiconductor capability. Some might argue that given the current state of affairs, both economically and politically that perhaps there could be some acceleration in that regard recently. And I am hoping you might update us as to what you are seeing from this competitive threat.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So just to give you some thoughts on that. We think of that in a way similar as we think of our competitors, meaning that our competitive advantage has put us in a good place to compete against American, European competitors just as well as the Chinese. And having one, our own manufacturing with 300 millimeter, that puts us, gives us that structural cost advantage. The other one is the broadest portfolio in the industry, close to 100,000 different parts. And that's particularly relevant with industrial and automotive where, in the case of industrial for example, there are probably 80,000 different customers, right. So you want to be able to have the entire suite of parts in the analog space and embedded space. It makes it more likely that they will buy from you, it makes the investment on the sales side more worthwhile and then with the diverse and long-lived positions that results into. And partially because of those advantages and the way that is structured, it's just difficult to go after that space, right. So what we have seen where companies in China, really anywhere, where they first go after is the kind of vertical markets in places like memory or digital spaces that is frankly just easier to go after, easier to get revenue growing quickly and then you can reinvest that and go from there. In the analog space, we have average prices in the $0.30 to $0.40. Embedded is higher than that, but not that much higher. It's just hard. And then the 80,000 different customers that you go after, the 100,000 different parts is a daunting task, right. It's not impossible. So we are very respectful of that and our job is to stay ahead of all our competitors, no matter where they are, American, European, Asian. So we will continue investing in that, in those advantages, in manufacturing, in the broad portfolio, in the reach of channels to make that climb even harder every year.
Do you have a follow-up?
William Stein
Yes. I appreciate that answer. It sounds like there is no meaningful change recently in this threat relative to any others. I wanted to follow-up on the distribution commentary around, I think, another $150 million of inventory to go. When we think about the $50 million, the $150 million down in the quarter and I think you said $150 million left in the back half. Should we think about that as proportional to the amount or to the percentage of distribution business that's going to transition this year? And is that still on track to finish by the end of the year?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So it is on track to finish by the end of the year. And what happens there is, by the end of the year, we are just going have a much smaller distribution footprint, the number of distributors that we engage with. And at the same time, we will have transitioned a fair amount of customers to shipping direct. So with lesser distribution, we will deal with fewer distributors, then more of our revenue going direct. And that is, yes, I guess it is proportional to that drain of inventory that you are referring to.
Dave Pahl
But it also includes reduction in inventory of the distributors that will be with us as well.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I am glad you mentioned that. So yes, so part of what that reduction is, is that the distributors that we are going to stay with, for the most part, they will be on full consignment. So anything that we sell with them and there's a few exceptions in Japan, for example, but other than that, they will be in full consignment. So really they are going to have zero own inventory for the most part. So that is also reflected in the $350 million.
Rafael Lizardi
So I think that was the last question. So let me just wrap up by summarizing what we have said previously. We will continue to invest in and strengthen our four competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will also continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit. Thank you very much.

Vivek Arya
Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. This is Vivek Arya, senior semiconductor and semi-cap equipment analyst at Bank of America Securities. Really delighted to have Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations for Texas Instruments joining us this afternoon to share his insights about TI and the industry. And logistics wise, we will go through some prepared questions from my side. But if you have any question, please feel free to e-mail it to me through that console textbox that you have, and I'll make sure to weave it in, in the Q&A.
"
2020-06-04,Q&A," Session
Q - Vivek Arya
But with that, welcome Dave. And to maybe kick it off, perhaps give us a state of the union in terms of what TI has seen so far in terms of just any near term demand or supply impact from the COVID pandemic? And then we will go into longer term trends.
Dave Pahl
Sure, Vivek. Well, first of all, thanks for inviting and having us today. We appreciate that. And I think maybe just to frame things and many of listen to our earnings call and not providing any update from that call. So all the references will be from what we saw at that point. But just to put in context as we operate the company there’s really three things that we want to keep in mind is, the first thing is we want to operate the company as owners and really owners with a long-term investment horizon. The other two ambitions just adapt and change, and certainly, with COVID-19 coming just having that ability to be able to move quickly is important. And the last thing is just having a company that you're proud to work at and would want to have as a labor. And if we can do those three things, really all of our constituents, our owners and employees of the company I think we all benefit. 
As we talked about, when we look at the environment, more specific to your question, we really look back to 2008 and the GFC is the most recent exogenous event that happened to look at, to learn from, not because we believe that's the shape of this curve and trying to get into the debates of the shapes of the curve but just a model of that we could learn from. And so, we're taking that learning. It's informing how we're running the operations from that learning. It's going into our decisions on continuing our OpEx investments in R&D as we talked about in the call, keeping those steady, also from a CapEx standpoint. The CapEx that we're investing in this year is mainly going into infrastructure investments that will have capacity implications in the 2022-2025 timeframe. So those are also remaining -- remain steady. 
So, we're not trying to predict what the shape of the curve looks like here as in the near-term and what the recovery will look like. We're really trying to, from an operational standpoint, ensure we've got as many options to support that curve and be ready for whatever the economy is going to throw at us. So, that's what we're trying to do as a management team here in the short-term.
Vivek Arya
Then maybe, Dave, just to kind of go one level deeper in that, how is TI from a supply perspective? Are you able to fulfill all customer orders? Have you seen any disruption from a supply perspective? And then we will talk about the different demand side drivers.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And I think we had Rich on our call and I think he framed it as luck is when opportunity meets preparation. And I think we were prepared for the unforeseen events that the COVID provided. And back in late March as the industry was struggling to meet supply, many of our peers had to extend lead times or had difficulties with supply. And as we saw some of unusual order patterns from our customers, we actually put a communications out on our website towards the end of March, and I think we recently updated it in May, still out on the main page of our website, if anyone is interested in what that communication look like. But basically said, try to reassure customers. We've got the product available. Our lead times remain stable, that's really for three things. And Vivek, you and I have had many discussions about how we view inventory and the importance of it, and how -- the actions that we've taken to own and control that inventory, and investments that we've made there. So, we came into this time period with a good position on inventory, number one. 
The second thing is, is that we own and control our manufacturing facilities. So we’ve got a dozen wafer fabs. So we've got a half a dozen assembly test sites. Those not by accident are in geographically diverse locations. And so, that allows us to have the third thing, which is a very robust business continuity plan. So as the world goes into lockdown, and just as New York had more restrictive lockdown requirements than say Dallas, there are parts of the Philippines as an example, we got two assembly test sites in the Philippines. Those that were near Malaysia were different than our operations in Baguio and we've got parts that are multi-sourced across those sites. So that has allowed us to continue to keep our lead times study and offer product to our customers.
Vivek Arya
Got it. And in terms of the different end market drivers from a demand perspective -- I appreciate that autos is probably weak across the board for everyone. But outside of autos, can you give us some qualitative sense of what has held up better and what has been worse than expectations so far this year?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think even to put it into context, I think that it's helpful to even go back to third quarter of '18 when we saw demand begin to weaken cyclically. And as you know, we’re working our way and trying to find a bottom. And really, we began to see what we saw -- described, if you remember in January as signs of stabilization in fourth quarter of '19. So we started the year, January as normal as whatever a normal January can be from a demand standpoint. And as we moved into February, we've got some charts that we look at revenue on a 5, 10 year basis that we look at Chinese New Year revenue going in and coming out. It clearly was very weak as we came out of Chinese New Year. It's just as factories in China struggled to come back online because of COVID-19. And then as we moved into March, I mentioned earlier, we began to see some unusual order activities just as customers got concern due to the supply constraints and that unusual order activity and strength continued into early April. And the only exception there was -- and I just described that as broad-based. And the only exception of course was automotive business. Automotive factories began closing around the world, because of COVID-19 in March. 
So after about the first week or so in April, we then began to see things decelerate broadly. And our assumption was that things would continue to decelerate through the quarter and such that May would be weaker than April or June would be weaker than May. And that's essentially how you get to the midpoint of the guidance. And, of course, we're in the period of uncertainty and we put a plus or minus 10% confidence interval around that midpoint just given the uncertainty. So, we're going to finish up the quarter. And as we normally do, we will update how things have gone so far this quarter.
Vivek Arya
Got it. So last evening, when you saw one of your competitors positively pre-announce, was your first reaction, yes that makes sense or it doesn't make any sense?”
Dave Pahl
I read those reports. I read them in the last quarter as they came out. And so, we'll put that all in context I guess when we report. 
Vivek Arya 
Okay. That's fair. The next topic Dave, I wanted to discuss with you is the whole U.S.-China trade tension dynamic. And you guys are one of the largest semiconductor companies, the largest one in analog for sure. Give us a sense for how these trade tensions have impacted you so far? And then going forward does TI need to change anything to take into account these new restrictions that the U.S. Department of Commerce is trying to put on the industry. 
Dave Pahl
Yes, so I think at the highest level, I think we would rather see both of our governments working together to get the GDP growing in both economies and the world economies versus the direction that we're going. And I think, Rich, our CEO describes it as no one calls him to have him influence in that direction. So we are likely not going to have a strong voice in that outcome. So -- and he is also a student of world history. And if you’ve studied world history as he has, if you've got a rising economic power that's challenging and existing economic power, those are probably trade tensions that -- or tensions in general that will last for decades. So our job is just over it and figure out how to be successful in that environment and not wait for some trade agreement or some agreement that is hopefully going to solve all the problems. 
More specifically, there’s been a couple of different recent rulings and regulations that have come out from the commerce department here. The most recent of which that was fairly narrowly targeted and they don't directly impact us. They could secondarily impact us, meaning that the ones that specifically impact Huawei and Hisilicon, but they don't directly impact us. 
Vivek Arya 
Alright. So can you remind us of what the remaining exposure is to Huawei? I imagine it's probably very modest. But let's say in the hypothetical, or which could be real, that if, let's say Huawei just cannot build its own base stations or its smartphones, will that have any significant impact on TI going forward? 
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, last year, Huawei was a 3% to 4% customer -- there were 3% to 4% customer in 2019 as well. And if you remember the shape the comms equipment market for us or sector, it grew very strongly, had a very strong back half 2019 and a very strong first half ‘20 and then accelerated from there. So -- and about two-thirds of Huawei revenue was tied into that comms equipment market. So it exited -- started much higher than a 3% to 4% and exited much lower as you might expect. 
Vivek Arya 
Got it. Is there any indirect exposure that you might be shipping to somebody who might ship to Huawei and some other, just trying to get…?
Dave Pahl
No. That's inclusive. That's inclusive of if we ship to a distributor, if that's what you mean or a third-party manufacturer, that is channel independent number, yes.
Vivek Arya
Got it. Next thing as it relates to the trade tension is just China's desire to become more self-sufficient in semiconductors. Have you seen any share shifts to their domestic suppliers? Do you think that risk will grow for TI over time?
Dave Pahl
I think as someone that is an owner of the company and thinking about our competitive advantages, certainly that's a risk that has to be on the radar screen, something that you think about. But because of the competitive moats that are around analog, dynamics of the market, the diversity of the revenue and the product set, just the structure of the market itself, it's just not something where market share moves quickly. It's not something that will sneak up on anyone. And it's not the type of place where big governments can spend big dollars to move quickly into our industry, right? It’s typically memory markets or processors or basebands or those big shiny objects in our industry where governments and regions of the world have moved first. So, no, we haven't seen any evidence of that. I think it -- again it’s beyond the list. It's not something that you would want to ignore. But it's just not something that would happen overnight.
Vivek Arya
Got it. I know Dave, we have discussed this issue a few times before. But I think it'd be helpful for the audience to understand what is so hard about analog that someone in China will find it tougher to copy, because it doesn't really use the most leading edge manufacturing. So what is so tough about analog that raises the barriers to entry in that business?
Dave Pahl
Yes. It's got a lot of just -- I think one of the things is just the diversity, right? So we’ve got 60,000, 70,000 products in our portfolio. We have 100,000 plus customers. And you look at the requirement of any one product and you just drive down into power as an example and any system will have a varying number of semiconductor components on it. And depending on how many parts and what parts that are on that piece of electronics, those parts will have different voltage requirements and different current requirements. So that will drive the need for different power chips to supply the right current and voltages to it, which then drives the diversity of power products. So that by its very nature drives the diversity, the number of products that you need to develop. 
The technologies that are developed are not standard. And so if you talk to the technologists, from our teams or from our peers’ teams, they'll go into great detail of why the technology is very unique and it brings us competitive advantage, which it does. But the key is it's unique. You can't use industry standard tools to develop our products. And our peers and someone in China could also develop those products but our engineers couldn't go to someone else's design shop and just do the same thing and use the same tools because they just don't exist, where on the digital side we’re using 5 nanometer or 7 nanometers or 10 nanometer digital process technologies. We’re using tools from standard design tools from Cadence or Mentor, Synopsys, those types of companies. And you can go from one semiconductor company to the next, and you're going to use the same tools and the same basic process technologies. And you're going to output it. You need to know what factory you’re going to output it to. And you are going to build it on -- in factories that are going to use the exact same manufacturing process flows from tool companies that are all developing on the same materials and the same material science. 
So there's a lot more standardization on the digital side than what there is on the analog side. So oftentimes the design and process side in analog is described as an art where on the digital side it really is more of a science. And because on the digital side, you're only looking for zero and one outcome. So that all can be abstracted and therefore can be put into a tool where on the analog side really those designers have to be down at very, very low levels. And just can't be automated. Is that -- and you're an engineer, the fact that I do a decent job of trying to summarize that. You could add any color to it because you're pretty good at it as well Vivek. 
Vivek Arya 
Absolutely. No, it's been a while since I've been at engineering, but it makes absolute sense. Maybe going to the other part, important part of your business, on the embedded side. Last year we saw a very big discrepancy between -- or big delta between your business, which was down somewhere in the mid teens versus at least for the SIA said, the broader microcontroller industry was down like closer to kind of the 6%, 7%, 8% range. I'm curious what explains that big delta and do you think that will reverse at some point? So just give us a look back on why there was that big share shift last year, because it's much bigger than what we have seen at any other previous time. And then what will it take to kind of get back in line or even get back to TI’s historical trend, which has been of taking share in those markets? 
Dave Pahl
Yes, and Vivek I think it’s a good point as you look at that in that particular year, you almost have to go back to the previous couple of years where ‘16, ‘17, and really three quarters of ‘18, there was a significant amount of outperformance. So -- and really began fourth quarter of ‘18 and through 2019 there was some share that was given back. So, in that embedded market, microcontrollers or processors, because the performance wasn't that much difference between either one of those, share just doesn't move very quickly over -- measured over longer periods of time. So I'm just real cautious to make a comment about even one quarter, one year. When you look at over that period of time, performance is more stable. But certainly, we've got work to do to ensure that performance over longer periods of time do continue to -- we do continue to gain 30 basis points, 40 basis points of share that we’re -- we've got good solid roadmaps of products that customers want. We're engaging with customers, really just doing the basic blocking and tackling that you have to do in those businesses. So that's what we're focused on and the teams -- there's a lot of attention being brought to bear on that execution. Got it. 
Vivek Arya
Got it. Could you help maybe remind our audience on what the different parts are of your embedded business and which parts were perhaps in more competitive situations last year? 
Dave Pahl
Yes. So about 60% is connected microcontroller, 40% is in processors. And there's not that much of a performance difference between the two of those. And connected microcontrollers as the word -- the description would give it, we support across that product family about a dozen wireless standards, everything from WiFi to Bluetooth to ZigBee to a Z-wave to Thread to 6LoWPAN, you want to name the alphabet soup inside of that, our team pretty much supports it, as well as our host of wired standards. And our industry gets pretty excited about all the wireless stuff and when you're connecting things, but the wired portion is very important as well for our customers. And then the processor stuff is also very, very important. And we've got a full array of processors that are intended for embedded applications in automotive. We've got processors that do ADAS processing infotainment, industrial, millimeter waves, sensors, those types of processors. 
Vivek Arya
Got it. Dave as we look at the broader economy starting to open up, do you think the recovery in your end markets will be coincident with that opening up of the broader economy? Or do you think there was perhaps some level of pull-in whereby the recovery in the diversified semiconductor industry would actually lag the recovery in the broader macro economy? 
Dave Pahl
It’s -- the simple answer is, we can't predict that, Vivek. I think that as I’ve kind of made in my opening remarks, what we're trying to do is make sure that we're ready with that, number one. And we've talked about the importance of owning and controlling our inventory in the channels. You've seen us take actions over a number of years to move to consignment, where we own and control more of that inventory that's in the channel. More recently we've taken actions to go to essentially a single distributor as we exit this year that will give us more control of that inventory, and more importantly, move us closer and have more direct relationships with our customers as we exit this year. And it's just a great time to do that transition when demand is weaker, and what we're doing internally from an inventory standpoint to position ourselves when things do recover. So, we just -- we won't be able to predict it. But we can be ready for it when it does come back.
Vivek Arya
So, when do you think the industry would get to a point where one can say, look Q2 is the trough of this cycle. Do you think the industry is there yet? Because we have seen a range of views, I think TI has kind of not expressed a specific view. We have had such -- somebody like NXP, who said outside of autos, their businesses are growing in Q2, could grow again in Q3. Microchip obviously expressed a view about Q2. When do you think TI gets into a position where you are able to save somewhat more confidence that, yes, Q2 is -- or Q3 is the bottom of the cycle? What needs to happen? 
Dave Pahl
Yes -- and Vivek you know our style. We just stick to reporting the facts and I think that that's just served us well. That's our style. And we just try to stick to the facts and report them and just we'll stay out of the debates and report what we can see and not enter into speculating on what things could be. So that’s just I think served us well in the past, so we’ll stick with that. 
Vivek Arya
Got it. Makes sense. Then on the distribution side that you've bought up Dave, so you have adopted a very different strategy versus your peers and that you have pulled back a lot from distribution. So if we look at where Q2 is in terms of just the midpoint of your outlook, do you think it already embeds all the possible headwinds in terms of pulling back from distribution? Or do you think there are some other impacts that can be felt over the next several quarters?
Dave Pahl
Well, we're going to pull out somewhere between $200 million and $250 million worth of inventory that's in the channel between now and the end of the year. So that -- a part of that is inclusive of the second quarter number. There's more to be done in third and fourth quarter as we continue to move through. So now as you know we were moving revenue to consignment last year, it's a different type of action but the result to revenue is really essentially the same. So from a year-on-year comparing a sequential compare, those effects aren’t significant. They're there but it's not significant. So -- but those numbers are there. They're baked into the numbers if you will. So that doesn't change in demand, of course. It's just moving inventory from one bucket into -- onto our balance sheet.
Vivek Arya
Got it. So just to kind of put a pin in it. If let's say Q3 happens to be seasonal, then does it mean that your revenues grow in a seasonal way or they grow somewhat less than that? Because you're still accommodating the lower distribution.
Dave Pahl
Well, another way to say it is, yes. That if we were not making this transition, our revenues would be higher. If we were -- let’s say we’re transitioning, make up a number, $75 million of that $200 million in third quarter, it would be $75 million higher.
Vivek Arya 
Got it. Yes. Okay. Next thing is, where is TI in terms of your 300 millimeter plans? And just given all the macro headbands that we have seen this year and some of the market share differences we saw in the embedded business, has that altered how you think about the rollout of additional 300 millimeter capacity? 
Dave Pahl
Yes. So simple answer is that our plans have remained unchanged. Those investments are really longer term capacity investments, as we had talked about even as we made the site selection and began to break ground at the site to put up the parking garage, which is now complete. And the old parking lot has been torn up and they've begun to dig the foundation of the building and that process has started. So those plans just remain unchanged. It's a great time as other things slow down too, to be able to do construction. 
And as you know, I was a manager -- a program manager in development for a number of years. And you always -- as a program manager, you've got three big variables you're always managing that’s price and scope and cost scope in schedule. So -- and certainly we don't have -- we're not under the gun from a schedule standpoint. So we can optimize the other two things. So, roughly, we'll plan to finish that up somewhere around the end of 2021 or so, probably the 12 to 24 months from now, something like that. 
Vivek Arya 
Got it. And I know it wouldn't be a TI call unless I mention the magic words around free cash flow per share and free cash flow per share growth. May be give us a sense for how you are thinking about a dividend growth? TI has had a very solid record of among the best in the industry, not just in semi but I imagine in the S&P 500 as well. So how are you thinking about dividend growth and just kind of modulating buybacks given the pressure -- potential pressure on free cash flows this year?
Dave Pahl
Yes. And I think, you set it up very well for me to answer that question. I think as we act like owners and think like owners, we allocate capital, I mentioned earlier that our investments in things like R&D are remaining steady in this period, because those investments are on three and five year horizons. And as we look to grow free cash flow per share, three and five years from now, we want to have revenue growth. And so those investments are staying steady.
On the SG&A front, most of the SG&A goes to things that'll strengthen our competitive advantages whether that’s in the transitions to consignment or distribution strategy or investments in TI.com or virtual selling. So we want to keep those things steady and we'll be prudent and cut back where we can in more difficult times like this, but the other areas we want to continue those investments. 
CapEx we already talked about again our infrastructure investments to support growth longer term. So we want to have all those things still continuing, and that will serve us well with that longer term growth. And the cash that we have left over, we've got the commitment and we've got 15 plus or even longer track record now of returning all of that to our owners. And, the first priority is dividends and we'll look back and we'll look forward at what that free cash flow growth will look like. And make a decision of what to grow that dividend with and the priority there number one is sustainability. 
And we certainly -- I think our dividend last quarter was around, I have to check the math, it was somewhere between 50% to 60% of our trailing 12 months free cash flow. So certainly very sustainable. And so that's the first priority. And the second one is we want to have a dividend that will continue to grow. So, even if free cash flow is flat or down a little bit, we'd still like to grow it. That's what the objective is. And then the balance of the free cash flow we will return with buybacks. So that's basically how we think of it, and that hasn't changed. 
Vivek Arya
Great, very good. With that, we are at the end of our time. Thank you so much, Dave, for spending a little bit of your afternoon with us. Really appreciate your taking the time and thank you to the audience as well for joining us. If you have any follow-ups, please always feel free to call or write to me, but we'll close the session there. Thank you so much again, Dave. 
Dave Pahl
Thank you, Vivek. Take care. Bye, Bye.

Conference Call Participants
Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research
Stacy Rasgon
Good morning everyone. I'm Stacy Rasgon and I cover the U.S. Semiconductor space at Bernstein. Before we start today's session, I'd like to say a word on some of the logistics on how our interactive Q&A is going to work in particular. [Operator Instructions] You can submit questions for Rich and TI beginning right now and at any time during the presentation and we will leave time for Q&A at the end of meeting.
Also we're working with our partner Procensus to do live polling on the presentation after the session ends to get real-time investor feedback on sentiment for TI. A link to Procensus is also on the left of your screen. And again this will be a live poll with immediate access to the results for those that choose to submit. So, please take the 60 seconds on if you would to fill it out afterwards.
Now, that all of that is out of the way, I can't express what an honor it is to have our guest here joining us today Rich Templeton, Chairman, President, and CEO of Texas Instruments.
So, the multiyear transition story that is TI has been reaping tremendous benefits over probably the last decade if not more. The company was one of the first to recognize the futility of competing in wireless. And those exits while painful at the time freed up investments to grow the much more attractive businesses that make up the bulk of the portfolio today.
The company's 300-millimeter manufacturing strategy was originally looked on with astonishment frankly, but resulted in significantly lower CapEx and substantially higher free cash flow generation and they're doubling down on that today.
Gross margins have been on an upward trajectory for years as the benefits of the strategy has rolled through. And of course TI has through both words and deeds committed to return at least 100% if not more of that higher free cash flow which has been an attractive story for investors.
In my conversations with clients, obviously, the COVID situation has come up. Beyond the COVID though and macro situation, many of my conversations center on the structural case for further gross margin upside where margins could go from here given how far they've come, the sustainability of free cash flow generation, the effects of changes to the inventory and distribution strategy, what initial impacts the current geopolitical environment could have, and frankly, what the next leg of the story could be given the current playbook has already resonated and seems to be understood so well.
And so to give us some color on these and ideally many other topics it's my great pleasure to welcome Rich with us today. Thank you so much for being with us.
Rich Templeton
Stacy, it's a pleasure to be here. Thank you.
"
2020-05-28,Q&A," Session
Q - Stacy Rasgon
Yes. So, Rich in this format, I don't like to focus on the near term as much though given what's going on out there I don't think I can avoid it this time. But maybe before we dive into that more generally you've been at this a long time. You've seen many cycles in your career.
At least in my experience, this is my first pandemic-driven cycle. But overall maybe could you talk a little bit about what you think is the same versus different from what we're seeing now versus kind of a ""normal cycle""? And maybe talk a bit about some of the structural changes that TI has made over the years that's going to let you weather whatever is in store for us going forward?
Rich Templeton
Yes. Stacy we talked on the earnings call back in April that in many ways the best thing is to use the financial crash in 2008 to model or to think about things as we're working through that. And that's not a statement that this is going to be the same because it's my first pandemic as it is yours and many others. But it's at least a reasonable analogy of a significant disruption.
And I think we tried to be very clear. And that is the same ambitions that we've operated for years are going to drive our decisions today. We're going to act like owners that intend to own the company for the long-term. We're going to make sure that we can adapt and succeed in any environment that's changing.
And then finally and just as importantly, we're going to make sure we can be a company you're proud to be part of and one you'd be proud to have as a neighbor. And so I give those kind of higher-level ambitions because that's exactly how we're looking at things right now.
These are downturns or events that you've got to respect them. But there are also times where if you make wise investments if you spend your money in a smart way that we described even back on the earnings call I think great ground can be gained. And that's certainly where we're focused right now.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. So, to be clear on the financial crisis as a model we're using it as well. Although I guess what I'm hearing you say is you're using it because it's sort of the best that we have. But like there's no guarantee that it's the right model to use, but we're using it. That's kind of the view at this point?
Rich Templeton
Yes, I think that's accurate. I think we've said even on the April earnings call is that we're not trying to forecast the precise shape. We're not going to participate in the letter of the week or the shape of the swoosh or whatever people are going to try to decide. What we've looked at though is I think you can look back in time and you could make some smart decisions both in terms of how you operate the company from a plant loading and an inventory perspective. But you can also make some really smart decisions for how you invest money both for R&D or for SG&A or just as importantly the next leg of investment for capacity expansion on 300 millimeter.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Let's talk about that a little bit. So I mean, the current 300 millimeter strategy from my memory, I think, it was announced in September of 2009 so, like kind of on the tail-end of the financial crisis. And obviously, that decision that presumably was made in the middle of the financial crisis has paid enormous dividends.
As I sort of, think through and beyond the current pandemic, do you expect your current priorities to shift at all especially, as it relates to increasing levels or differentiation of investment or as it relates to cutting costs? Like how do you think about what we're seeing now might drive kind of future decisions along those lines?
Rich Templeton
Yes. So broadly in terms of investments and again, we mentioned this on the April call, R&D is essentially going to be unchanged because those are 5 and 10 year time horizon decisions. SG&A to the degree that we're investing for new capability, you mentioned in the brief overview of bringing more customers direct or changes to our distribution program or investments in ti.com, these aren't just a good time to make those investments, these are actually a wonderful time to where you can really accelerate and get ahead of people in terms of that.
Where you can save incremental cost on SG&A we'll certainly do that. But then when it comes to capital expenditures that's probably going to be mostly unchanged because most of what we're spending today is looking out at a 2022, 2023 timeframe for what that trend line of demand is going to be which is why we're moving forward with the Renner 2 or the RFAB 2 project to make sure that shell will be done and it will be available in that timeframe.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Thank you. I guess, in the near-term you've talked about -- again I hate to ask so tactically, but I mean, I'm getting questions on online as well. You talked about sort of, like order trends weakening in late March and April. We're through May now. Are you seeing any changes in May relative to what we saw in April versus your expectations when you had earnings? Any signs of green shoots from here? And again, this is a question that's coming in from the investors as well.
Rich Templeton
Yes. No, near-term questions are certainly understandable. But we're going to for today stick with what we talked about in April. And then when July -- in July when we get second quarter earnings out we'll give an update of how things have shaped through the quarter.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Okay. I'm going to ask you about your inventory and fab loading strategy. So I remember what happened in the financial crisis. Like many others, I mean, you guys have kind of tightened in -- in 2008 when things fell off a cliff. And you did kind of get caught by surprise by the demand snapback. As I recall your lead times went out to something like 30 weeks. My impression was always that that was part of what drove the 300 millimeter decision anyways you never wanted that to happen again.
So this time around you made the decision to continue running the factories mostly normally building inventories. We can talk about the broader inventory strategy in a moment. But in the wake of this you seem to be kind of looking at the view that if there is a demand snapback you would much rather be positioned to satisfy that and live with the risk if you're wrong. How do you think about, I guess, the potential downside if you're wrong versus the potential upside if you're correct in terms of building that inventory and running the factories where they are? How do you parse those decisions as you're making -- as you're trying to decide what to do in the wake of the current environment?
Rich Templeton
Stacy, I generalize two things. And I think you've commented on at least part of this. First is, it's our portfolio today very differently from what we were facing back in 2008 is much different in terms of the percent of our portfolio that are catalog parts they sell across multiple customers. So the confidence of the shelf life being very good on those is high. So it ends up giving you an amazingly asymmetric bet where the upside is huge and the downside is minimal. And it's not often in life that you get those so you certainly you want to take them when they present themselves.
But the other thing is even listen in the short-term and you pay far closer attention to all the different semiconductor companies through the earnings calls, but we were very well served with the inventory position that we consciously have built up in addition to a great business continuity plan and a great geographically diverse manufacturing footprint to where we worked our way through first quarter of 2020 in a pretty seamless way, compared to what I think was a pretty painful quarter for a bunch of our competitors.
And so this treatment of inventory bad is crazy. In fact, if you've got confidence in its long-term life in a period when customers are not going to be able to forecast what they need, okay, the company that can basically reach out to customers and say, do not worry the day you need something we'll have it for you, okay. We're just going to be served very well during that time frame whatever the shape of the recovery wants to look like as we go through it.
So we put a lot of thought into that. We've got a lot of detailed efforts behind it. We think it's serving us extraordinarily well now. And we think it's going to serve us well through the next couple of years as this economy tries to figure out what it wants to do.
Stacy Rasgon
Yeah, got it. And I guess to your credit, the company is in a good place right now where you don't have to worry about obsolescence of that inventory. I wouldn't say that everybody is in that same position. So…
Rich Templeton
There is no doubt. And I say that one compared to competitors, but two and even look at where we were back in 2008 and 2009, you couldn't take -- we were what 40% exposed to the baseband and the handset business with essentially custom parts. That is a very different game to play than the one we're in today.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Can you comment more broadly on just the overall inventory strategy? Because this is just as I said before this has not just been something you've done in response to COVID. You've been deliberately taking up your inventory over the last several years. You've been staging it closer to your customers over the last several years.
You've been staging it closer to your customers over the last several years and building out more stockpiles and everything else. Just how does all of that fit into -- where are you comfortable running? Maybe you can sort of review where your current targets are for inventory, and where those could even go on. I mean I'm not even necessarily convinced that those couldn't go higher over time.
Rich Templeton
Yeah. So I would -- before I go into the days of inventory number is go back to even some of your introductory comments about we've been moving in a direction to build closer direct relationships with our customers, because we believe over the long-term that is going to give us great advantages and allow us to win more business, because we'll be closer to them we'll know what they need and we can better service it and support it.
And so, you watched it over a number of years as we've moved in that direction. I think a year ago at this time, we were talking about this kind of next phase of consignment. Then back in the fall of 2019, we announced that we were narrowing down significantly the distribution channel. These are all steps in that direction. So, it's getting that inventory actually in one place, because it actually gives us even far more capability to be able to then aim at where the short-term demand is on that front.
So even though the ""days"" have been trending up, if you actually look at the absolute dollar amount of inventory, it's actually remaining amazingly stable. And you can't necessarily see the number that I'm about to describe, but we also look at it when we look through the channel, meaning not just TI balance sheet, but what has been held on the balance sheet of our distributors and we've been trying to bring that number.
And we have been bringing that number down. I think we mentioned on the earnings call, we've been decreasing it for seven quarters in a row or something like that. But, it's all about how we get that inventory in one place. We provide great service and support to our customers. And I think we're going to be highly rewarded for that over time.
Where does that lend itself to a days of inventory metric? We've got some background work we're doing on that right now. The historical days of inventory metric, I find rather uninteresting. It's maybe even dangerous because it tends to be a 90-day trailing. And it may tell you to do the wrong things at the wrong time. And obviously based on what we described, we were going to do in the second quarter, we're not letting that metric drive us to do things that aren't wise.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. I want to dig into the distribution strategy a little bit. Again this is something that I get a lot of questions on. And clients wonder what impact you pulled away from some of your distribution partners. People wonder what impact that might have. But at the same time, if you sort of look at it, as far as I -- you've been going along this path for a while. You've been moving customers more direct. You've been taking away the demand generation function from the disties. Or maybe if you could talk a little bit about like the overall evolution of the distribution strategy over the last several years.
And how are you -- I've always been surprised that you're actually able to actually handle that demand generation function on your own. Typically that's a big reason why the distributors in theory exist and you seem to be able to do that very well. Maybe just a little bit if you could on just the general evolution of the distribution strategy, consignment, everything else and like, and what impact that has on how you run the business today.
Rich Templeton
Yeah. I think the best way that -- it's how I think of it, it's how we have architected it is really go back to the discussion here from Dave and Rafael a lot about our four competitive -- or four sustainable competitive advantages of manufacturing and technology then a broad set of analog and embedded products then the broadest reach of our sales and marketing channels and then diversity and longevity.
And we really -- we don't believe that this discussion on competitive advantages as slides for Dave and Rafael to share during capital management, but it really is what we believe is how you fundamentally invest to build a very sustainable business model for the long term which is what -- lets you do the things that you described in the opening -- your opening speech.
So in many ways, the distribution changes are just part of think about investing in a strength or leveraging a strength. So we invested over a 6, 7-year period building out that applications and sales footprint, building out the capabilities of ti.com. And now we continue to not only build out that capability, but now we want to leverage it as well.
And the fact is, distributors have never been very good at creating demand. And we proved that just very clearly because we round down theoretical involvement by distributors 5, 6, 7 years ago. And not only did our share not go down, it's continued to go up. So I think it just comes back to -- it really proves that our view of where we're heading is the right one.
And these final changes of just really now pulling order fulfilment out of the channel, it's just something that we can do much more efficiently because we can have the inventory in one place we can ship and fulfil it quickly. And it's going to give us advantages.
And I actually believe these are advantages that -- and Stacy I think you know our competitors pretty well. These are advantages that are very difficult for our competitors to replicate because they don't have the reach of the sales channel, the breadth of the product capabilities, the ability to call on literally deep customer bases in the mass market. So that's what is really fascinating, it's really exciting to me. And it's going to continue to roll out quite nicely I think.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. That's helpful. If I sort of think forward like how that kind of like rolls out into the model I mean historically if you look at TI especially for a long time as you were exiting some fairly sizable noncore businesses like top line didn't grow much. All that is done, margins obviously went up a ton.
But it feels to me and please correct me if I'm wrong, does growth need to be more of a focus now just given where the margin structure is today? And I can look at some of the signs that would suggest that uptick in R&D, the inventory staging that we've talking about.
Has TI's focus on growth changed at all? Does the growth actually need to be more of an imperative maybe going forward than it was in the past just given where the margins have come over the last several years?
Rich Templeton
Yes. So Stacy and I forget I think you've done some of this math. The answer is this, funny yes, but no. And I'm not trying to be cute with that. What I mean is, if you actually look at the long-term growth of the Analog and Embedded business, you've been watching it consistently growing and in fact gaining share over the past pick, it 10, 12, 15 years.
And so when people say is growth more important, well, growth has always been important. But back to this top level view of we want to act like owners that are going to own the company for decades, we've really emphasized internally that our focus is on building a company stronger not just necessarily bigger. And if you build the company stronger and you aim it at the right markets size is a result not an objective unto itself.
Now, the reason I gave a slightly cute answer, if you look at the math, okay, certainly over the next 10 years, you're not going to get the same ""free cash flow margin lift"" that you got over the past half. And so to that degree as you've now got analog and embedded at 90-plus percent of the revenue, it's got to grow and that certainly has got to be the prime driver of long-term free cash flow per share.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Got it. Let's talk about those businesses. And in particular, I get a lot of questions quite often on the differences between the analog and the embedded businesses both in terms of margin structures and scale. And also some of that the more recent headwinds that have impacted the embedded processing business, because the growth hasn't been there, there's some reasons for that that we can talk about. But if you can maybe talk a little bit about like how you view the differences or not between those two businesses in terms of margin profile and growth? And maybe touch on some of the near-term headwinds that we've seen in embedded. I think the audience will find that helpful.
Rich Templeton
Yes. So, I think, there's a couple of things inside of that. I think you hear from Dave and you hear from Rafael very often when they get asked, what's the difference between analog and embedded. To me it's very different. It's very simple that they are different, and we don't sit around trying to figure out how to get the embedded business to the analog margin structure. The goal for that business is to simply grow and add value over time, and so we're not trying to push that margin structure to be identical on that front.
And we think that over the long-term just like it's been for the past 10 or 15 years, embedded it will certainly be able to do that. It had great growth in the pick a time frame kind of 2015, 2016 and 2017. You started seeing slowing of growth, because it had quite a bit of dependency in just a couple of areas during the end of 2018 and into 2019. And I think I've been extraordinarily direct with investors. And our job is to get that thing back on a long-term growth track and we think we're certainly going to be able to do that.
And so that's why we've got great confidence that it's going to add a lot of value to the business and it's a business that we want to have a part of our portfolio for the long-term. The analog business, I think has been doing amazingly well and consistently well. And it's even been growing quite well compared to our competitors even during the past couple of years, as we've been working through the consignment and now the distribution transition where clearly that's going to have some temporary headwinds on the revenue, but the team has actually been performing at or a little better than market, which is really pretty positive for what the indicators are for the longer-term.
Stacy Rasgon
I guess to follow-up on that, I mean, you've been a consistent analog share gainer, although, you typically talk about it as something like half a point a year or so maybe. I guess given these changes, do you think there's any reason to expect that that could potentially accelerate, or do you think that's still the right trajectory just given the product cycles that are – the length of the product cycles that are in this market?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I think it's – to me it's one of these things that if all we do over the next 10 years is gain at that rate. We're going to be happy as owners. That doesn't imply that that – that our objectives are stronger than that but I think you got to be just very careful of overstating or having bragging contest about the future as opposed to let history speak for itself.
I think the other thing that's embedded inside of it and to me it's a great aspect of the Analog business is as hard as it is to gain share that says something about the structure of the market and the moats to use that term of defensibility, which means it's difficult for competitors to take it away as well. So to me that's also a good statement for the robustness of the business model over the long term.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. And I guess, again to build on some of that like around the end markets. So obviously, you guys have focused on industrial and auto. I think you were one of the first to clearly articulate that strategy, although it is a widely adopted strategy at this point for many companies.
Can you review for us again how you think about the attractiveness of those markets versus where you were say 10 years ago, whether it's content or sustainability or barriers to entry or the long life and terminal value of those portfolios? Like what – like can you just review for us the rationale to be doubling down your efforts there?
Rich Templeton
Yes. Stacy you said it in the question. And I know you know it pretty well. And I just – I've watched this industry for a long enough period of time that over 10, 15-year periods end markets or select end markets tend to become the most important ones driving the semiconductor industry. And you can go back to mainframes, giving away to many computers, giving away to personal computers, giving away to personal electronics.
And I really believe when you sit back and look over the next, probably at least 10 and 15 years that the trends on content or semiconductor content growth, meaning dollars per system and what those dollars per system are going to do in the automotive applications and the broad set of end markets that are captured under industrial just say that they are going to be the most important semiconductor market's driving growth. And that doesn't mean that personal electronics are going away.
They're going to be with us for a long time. They're going to be large markets. We're going to be involved in them. We're going to be successful in them. But you really have to be well positioned in industrial and automotive to be in the right spaces over 10 or 15 years.
We do believe, we got lined up ahead of the industry on that by choice, our breadth of our product portfolio. If you then look inside to our breadth of process technologies and package technologies and you look at our road maps of what we're investing in, they really have the needs and careabouts of the automotive and the industrial market in mind. So think higher voltages and higher power, isolation, RF. Those types of things all really matter in that world. And we've been investing well for that.
In addition, our customer reach investments that we've already talked about. When you want to win in the industrial market, you need to be able to cost effectively get to 80,000 and 100,000 customers. And we're really the only semiconductor company poised to be able to do that. And I think it's going to be great to have on our side.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. I want to ask about one of the other markets, where I think your view has been maybe different from others. And so that's comm infrastructure particular 5G. So if I sort of put companies on a spectrum of how they view the potential of that market, you guys are for sure on one end of that spectrum on maybe on the less enthusiastic side of it. Could you maybe talk a little bit about like why and like what's sort of driving your view of 5G and maybe comm infrastructure worldwide? Because I do know it's a market where you are focusing less?
Rich Templeton
Well I try and use careful words on this Stacy. I think your characterization is accurate in terms of what the perception is. But we think the comm infrastructure market we think the 5G market is a wonderful market, okay? It's one we participate in. We certainly participate more with the Analog business, because we thought that was a really smart thing to do five and six years ago and I think it's proven to be pretty wide. The reason I think we get described as being at the weaker, the left-hand side of the distribution is that I just don't think over 10, 15 and 20 years, it's got a potential for secular growth, because capital spending by wireless operators is not going to go up. And if their capital spending is not going to go up, semiconductor content is not going to rise. And so to claim that, I just think is going to end up being a false promise. So we think it's an important market. It's a great market. We've got teams that are very good at it passionately involved in the thing and we like it. But we like it as one of the things that we do not the growth story or the primary driver of growth over the longer term.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Got it. Can you talk a little bit about your R&D strategy? I mean, this is another sort of interesting controversy. Sometimes people complain to me that they don't think you're spending enough, which is not something that I typically hear. People usually don't want to see companies spending more money in your case that comes up sometimes. How do you make the decision on how much to spend and where to invest and what the criteria? I mean you tend to run the company overall for free cash flow growth or free cash flow per share. Is that the primary metric that's going into like when you're making decisions on where and how much to invest?
Rich Templeton
It's certainly an end outcome for the long-term. But the biggest thing that we try to look at you and I have talked about this for years is there are other analog companies that spend more money as a percentage of revenue. They don't spend more than us on an absolute, okay? And certainly, we could go use some competitive filter and defend spending more. But I think the most important thing when you're ""allocating capital"" is to have a team of people that are really good at getting those investments to the best opportunities. And so I think one of the great disciplines that we have inside of our product line, and business unit, and SBE, our strategic business entity structure is that we've got leaders that are really good at knowing what the 10 projects are that people have thought about and then having the discipline to put the investment on the six best ones, as opposed to investing in everything.
And even though we could go defend it or explain it. And I think that that discipline has really allowed us to ""invest less as a percentage of revenue, yet we're gaining market share compared to these competitors that are spending a higher percentage."" So I think that discipline goes to many of the things that Dave and Rafael will talk about on capital management. We live it and breathe it on a daily basis and I think it's going to continue to help us going forward.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Thank you. I want to ask a little bit about China, just given some of the geopolitical things that are popping up now. First of all, around the Huawei restrictions. What did you see with the prior Huawei restrictions? How much are you shipping to Huawei now, versus what you were shipping two years ago? And what impact, if any, do you think like some of the new restrictions on Huawei are going to have for you?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I don't have that specific data. I am going to guess it's down in general, but only because of some of the lumpiness of how things looked a couple of years back on that front. In general, I think, I mentioned, Stacy, when we talked even a year ago, I would far prefer to see both the leaders in the U.S. and the leaders in China figuring out how to grow the collective GDPs of the country.
I think it would do better things. But I'm not going to have influence on that decision. The approach we take internally is very simple and that is the environment is the same for us as it is for all our competitors and now go do a better job taking care of the customers and meeting their needs. And we really try to keep things that simple.
Stacy Rasgon
Okay. Do you see any potential impact from the new Commerce Department restrictions?
Rich Templeton
I think, we've -- I'm careful on that, because there's been a recent new set. I don't think -- depending on the set you're referencing, I don't think they're going to have a big impact for what we do. But I give a very careful answer on that. There's always activity inside the U.S. government. I don't always know what all those things are, obviously.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. A question from the folks on the line here, also around China. They want to know, like, how your share is trending in China. I think some of it has to do with potential blowback against U.S. suppliers. There's also the question dropping WPG as a distributor. Did that impact your China share at all?
Rich Templeton
Yes. My general guess is, we're more than holding our own and I say that carefully. You heard Dave, I think, on every earnings call, when he's asked for the geographical breakdown of revenue. He gives the cautionary statement that that's where revenue shifts to, as opposed to where it's designed or necessarily consumed on that front.
But, no, I think, even with the trade tensions, we're holding up really quite well. And relative to the distribution comment, in general, we've been working through, as I mentioned before, the design win change and the order fulfillment change. And these distribution changes are going to have zero impact in terms of what our customer positions look like in the long term.
And the fact is, we're in a really good place right now, as our strategies in terms of higher availability of product, keeping our lead times short, making the investments in inventory, continuity plans, BCP plans, geographically diverse manufacturing have led us really function pretty well through the current environment, which I think is going to continue to help us independent of the distribution channel.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. Thank you. I want to ask about the 300 – the new 300-millimeter strategy. So I know you've been – you were building a new factory. I think – I don't know, if you maybe completed it, but you're working on the parking structure first. What is the current time line for when you might expect production out of that fab? Admittedly, I know with COVID throwing a little bit of monkey wrench into things in the near-term. Once it's here though you expect that the cost savings potential of that to be similar to the prior 300-millimeter even though this was going to have a higher percentage of new tools rather than used tools? Like, how do we think about the margin evolution potential of this as this starts to ramping over time?
Rich Templeton
Yeah. So, we've got the – the parking garage is done now and what – what's important on that is where the new fab is going to go with the old parking lot. So one had to get done before the other. So that is done. They'll be moving – they'll be breaking ground literally any week now in terms of things of getting that new shell in place. And then the intention is to have that thing done and ready to be occupied by the end of 2021.
And Stacy, with your background, I think you can appreciate this probably as well or better than any analysts, the real beauty of having that thing literally connected to our fab, one is that it allows us to expand with a very fine grain or small granularity. Meaning, if you start up a clean field site, as you know you might have to go tool a-third of that facility from a capital point of view, and get a team of pick a number 300 or 400 people in place to be able to even operate anything. Well, the beauty about being next door to Renner is you can actually make very small incremental decisions on capacity expansion, and just literally be layering equipment in and adding people as you need it with that new facility. So it's really going to serve us quite well in a world, where who knows what the ramp-up will look like.
And then lastly, on the question of fall-through, even though we're assuming a higher percentage of the equipment is new, the real beauty about 300-millimeter is the wafer diameter not do you get it at $0.10 on the dollar or you're paying a dollar for a dollar. And just go do the math. These wafer fabs are going to operate 30- 40-plus years. And it just makes the – is it nicer to be able to buy the stuff at $0.10 on the dollar? Sure. But it's – the cost benefits are all about the wafer diameter. So we're going to be very happy with that.
Stacy Rasgon
I guess that makes sense. If you're using it for 40 years, you could appreciate it getting five. For the bulk of its lifetime, it's going to be depreciated anyways whether it's new or whether it's used.
Rich Templeton
It certainly is. And when we talk about the fact on a 300-millimeter wafer you basically can get a 40% cost reduction on the same equivalent die that would be built on a 200-millimeter wafer. And we've also made this subtle comment, but it's not a small one, that puts aside the advantage you get on any chip scale packaging which is a growing percentage of the business. And certainly, we get the benefits of that.
Stacy Rasgon
I see. That makes sense. I want to ask a question. This is a topic that's coming up a lot broadly with my clients on ESG. Can you talk a little about your corporate responsibility strategy? And like, what are the material ESG issues? What are the risks or opportunities that you've identified in your business? Like, how do you think about ESG investing on, as it relates to TI?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I think what's -- and I don't know, if we're different with this, but it really is the heart of how I think about it. We as a company, the Board is, it really goes to the heart of some of my opening comments. And that is, we have a set of ambitions that is how we've run this company literally for decades now. I mentioned them earlier. Act like an owner, act like an owner that's going to own a place for decades, be able to adapt and succeed in a world that's always changing and be a company you can be proud to be part of and proud to have as a neighbor.
And we really have that set of ambitions and a set of values that go along with that. And it's how we run the company. And it's not separate from how do we talk to the ESG people; it's how we run the company. And I think that is really the real intent behind the ESG activities on a broader basis is making sure that you're doing good things that when you execute well, not only do your employees win, not only do your communities win, not only do your customers and suppliers win, but your investors win as well. And I think, if you look at us over the long term, you've seen great consistency in that. You can see it today in the material that we talk about internally as well as externally. And I think it serves us well.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. So Rich, we have about one minute left. So, I'm going to finish this up the way I always do. I'm going to give you your soapbox. Especially maybe for investors who are not owners at this point, why should they be? Why should investors buy Texas Instruments stock here?
Rich Templeton
Well, I'll give you the same answer I give you any other time you give me the soapbox. And that is because we're going to act like owners and we're going to operate the place like we're going to be owners for decades to come. And if we do that, well, I think potential investors will find participating with us beneficial.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. That's wonderful. For everybody on the line, I want to remind you again we are doing live polling with our partner Procensus. If you could at least click on the link on the left side the Procensus link, you'll see a new window open up with a very short poll, will take you about 60 seconds and you'll benefit from real-time tracking of investor sentiment on TI. With that, I think we're going to close today's session. Rich -- sorry about that. Rich thank you so much for being with us today. Really appreciate it.
Rich Templeton
Stacy, thank you and your insight. Appreciate everybody participating today and everybody stay safe.
Stacy Rasgon
You too. You too take care.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Texas Instruments first quarter 2020 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to hand things over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Given the likelihood of a significant economic recession due to COVID-19, we are changing the format for this quarter's earnings call. In addition to Rafael Lizardi, our CFO, we will be joined by Rich Templeton, our Chairman and CEO. Rich will be covering a broader frame of how we are approaching the current environment. I will then provide a summary of first quarter and Rafael wrap up with the financial details of first quarter and our outlook for second quarter. Our prepared remarks will be longer than usual as we hope to cover a range of anticipated questions.
Let me turn it over to Rich.
Rich Templeton
Thanks Dave. At the highest level, to understand how we will approach a likely significant recession resulting from COVID-19, I remind you of the three ambitions that for decades have driven all decisions inside of TI. These ambitions are, first, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades, second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing and third, we will be a company that you are proud to be part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor.
When we pursue these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit. These guiding ambitions have served us well for decades, but they are enormously valuable in these times because they help simplify many decisions in an uncertain environment.
Like many companies in the COVID-19 crisis, we have acted aggressively keeping our people safe and able to support their families. We have kept operations running to support our customers with special emphasis on our medical customers. And in the communities where we operate around the world, we have provided direct financial support and medical supplies to provide some relief. The list of action is lengthy.
So starting with the economic framework. No two economic recessions are identical, but the 2008 financial crisis provides us the most recent significant recession and therefore is the best example to study and inform decisions on operating plans, revenue forecast and investment and spending plans. As a reminder, if you look back to 2008 and specifically to September 2008, all new orders turned off overnight. This led to a 26% sequential drop of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008, an additional 16% sequential decline in the first quarter of 2009 and then a rapid snapback for the next six quarters. By the second quarter of 2010 or within two years of the start of the sharp decline, revenue moved back above the level of the third quarter of 2008.
With the benefit of hindsight, our customers overcorrected to the downside and we then spent a year-and-a-half chasing back up to support demand. With this in mind, we are not trying to predict this economic recession and recovery, but instead we want to ensure that we have the highest degree of optionality so that we can deal successfully with any outcome.
Therefore, regarding our operating plan, looking at the patterns from pre and post 2008 and the second quarter of 2020 and quite likely the third quarter of 2020, we will be running our factories at about the level they ran in the first quarter of 2020. This will likely result in an increase in inventory during the second quarter but this will be important to support our customers during a time when they have limited ability to forecast. Our product portfolio of primarily long-lived products makes this an easy decision and maximizes our optionality.
Regarding second quarter revenue guidance, Rafael will elaborate in a minute, with reduced visibility of customer demand, we have used the historical transitions that I mentioned from 2008 and adjusted for seasonality. We are not implying precision but explaining the assumptions. We are using an expanded range to account for the current uncertainty.
Regarding spending and investments. First, research and development spending will be essentially unchanged as these are five to 10-year time horizon decisions. We will continue to make ongoing portfolio adjustments but these are unlikely to make meaningful changes to investment levels.
On SG&A, we will maintain critical investments in new capabilities, such as strengthening ti.com because these are important times to gain ground. Where we can minimize expense, we are and we will certainly continue to do so.
On capital spending, our plans are generally unchanged because the bulk of capital spending is driven by roadmap capacity needs in the 2022 to 2025 time frame. We will continue with previously announced construction plans that are underway for the next generation 300 millimeter analog wafer fab in Richardson, Texas.
Lastly, regarding how we are operating in the current environment. We were fortunately prepared for the unforeseen disruptions that COVID-19 has presented. We updated our customers in late March that our lead times remain short and unchanged and that we could respond to short term demand. This is because we invested in inventory, have robust business continuity plan and invested in geographically diverse internal manufacturing footprint.
Our manufacturing teams are operating throughout the world, including countries like Malaysia and the Philippines, where local restrictions have resulted in partial operations. We have adopted protocols quickly to keep our people safe and minimize any disruptions. Our team was prepared and is comfortable getting our work done remotely. We continue to actively work new design wins with customers via virtual selling processes that we instituted several years ago.
On most days across TI, we are averaging a peak of 10,000 VPN connections and two million meeting minutes per day, about four times higher than normal. We all look forward to things getting back to normal, but in the meantime we are focused on execution.
Let me hand things back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Rich. I will provide some standard comments of first quarter revenue by end market and then I will add some additional insight about the quarter in light of COVID-19.
First, for highlights on first quarter revenue by end market versus a year ago. Industrial increased mid single digit from a year ago quarter and it improved compared to fourth quarter. Automotive declined mid single digits and decelerated in the quarter as our customers' factory shutdowns impacted demand. Personal electronics declined mid single digits, but by sector was a mixed bag. Mobile phones declined low double digits, while by contrast PCs increased low double digits. Communications equipment declined about 50% as expected due to a comparison against a very strong first quarter 2019. Communications was up sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems increased double digits on strong data center demand.
For additional insight, the first quarter ran as expected into Chinese New Year, but was slow coming out of the holiday as Chinese factories struggled to come back due to COVID-19. In early March, we saw a pickup in orders from most markets as supply chain disruptions led to increased customer concerns about being able to secure supply.
This increase in demand that we experienced in March had continued into early April with the exception of automotive as manufacturers' plant closures reduced consumption. This increase in orders has steadily abated in April but returned to levels we saw in early March. The midpoint of our range assumes that this decline continues through the quarter as customers have reduced visibility to end-demand.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Revenue was $3.3 billion, down 7% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 20 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $794 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 23% of revenue. Over the last twelve months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D. Operating profit was $1.2 billion or 37% of revenue. Operating profit was down 10% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.2 billion, or $1.24 per share, which included a $0.10 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $851 million in the quarter. As a reminder, first quarter is typically the seasonally low point for cash flow from operations due to payout of profit sharing and bonuses. Capital expenditures were $161 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.6 billion.
In the quarter, we paid $841 million in dividends and repurchased $1.6 billion of our stock for a total return to owners of $2.5 billion. In total, we have returned $6.6 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 55% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.7 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the first quarter. In the quarter, we issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 1.375% due in five years. This resulted in total debt of $6.6 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.81%. Since then, we have repaid $500 million of debt due in second quarter and we have no further debt due this year. We have $550 million of debt due in 2021.
Regarding inventory, TI inventory dollars were flat to fourth quarter and days were 145. Distribution-owned inventory declined again in first quarter by about $50 million, the sixth consecutive quarter of planned reductions, as we continued the transition of our channel to have fewer distributors and bring more customers direct. We had about four weeks of distribution inventory, the lowest since third quarter of 2017. Tactically and strategically, we are very pleased. We have steadily decreased total inventory dollars while increasing the percent of inventory concentrated inside TI and therefore in fewer places. This enables us to maintain short lead times and high availability, which is critically important in an environment where end demand visibility for our customers will be limited.
With a recession likely upon us, as Rich mentioned earlier, we are using the 2008 financial crisis to inform our second quarter outlook. To reflect the increased uncertainty, we have also expanded the range. For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.61 billion to $3.19 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $1.04.
Regarding our operating plan for running our factories, we expect that customers in this recession, similar to past recessions, will overcorrect in the short term as their visibility of their end demand drops. We believe it will be an important advantage to maintain consistent lead times and to offer customers high levels of product availability. Our product portfolio of mostly long-lived parts affords us to have a steady hand. Therefore, we will be running our factories in second quarter at approximately the same level we ran them in first quarter of 2020. TI inventory will likely grow during the second quarter, while distributor-owned inventory will likely drain.
In closing, we continue to invest in our competitive advantages in making our business stronger. History has shown us that in times like this, is when we can make the most strategic progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. And after our response, we will provide you an opportunity for a follow-up. Operator?
"
2020-04-21,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question today from Vivek Arya, Bank of America.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, I understand visibility is low and I understand the way you are predicting Q2. But just a few weeks into Q2, have your orders or bookings played out the same way as it did during the financial crisis? Does your consignment program now provide you better visibility than last time? I am just curious what you have actually seen so far in the quarter so that we can get a better handle on the outlook that you giving?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So let me, I will start and Dave, you want to chime in on that. But as we have said in the remarks, April has, in fact, behaved very differently than 2008 in the comparison, not only April but March. March was strong coming out of Chinese New Year. As we said in the prepared remarks, we came out a little slowly but then things strengthened and into April the things have abated in the second half of April. But we think that is due to the concern that many customers have on supply disruptions.
So our range and particularly the midpoint of our range implies an expectation that demand will drop as customers internalize better their end demand and frankly they are going to have very low visibility. We expect them to have very low visibly of demand. That's why the important point here is that we are keeping high optionality throughout this process, so that if things snapback, we can support that. We can support that on the other side of this.
Dave?
Dave Pahl
I think that's well said. Do you have a follow-on to that?
Vivek Arya
Yes. Thank you. You mentioned that you are continuing to run your factory loadings in Q2 at the same level as Q1. I am curious if you can give us some color around what your modeling days of inventory to be exiting Q2? Is there a certain maximum limit to the amount of inventory or in terms of days or dollars that you willing to build before you have to start taking actions?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Thanks for that question. so Vivek, just as you framed them, I am glad you framed it that way, it is a capital allocation decision. So we are allocating capital in the form of inventory. Capital is going to go into inventory instead of going to other places and the inventory will increase, we expect very likely to increase into second quarter. But that's what gives us the optionality that I mentioned, having that inventory on hand. The key thing to remember and you know it very well, the vast majority of our products are long-lived. They are highly diverse. They sell to many, many customers. They live a long time on the shelf and the customers' product lifecycle are very long. So that inventory will not go back. So it's an option. We have a fairly low-cost upfront to have that option.
Dave Pahl
That's great. Thank you Vivek. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Next up, we will hear from Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, if I go back to 2008, I think the decline was a lot quicker. But if I look Q3 2008 peak to Q1 2009 trough, revenues fell about 40%. This cycle has been longer, but if I take maybe the peak was Q3 2018 to your guide in Q2 2020, you would be down about 30%. So that suggests that maybe there is still a little more to go for following the same kind of trajectory? And I guess, also if the decline from peak to trough is longer, does that suggest that you might be thinking about the increase off the peak also being longer? Like how do we compare the two situations?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So I will take --
Rich Templeton
Stacy, this is Rich. Given the recollection of 2008, I would be careful of too much precision in where you are trying to draw that to. I do think that valid comparison and I think you know this very well from the history, is that 2008 was a reasonably, 2007 and first half of 2008 were reasonably hot semiconductor markets. It's not overheated, but pretty hot. And clearly 2019 and the first quarter 2020, we are cooler compared to the heat of 2017 and 2018. So when you try to get peak to trough, that's a little more complex. We just tried to basically look through what did we think demand was doing for a couple of years prior and that was what helped inform and help set where we put the operating plans.
Stacy Rasgon
Got it. For my follow-up, I know you generally don't have tons of visibility into what true end demand is doing. But do you any way to gauge just given the amount of pull forward that we might be seeing right now whether it's gauging the pace of rush orders or anything like that? Is there anything that you can give us to try to gauge how much of the strong near term demand might be pull forward versus anything else?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Stacy, as you would imagine, I don't think we have any precision on that. I think as we saw after Chinese New Year is that we saw strength. We believe that that was due to the customer concerns. It's hard to have any precision around what percentage of that was due to that concern with any degree of accuracy.
But, yes, Rafael, you want to add to that?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I agree. The only thing I would add is that we know, is the channel is clean, the district channel, because as we said, we are four weeks, we drained about $50 million on the channel and we plan to continue draining for the next three quarters or so about another $200 million or so plain drain as we convert more and more customers to go in direct. So the channel, we know is clean and will continue to be clean. But as Dave alluded to, we really don't know the end customers when they pull, how much of that is true end demand versus stocking up for potential disruption.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And I might add too that, as you know Stacy, 65%, 70% of our revenue is on consignment. So we are not turning backlog but we see plans that are in our customer' factories. But as they have reduced visibility, all those plans are not updated. So they are being updated slowly, as they are deciding what to build in those factories. So those updated plans are rolling through and that's what's creating the uncertainty as you would imagine.
Okay. Thank you Stacy. And we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Next up from Morgan Stanley is Craig Hettenbach.
Craig Hettenbach
Yes. Thank you. I appreciate the color on the OpEx side of things. Any additional thoughts around just kind of variable compensation? And as revenue comes, some mitigation in terms of EPS impact over the next couple of quarters?
Rafael Lizardi
Sure. So as we said in the prepared remarks, in general, OpEx will be relatively unchanged. So R&D, those are long term investment. SG&A, we also have some investment areas there with ti.com. In other places, we frankly run the company pretty tightly to begin with but wherever we can tighten them more, we do.
On your specific question on variable compensation. That tends to be a profit-sharing and bonus. Profit sharing moves according to a formula, so it's very formulaic. So depending on what happens, that adjusts. And bonuses is determined by the Board depending on routing performance on one to three years on several metrics.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-on, Craig?
Craig Hettenbach
I do. Thanks. And understanding the different cadence by geography in terms of China was weak, then came back and Europe and North America maybe weaker now. But would just love to get your thoughts just for Q2 how you are expecting kind of things within your guidance from a geographic perspective?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I always give caution when asked about geographical revenue. Sometimes we can see distinct patterns, but where we ship our product is rarely where it's actually consumed, as you know. So we ship a product that ends up in a phone built in China, it may end up but in Europe. So if there was something distinct in our guidance that was impacted by geography, we would share that. And we don't have anything specific to share with that right now.
But thank you Craig. And we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question is Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
Hi guys. Thanks for all these additional details, especially with Rich on the line. Maybe one for Rich. In your comments earlier, you said you wanted to use 2008 as a template and that is about as fair a template as I could imagine as well. You also laid out about how the pattern was a steep fall, then a steep rise back. Given that you are behaving, your actions are very different this time where you are keeping utilization flat, et cetera, is that because you view this cycle as being any different, short duration matching the same one as a decade ago? Or is it simply just the optionality side of the equation at the end of the day that you are trying to maintain?
Dave Pahl
Let me have Rafael.
Rich Templeton
Ross, just to help on that, I think Rafael covered this in some ways. If you think back to 2008 and you know and a bunch of folks know, we were very much different. We had a large wireless business. We had portfolio re-profiling we had to do. We have had a high percentage of our product that wasn't exactly custom, but it behaved a lot like custom. So building inventory was a much more difficult game. And the beauty about where we are today is, as Rafael pointed out, is that a high percentage of the portfolio is long-lived products. We have got our R&D and our resources well deployed in the areas that we want to be long term. And that's what really puts us in the wonderful position where the cost to have maximum optionality is actually pretty low on our particular case in 2020 versus where it was back in October 2008.
Ross Seymore
Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess as my follow-up, just switching over to the cash return side of the equation. It looks like you guys had pretty much the second biggest buyback in a single quarter you have had in a decade. Can you just remind us on how you guys are thinking about the ability to return cash? I know your long term policy of returning 100% of your free cash flow and it's not just dictated by any single quarter. I appreciate that as well. But this was significantly above what you guys generated in a single quarter and maybe even in a couple of quarters of free cash flow. So just talk about how much leverage you are willing to put on the balance sheet to take advantage opportunistically of a pullback in your stock when it's below what I guess you view to be your intrinsic value?
Rafael Lizardi
Sure. So let me first, you alluded to it but let me just remind everybody on the call, that our objective when it comes to cash return is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that through buybacks and dividends. So for example, on a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $5.6 billion of free cash and we returned $6.6 billion. So obviously all free cash flow there have been returned.
And then you mentioned debt and we have debt on their balance sheet as we said on the call, $6.6 billion, we finished. On a net basis, it is $1.8 billion because we have $4.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet. But we use debt to increase the rates of return with some leverage when it makes sense. So that's how we view the returns and the debt for many, many years, as we have talked about on capital management.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Ross. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Next up is John Pitzer, Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, I just want to go back to your comments in your prepared remarks about booking swelling as we have been coming to the end of April. Was there any end market distinction you can talk about? And I am particularly interested in kind of understanding how auto and industrial is behaving at the beginning this pandemic versus maybe things like PC, data center and comms?
Dave Pahl
Yes. John, I would say that when we looked at the last quarter, it was very distinct but we saw strength. We saw strength in PCs. We saw strength in data center. We saw a distinct slowing in auto as we as we talked about. I would say that the relative strengths in orders that we saw in the quarter that happened in March and continued into April was broad-based generally and was across the board with the exception of auto. And then the slowing, I would say that it is also broad-based.
You have a follow-on?
John Pitzer
Yes. Just as my follow-on, returning to Ross' question about capital allocation and return. Rich, since you are on the call, you guys have always been good at sort of zagging what everybody else is zigging and you have got a longer duration out there. I am kind of curious about how you are viewing the current environment relative to M&A? And is that sort of an arrow in your strategic quiver as we go through the next couple of quarters, much clear then when you were in recession?
Rich Templeton
John, if you think about it and you can even, you have watched us for a long time. You can go back to 2008 and then look at what we did through 2009, 2010, 2011 and such. And clearly if you think about capital allocation, the things that I stepped through, keeping on the right R&D investments, keeping out the right capital expenditures, making the right capability investments on things like ti.com, that's where you get just very excited about. We will be getting stronger during this period and those strengths will help us even as the secular trends of more semiconductors in your life are growing.
To the degree that we have an opportunity to buy used equipment or used factories or potentially M&A, as with anything on capital allocation. I think that one just goes down to the it depends type comment, meaning it would have to be probably a more prolonged downturn. If you think about what the mood was in 2009, 2010 and 2011, that mood had to be there for a while before opportunities became available. But we are certainly, we try to just be wise over the long term.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you John. We will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And we will go to Chris Danley, Citigroup.
Chris Danley
Hi. Thanks guys. And Rich, thanks for making the cameo. My first question. Rich, do you think or do you anticipate any longer term structural changes in the business, either in terms of end markets or anything you are looking at as a result of this pandemic?
Rich Templeton
Chris, I think it's early. I think I know your world tries to get ahead on trying to guess what will happen, I, in general, think that the secular trends that we have seen with semiconductors and more semiconductors coming into people's lives, are going to continue, okay. And I think somewhat as John alluded to in his question, it's obvious in the near term, but server sales and PCs are going to do well as working from home continues. But I just think longer term you look at industrial products, industrial equipment and even automotive, even though on the near term people will see SAAR numbers come down. The secular trend on semiconductor growth inside of automotive is going to make it a great market to be in for the long term.
So no, I don't think from that point there will be a big structural change. I do think we have got a great advantage of having structural channel advantage. So the changes that we have been working towards for a number of years of building closer, direct relationship with customers, things that you now see playing out with a higher and higher percentage of inventory being in our hands to where we can be more efficient, that's going to be a fantastic trend and TI is well prepared to take advantage of that with our breadth of channel reach through the industry.
Chris Danley
Thanks. So I can follow-up?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Sure. Go for it, Chris.
Chris Danley
Okay. Thanks. And then Rich, to the extent you can, if you could give us any insight into what the customer conversations are like? What are they asking? What are their big concerns? And I guess at the root of it, you guys talked about and I thought about this, why aren't we seeing this sort of fall off in orders yet? Has everybody just kind of frozen in place out there? Why is that happening?
Rich Templeton
Chris, I think if you and Dave, I thought was very direct with what he described as we saw orders rise, starting to peak at first, second week of March. You saw them rise up. You have seen them start trend down. They are still at that level we saw approximately ending February and in early March. I think that's starting to filter through. For us, especially, Dave will have the number where we are 60%, 70% consignment. It takes a while for those consignment feeds to really get updated because companies have got to start getting better numbers on that front. So I think customers are just still processing through what their customers are telling them and we will see that play through. It's why we have made the assumption that May would be down from the April and June down versus April as well for the range.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Chris. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Next up is Tore Svanberg, Stifel.
Tore Svanberg
Yes. Thank you. And I appreciate the wide range of the guidance in this environment. But can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what the assumptions are sort of at the low end and at the high end of the range?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So I will give you my take. Frankly there is no science on that. As we talked about earlier, we are using 2008 as the model for that. Again, it doesn't imply precision, not even similarity. It's just that it's the most recent exogenous event that we can use. So we are using that. And the midpoint is the closest thing to that adjusted for seasonality. What you normally would see on our first, second quarter transition, now you are seeing a negative 13% at that midpoint. But the entire range and the other reason we widened or the reason we widened the range is to reflect the great level of uncertainty that we have going on.
As Rich mentioned, many customers, right now they are still processing what's happening and we have actually heard some of them haven't been able to update their feeds to us, right. So they have got to go through all that process. And so that's embedded in that wide range. The biggest point I want to make and we made it a couple of times already is the optionality that we are going to get based on how we are running the factories, right.
So this thing can go multiple ways for second quarter and third quarter and beyond. But we have just great optionality the way we are running the business, both strategically, the type of parts we build and the end product and so forth. But tactically, the way we are running the factories and inventory in second quarter.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg
Yes. Thank you Dave. The other question goes back to what you just mentioned there. So I am sure your customers are probably thinking about this too and maybe they are perhaps building some inventory too to be able to respond to an eventual demand. If that should be the case, how long would you be willing to have this optionality or perhaps run the inventories a little bit longer than normal?
Rafael Lizardi
You know, it's going to depend on a number of factors that today we don't know, right. And I think we and the world and the industry will learn over the coming weeks and months and then we will adjust an unnecessary. I think the advantage we have with the way we are set up strategically, with the type of parts we build and the type of customers we have and the type of end markets is that we can afford to have this optionality, right. These parts are not going to go bad. It is very different in a custom part centric world in personal electronics type of centric world. That's not the case with the way we structured in the company. So we have great optionality to go through this beyond second quarter.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Tore. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
And next from BMO is Ambrish Srivastava.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thank you. Rich, good to hear your voice. I am sure that nobody really wanted to hear you at this kind of a forum. I had a question back on capital allocation and going back to the 2008, 2009 template or playbook. You raised the dividend in the fourth quarter, back then it was a small person, but it was on a percentage basis was pretty meaningful. So as we compare where we are heading now versus I am sure nobody had any idea what next quarter was going to be, what's the right way to think about capital allocation? Based on the comments you and Dave and Rafael are making, it sounds like no change in 100% free cash flow back, divvy plus buyback, no change to that. So just kind of help us understand the thinking or scenarios that you are playing out that you are thinking through which might lead to a near term modification on that, Rich? And then I have a follow-up.
Rich Templeton
Yes. So I will set up and I will let Rafael cover it. The answer is, no change, Ambrish, because we really have tried to have a very thoughtful long term plan. But I think it's helpful for Rafael to summarize some of those plans.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So just to comment and Ambrish, as you said and Rich just confirmed that, yes, there is change in the way we think of our capital management and our long term objectives. So as I said earlier, cash return, return all free cash flow. On dividend specifically, as you alluded to, the objective is provide a sustainable and growing dividend to appeal to a broader set of owners. And as a reminder, on a trailing 12-month basis, our dividend was a 55% of our free cash flow now. Of course, as a backwards-looking metric, I understand that. But it's great place to start. Frankly, few companies are at that level in our industry and in the S&P 500. So it's a great place to start. But that objective of providing a sustainable and growing dividend, it has been and continues to be very important for us.
Dave Pahl
Follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes, I did and this is more to do, I think Chris asked a good question on structural changes. Given that we are working from home, at least those of us who can afford to work from home, how is it impacting the design activity that TI engages in, in multiple geos, multiple customers, so many end markets? What's the right way to think about the changes that you are seeing there? And odes it portend poorly for when we ultimately get to a more ""normal world""?
Rich Templeton
Ambrish, it's why we included in my remarks comments about how we are operating and it's one of these deals produced an update for internal. And basically, I had a bunch of people telling me, gosh, we got lucky on some things. And I explained, there is this great quote that, luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. And we put in place this mass-market selling, really virtual selling techniques starting three years ago. It's an instituted standard process. Our sales teams work at applications, people work at comfortable with customers. And so it's almost been like nothing has changed in terms of where we spend our time working between ourselves and the customers. They all want to do it on the phone anyhow. Our products group connecting in on that.
So the readiness that we had to operate in this world is actually enormously high. Having ti.com more capable to support customers' decisions to be able to support online commerce as we are bringing more customers direct, the comfort of our product groups, design engineers and people to work collaboratively because we have always had to do that is really very unchanged. I do think people are working more hours just because the days and hours tend to blend into one another, as I am sure everybody on this call is experiencing. But it's very impressive to watch the team performing and watching what it's getting done. We are even at that point where all the set of customer visits even next week where those customer visits will be virtual as well. So we are just well into the way of operating this way.
Rafael Lizardi
I just want to comment on a slightly different topic, but related in the spirit of preparation meeting opportunity. I just want to highlight and we talked about it during the prepared remarks, but we were prepared for the unforeseen disruptions with a combination of our inventory strategy, our business continuity program and our geographically diverse manufacturing footprint, which of course is part of our one of our competitive advantages of manufacturing and technology. So we have in all of those together, we were able and continue to be able to provide our customers with short lead times and inventory availability in this time when they need it most, not now and the coming of quarters when their visibility will be impaired.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And I would say that we have had customers actually contact us and they are rather surprised that our lead times are stable and they can get the product that they need. So they are very happy with that.
So thank you, Ambrish. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
And next is Harlan Sur, JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and appreciate the additional commentary and Rich being on the call today. I know you guys don't like to talk about sort of specific geographies. But fact of the matter is, China is coming out of this pandemic and starting to open up their economy and throwing quite a bit of stimulus at it. Are you seeing this being reflected in your order rates or consignment forecast for your domestic China customers? And roughly what percentage of your business today comes from domestic China consumption?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I will start and please chime in, Rafael, if you would like. So again I will give the numbers of products of where we actually ship the product but always offer the caution that it's where the box ships from. So we have got 50% of our product ships into China. But again, like you know, cellular phones as an example may be built there, may be designed in California and end up in Europe as an example. And yes, we are seeing those factories coming back online as we talked about in our prepared remarks. Yet, I think the uncertainty is how much demand will actually be there as those factories come back online. And I think that that's what's creating that uncertainty.
So do you have follow-on?
Harlan Sur
Yes. Thank you for that. So IHS in its most recent forecast is calling for global little vehicle production to drop almost 20% this year. This is twice the year-over-year drop as experienced in the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. Outside maybe just the near term inventory correction to kind of normalize to the lower production trends, how is the TI team thinking about your content growth in auto to potentially partially offset significant decline in production this year?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think Harlan, I will make a couple of comments and Rich, if you want to jump in afterwards, feel free to. And I think that what's important for us is just the longer term opportunity in automotive remains unchanged. And we continue to invest in five different sectors inside of automotive. There will be more content per vehicle, as you know, Harlan, as you are pointing to. We will respond tactically to those changes in demand and we know how to do that and take care that operationally. That's not something that we will be able to control, but we will keep our investments steady and be prepared to support that growing opportunity as it arrives.
So Rich, you have anything to add to that?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I would just, Harlan, amplify as I suggested earlier that the secular growth theme that are embedded in things like automotive or embedded in industrial are alive and well, okay. They are going to be with us. They are not going to offset a 20% SAAR drop in any one year and you know that. I think everybody does. But when it comes to making investments, as Dave said very well, you have got to be looking five and six years out. And we think automotive will continue to be a great average upper of our long term growth and outperformance.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Harlan. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
And up next is Toshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question. I just had one, probably for Rich. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape that you are seeing today, both in embedded processing as well as analog? You guys have been a pretty consistent share gainer over the past five, 10, 15 years. I wanted to get your thoughts on share growth potential going forward. Obviously, you guys are going through this recession which all else equal, I would think would be positive for industry leaders like yourself. You are also going through the go-to-market strategy change. You have also got the trade tensions between the U.S. and China. So we think about those three items, if you can talk to your confidence level around share growth over the next, call it, three to five years, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Rich Templeton
Yes. Toshi, I think you have almost answered the question. I think you described a couple of secular tailwinds if we do our job well where the secular headwind depending on trade tensions, but even there, if we do our job well, I think we can mitigate some of that. I think you also and I am sure Dave is smiling, you got to the right context, which is you have got to look at this over two, three and four years. I think we remind everybody all the time. And so you look at the share we gained going into and then the position we were coming out of 2009 downturn and we gained momentum in that and that certainly what our plans are right now. And that is about both analog and embedded. And it's about the markets that we focus on. It's the customers, the products, the technology, the capability like ti.com that we put in place. And it's where all our energy is going on a weekly and daily basis to get better at that.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Toshiya. We will go to next caller please.
Operator
Next up is Timothy Arcuri, UBS.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. I have two. I guess the first one, Rich, is another sort of another how to think about how those things evolve, I guess, move around. And I [indiscernible] --
Dave Pahl
Hello? Hi Tim?
Timothy Arcuri
Yes.
Dave Pahl
Yes. we are having trouble hearing you. Could you start over please?
Timothy Arcuri
Sure. Okay. So the first question really is around how the cycle evolves and how to think about it? And I guess I understand that the magnitude, the peak to trough magnitude is hard to look back at 2008 and to sort of look at that. But it seems like the near term supply chain boost that or the concerns that customers have about that, that's boosting near term demand, it seems like for you that effect is sort of beginning to wane maybe a little earlier than others because of your consignment model. So frankly, you are seeing it first and I wonder if you agree with that that it relates to the consignment model? And I guess the question is, does that agree that or does that argue that you would maybe see it out the other side first as well?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Tim, so I don't know, so first of all, we haven't seen what others have reported yet or what they have seen some. So it's probably too early to do that. And we have had theories of us seeing it early and seeing it late, just rather not weigh in on that debate and just report the facts that we have and let others debate it, right.
We do believe that by pulling and controlling that inventory, we will get much cleaner signals. But as we talked about before, our customers right now, they are not sure what their demand is going to look like. And so what they are telling us hasn't been updated yet. So even what they are telling us isn't completely clear. So it's going to take a little bit of time before all that stuff is updated.
So you have a follow-on?
Timothy Arcuri
I do, yes. For Rafael. So I guess on inventory. So if I assume that it's sort of flat to up in dollar terms, obviously your days are going to go way up in June, maybe they are 170 or 180 days like that and possibly they are up again in September. I guess I was just wondering like, can you give us some sense of what the pain point is where you might cut utilization? Is it an inventory dollar thing? Is it days thing? Or is it sort of just duration of recovery thing? Thanks.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Good question. First, let me step back and remind you that for us, the objective of inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence while we improve manufacturing asset utilization. The target of 115 to 145, frankly is kind of incidental, right. It's just a calculation. At the end of the day, this is a capital allocation decision. We are going to -- we have $2.0 billion-some of inventory. That's real money that's on the balance sheet that if wasn't there, it would be back in the owners bucket.
So we are very thoughtful in how we are going to, how we make those decisions to put potentially more inventory on that balance sheet, right. That's less cash that we have. But we just think it is going to give us great optionality throughout this thing, right. And you know, like any decision when it comes to capital management, it's going to depend, right. So that's the decision we are making now. We have to see how thing develop in the coming months and based on that, we will adjust.
The important thing, the inventory lasts a long time. This is inventory that is scrap level. This inventory is very, very low. So the others, well, there's a working capital and an opportunity cost to it, but it is very low given that is highly unlikely that it is going to be scrap. And it gives us just tremendous optionality on the other side.
Rich Templeton
Okay. Just to follow-up Rafael and Tim, Rafael said this before, so it's just me repeating his comments. The other thing to keep in mind and you spelled this out is, well, our inventory would be growing in second quarter. We will drain yet again distribution inventory. So we have just got to keep these multiple variables in mind and it just keeps putting us in a better and better position when we are doing that. So our balance sheet may show higher inventory but we love the fact that that channel inventory will be getting leaner and leaner and the inventory will be in one place where we can get the most effective use out of it.
Rafael Lizardi
I will go ahead and add, when you and all the investors listening on the call, when you compare us to most or maybe all of our competitors, our balance sheet is very different in that regard because we have many consignment arrangement. Well, 65%, two-thirds of our revenue goes through consignment whether it's through distribution or directly with the end customer. So that puts upwards pressure on that inventory level that we have. We also have our own manufacturing too, including assembly test operation, whereas to a very high degree, about 80% of our output goes through our fabs and maybe 60% or 70% through our assembly test operation. So that's also very different than our competitors. So that's why it's not apples-to-apples when you compare our inventory levels to those of our competitors. But let me make the point out though that we think owning and controlling that inventory is a strategic asset. So we are very pleased we are having those consignment arrangement. Clearly, very pleased with owning our own manufacturing and what that has enabled us to do any time, but particularly in times of disruption like what we just experienced and continue to experience where it just really puts us in a much better position to support our customers.
Dave Pahl
Right. Okay, I think we have time for one last caller.
Operator
And we will go to Mark Lipacis, Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I had one. Our own fieldwork in the supply chain downstream from you guys indicate that inventories are indeed like normal, if not lean levels and as the virus spreads around the world to places like Malaysia and Philippines, that the shortages of components, understanding that your inventories are at the high end of the range and not hearing anything about TI shortages. But basically supply is being disruptive and there is a reticence to give up any excess inventories downstream for you. I am wondering if you could describe what you are seeing on your own supplier base that you want to run your factory at consistent levels here. Are you seeing any of these supply chain disruptions that your customers are seeing at other components? Are you seeing that? And how are you managing that? And there is a risk that you are not going to be able to run your capacities consistently because of your own supply disruptions? That's all I had.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Not a problem. The short answer to that is, we are not seeing anything worth mentioning on this call. Little things here and there. But nothing that we can not manage. Remember, I referred to our business continuity program and we have been -- in this call, we have been mainly about inventory, finished goods inventory that we carry. But that also applies on multiple other angles. So for example, we also carry raw material inventory buffer. We have many dual and triple and quadruple sourcing of key raw materials. And we also have as I have talked about earlier geographically diverse manufacturing footprint in Malaysia, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, in Mexico, in China. So that just really puts us in a very good position. It also gives us leverage to work with the suppliers which by the way, we pay them in 30 days. We make that as part of our thinking to be fair to those suppliers and we don't play games on that. So that's also from a long term relationship standpoint, I think we are in very good shape with all of those suppliers.
Dave Pahl
Would you like to wrap this up?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So let me just wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. History has shown us that it is times like this when we can make the most strategic progress. We will continue to invest in and strengthen our four competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will also continue to pursue the three ambitions rich mentioned. We will act like owners who will on the company for decades. We will adapt in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would be proud to have as a neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities and owners will all benefit. It is these ambitions that will guide our decisions in the weeks and months ahead as we navigate these uncertain times. Our best to you and your family.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter 2019 and 2019 Year-End Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our capital management strategy on February 4 at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering the following topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter; second, I'll provide some comments about what we're seeing with added insight by segment and end market and explain why we would characterize the market as showing signs of stabilizing; and finally, since this is the end of the calendar year, I'll provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2019. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook, after which we'll open the call for Q&A.
Starting with a high-level summary of the fourth quarter financial results. Revenue was $3.35 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago, and EPS was $1.12 per share, including a $0.01 benefit not in our original guidance. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance with a relative strength across all markets.
At the company level, our year-on-year decline abated slightly from 11% in the third quarter to 10% in the fourth quarter. While this is only a marginal improvement, all end markets reduced the rate of decline substantially with the exception of communications equipment where the year-over-year decline increased about as expected given the strength in this end market in the year ago quarter.
In fourth quarter 2019, Analog revenue declined 5% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 20% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Analog's year-on-year rate of decline went from 8% in the third quarter to 5% in the fourth quarter, and Embedded's decline slightly increased from 19% to 20% over the same period.
When we look at the market, since 90 days ago, we moved from the third quarter where customers were increasingly cautious to the fourth quarter where results and behavior throughout the quarter reflected what we believe is best described as demand stabilizing. Based on history, this would imply that customer and channel inventory that built up during 2017 and '18 would now mostly be depleted. This suggests that demand this year will be more a function of our customers' end demand and, therefore, the macro economy, which may continue to be uncertain.
Moving on, I'll now provide some details on the fourth quarter by segment and end market. From the year ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 5% due to declines in Signal Chain, High Volume and Power. Embedded Processing revenue declined 20% from the year ago quarter primarily due to Processors, Connected Microcontrollers also declined. Our Other segment declined 24% from the year ago quarter. For the year in total, Analog declined 5% and Embedded declined 17%. Analog and Embedded combined were 92% of revenue.
From an end market perspective, in the fourth quarter, all markets declined year-on-year 3% to 4%, with the exception of communications equipment. Communications equipment declined about 50% from the year ago quarter, about as expected as all major customers, geographies and technologies declined.
Next, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2019. We break this into six categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 36%; automotive, 21%; personal electronics, 23%; communications equipment, 11%; enterprise systems 6%; and other was 3%.
Looking at the changes versus 2018, automotive increased by 1 percentage point, enterprise systems decreased by 1 percentage point and the remaining markets were unchanged.
In 2019, industrial and automotive combined made up 57% of TI's revenue, up 1 percentage point from last year and up from 42% in 2013. We've established momentum in these markets, and we see great opportunity ahead.[
Next, one of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity, which can be measured in multiple dimensions. From a diversity perspective, we have over 100,000 customers and tens of thousands of devices. In 2019, almost 2/3 of our revenue came from customers who bought $100 million or less of our products. In 2019, our top 10 devices represented about 5% of our revenue, and the top 100th device was less than 0.1% of our revenue. From a longevity perspective, over 40% of our revenue came from devices that we've been producing for at least 10 years. Our investments are directed to continue to diversify our growth across products, markets and customers, strengthening this competitive advantage.
Next, we are announcing today that we will be closing our last 2 6-inch or 150-millimeter wafer fabs, which are both more than 50 years old. This will be a multiyear plan and is expected to be completed no earlier than 2023 and no later than 2025. There are no charges in this quarter's results, and we'll keep you updated as needed in the future.
Separately, our plans to build our next 300-millimeter factory in Richardson, Texas, are underway with dirt moving and cranes on site. We expect the building shell to be complete by the end of 2021 and ready to install tools when needed to meet market demand, which will allow us to continue to support growth and strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage.
So to wrap up, we remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products. We remain focused on the industrial and automotive markets, the best markets and still be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $798 million, down 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue.
For the year, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We're pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term. Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $50 million. Acquisition charges will remain at about $50 million through the third quarter of 2021.
Operating profit was $1.2 billion or 37% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 42%, down from 47% a year ago; and for Embedded Processing was 25%, down from 30% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. Other income and - net income in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.12 per share, which included a $0.01 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $163 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.8 billion, down 4% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $841 million in dividends, an increase of 17% per share, marked our 16th year of dividend increases. We repurchased $489 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.3 billion. In total, we have returned $6 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the same period, our dividends represented 52% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.99%. Inventory days were 144, down eight days from a year ago and up five days sequentially. We are pleased with our inventory, and it is positioned to support growth.
Now let's look at some of these results for a year. In 2019, cash flow from operations was $6.6 billion. Capital expenditures were $847 million or 6% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2019 was $5.8 billion or 40% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to owners.
Over the last 12 months, we paid $3 billion in dividends and purchased $3 billion of our own shares, reducing outstanding share count by 1.4% in 2019 and by 46% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count.
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.14, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our 2020 annual operating tax rate to be above 15%. As usual, details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, as Dave mentioned, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages with our manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator?
"
2020-01-22,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Congratulations on the solid results. I guess, Dave and Rafael, just relative to the March quarter guidance, at the midpoint, you're guiding down about 3% sequentially, which is in line with kind of historic seasonality for the March quarter. But typically, off the bottom of the cycle, you can get some above seasonal. And at the midpoint, the year-over-year is just modestly getting better from December to March. So I'm just wondering what - if there's anything specific in the March quarter as to why it's not a little bit better than seasonal, and specifically, anything around distribution strategy that might be a headwind in Q1. And then I have a follow-up.
Dave Pahl
Yes, John, I'll take that, and Rafael can add if he'd like. I think - so to answer the last part of that question, there's nothing in the sequential guidance that would suggest there's any headwinds from distribution. We've talked about before that we would expect as we make the transition in distribution, it will look similar from a revenue headwind as we've seen with consignment. So there will be some there, but we've already got some of the headwinds from the transitions that we've made in consignment.
And I think the second part is as we're seeing those signs of stabilization, we talked about that history would suggest that the growth is going to reflect the end demand of the customers and, therefore, the macro economy. So as we go through the year, that's what will be the driving force overall.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. The only other thing I would add is, as Dave mentioned during the prepared remarks, our comms equipment was down year-on-year significantly as there was a tough compare a year ago. Well, 1Q '20 is going to have an even tougher compare on comms equipment. You may recall what was going on in 1Q '19 on that front.
Dave Pahl
Right. Was growing pretty significantly year-on-year. Okay, John, do you have a follow-on?
John Pitzer
Yes. And then my second question is just around the Embedded business. I know that the SIA MCU data is not necessarily the best proxy for that business. But when you kind of compare your results to that data, up until this most recent correction, you guys were sort of consistently outgrowing the SIA MCU data. Your Embedded business has now gone through 5 or 6 quarters of kind of undergrowing. And I'm just wondering if you could help us talk through maybe potential share loss. And I know you talked about CPU specifically being weak within Embedded, is that specific to an end market like comms? Or how do we think about that?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So first, John, I think you're putting in a good context. And as you've stated, we believe share changes just need to be judged over long periods of time. And so if you look at the revenue performance of Embedded over the last several years, we've had that significant outperformance, as you pointed out, in '17 and '18. Last year, we probably gave some of that back. So I just point out that in the most recent quarter, at the TI level, so Analog and Embedded, we saw that - those signs of stabilization but - in every market, so behaving similarly except communications equipment. So thank you, John.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
Trying to get to the trajectory and maybe the stabilization in turn. Dave, I know you said it was pretty broad-based on how you upsided the fourth quarter of last year. But can you give us what the sequential changes were by the end markets? I know you gave the year-over-year specifically, but if you could give that for the fourth quarter, that would be helpful.
Dave Pahl
Yes, certainly, Ross. So these are all sequential compares. Industrial declined mid-single digits. Automotive was about even. Personal electronics declined high single digits. Comms equipment declined about 20%. And enterprise systems grew in the low single digits. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore
Yes. I just wanted to think about the - you talked about shutting down the two 6-inch fabs. You told us about starting up the 300-millimeter. So maybe a two parter, if I may. Can you talk about the utilization plans in the first quarter? And how do we think about CapEx? I know you said you're moving dirt and you have cranes there, but out of that $600 million or $700 million cost that you said for the new 300-millimeter fab, how does that fold in, in 2020?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So Ross, you asked a bunch of questions there. Let me try. I'll answer the ones I remember. So first, let me emphasize, yes, we're closing two - our two fabs that still have some 150-millimeter equipment. And they're over 50 years old, and they'll be closed by as early as 2023 or as late as 2025, somewhere in that time frame. We have about $1.5 billion of revenue that run through those factories. And of course, we're moving most of that revenue, virtually all, to 300-millimeter, saw a significant cost advantage, as we have talked about over the years.
The new factory, so let me talk about the new factory. Yes, we've got dirt moving, cranes are there, plans are underway. We should have the building finished by the end of 2021. And at that point, we can put equipment as needed to support demand. From a CapEx standpoint, you want to model that at 6% of revenue. We just finished 2019 with CapEx at 6% of revenue, and you should model that going forward at about that same level.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Ross.
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Danley, Citigroup.
Christopher Danely
I'm going to put the hindsight as 2020 theory to the test here. So now that we've kind of gone through this dip and recovery, maybe just talk about why you think your sales and bookings fell off so sharply in late summer. And then what's - why are the customers a little more, I guess, a little more optimistic right now? And then do you feel better about your business now versus, let's call it, six months ago over the summer?
Dave Pahl
Okay. Well, I'll start off, and Rafael, if you want to add anything. I think as we go through any cycle, they're all similar in a lot of ways and different in others. And to put it in context, you'd have to go back to third quarter of '18. Running up to that, we had 10 quarters of year-on-year growth. So you never know as you're going through that you're going to have 10 or 12 or 14 quarters of year-on-year growth, but you expect at some point that the industry would run below. And so as we started that, we thought we were - what we were seeing was mostly an inventory - industry, rather, correction as we're working through that. Certainly, trade tensions, probably elongated that cycle and part of the reasons why we saw that other leg down later last year.
And so - and can you remind me the second part - or do we feel better about the business. I think that strategically, we felt that we continue to stay focused on improving our four competitive advantages. We haven't slowed down investments, and we talk about our fabs underway. If you look at the OpEx investments that we have made, those have stayed steady, focused on areas of diversifying our growth in industrial and automotive. So I think we feel just as good today as we did about the business. The cycles will come and go.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I would just add, as Dave mentioned, strategically, we are well positioned, have been, that hasn't changed. So we continue to feel as good as ever on that front. And then operationally, we just - we've got to be ready for whatever the market throws at us. So if this was - is going to last longer, we've got to be ready for that, if things are going to head south, but we also got to be ready if things turn around, and then we're going to start seeing year-on-year growth. So - and our business model allows us to do that, and we're well positioned for it.
Dave Pahl
Great. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Danely
Yes. Just a longer-term question on the Embedded Processing business. So if you look at the last couple of years, it has materially undergrown the overall business, and we're still running it, I think it's about 10% lower margins than the corporate average. So what are you guys thinking about? What should we be thinking about sort of the long-term goals or aspirations for the Embedded business just in terms of relative revenue growth or profits? Do we expect it to improve or not improve? And if it's not going to improve, is there anything you could do to change that?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I'll give you a few comments on that. As far as expectations, you mentioned margin. Frankly, that's not - Embedded is lower margin than Analog, but that is a nonissue. As long as their - Embedded contributes to free cash flow growth, that's the measure in stake. Obviously, the top line has gone through some challenges here that Dave talked about earlier. But longer term, with their focus on auto and industrial, in all of our businesses, but that includes Embedded, we feel confident that, that business will grow longer term.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thank you, Chris.

We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
I was hoping to better understand what you're seeing in the comms business. I appreciate the year ago quarter was a high compare, but the business was down 50%, as Dave you noted. Curious how big Huawei was as a percentage of that decline in Q4. And more importantly, how are you guys thinking about the trajectory for this business into 2020? And then I have a follow-up.
Dave Pahl
Sure. Yes. So Huawei last year was 3% to 4% of our revenue. That's really unchanged from what it was the prior year. And I think if you look at comms equipment overall, if you'll just look at the shape of the growth curve, you had the year kind of balanced with strong growth in the first part and followed by very weak growth in the second half. So the way that it's behaving, I don't think is - well, it isn't a surprise to us. As we were going through that very strong growth, we tried to remind everyone at the time that, that market is a market that's just choppy. And it's that way primarily in early phases of technology deployment. I think longer term, as we've talked about on our capital management presentation, we don't believe that, that will be a growth driver for us or for the industry, and that's just based on the number of subscribers that are out in the market and what the capital spending by operators will be longer term. So we really think that growth in our industry will be driven by industrial and automotive, and hence, why we've biased our investments into those areas. Do you have a follow-on?
Toshiya Hari
Yes, great. And sort of related to that, Dave, it was encouraging to see R&D intensity or R&D as a percentage of sales pick up in 2019 versus 2018. I mean it had felt like R&D was in decline for a number of years, so it was good to see that pick up. Can you remind us which product areas, technologies, end markets that you guys are focused on? I realize it's going to be industrial and automotive, but if you can give a little bit more color within those two end markets, that would be helpful.
Rafael Lizardi
So of course, from an end market standpoint, as you said, is industrial, automotive, that's where we're focusing. From a product standpoint is Embedded and Analog. But of course, inside of that, there's a bunch of pieces. So I'll mention a few. But I mean, at the highest level is - in the case of Analog is Signal Chain and Power. Those are by far the biggest areas. But - and underneath that, there's just a bunch of things. There's the - within Power, there's all kinds of power categories and then within Signal Chain. But Dave, do you want to add something?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I'll just say when we think of allocating capital to R&D, there's really three major buckets. And the largest bucket is - goes directly to product - creation of new products. We release 300 to 400 new products a year. The other two is kind of a shared, centralized R&D function that develops our process technologies, packaging tools that our engineers use like SPICE models and those types of things.
And then the third category is the Kilby Labs where longer term, higher risk investments are made, new materials, new markets and those types of things. So that's where the R&D has been directed.
I describe R&D last year as steady and stable. And I think that even in a down market, keeping those investments stable, keeping focused on investing in our four competitive advantages is really important overall. So thank you, Toshi.

We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Looks like the year-over-year declines have improved quite a bit in auto and industrial, moving from down high single digits year-over-year to down low single digits going from September to December. Of the 18 subsegments within these two end markets or by geography, where do you guys see signs of improvement? Or was it pretty broad-based?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So it is the latter. It was very broad-based, which I think continues to be encouraging on that front. And again, just given the diversity of our customers as well as the diversity - the intentional diversity of our investments to have that growth be broad-based, it's good to see that that's the way the business is performing. Do you have a follow-up?
Harlan Sur
Yes, absolutely. As you guys mentioned, looks like the team is now shipping to consumption. The guidance for this quarter is for a seasonal decline. But given that Q2 and Q3 are typically seasonally stronger quarters, do you guys anticipate increasing factory loadings here in the March quarter?
Rafael Lizardi
We only talk about utilization and factory loadings when there's significant inflection points. And in this particular comparison, fourth to first, we don't expect a significant inflection point. So we're not talking about it. Of course, wafer load utilization is always a function of what we expect for future growth.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And we'll vary those based on order patterns and as we see demand come in from customers. So thank you, Harlan.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava of Bank of Montreal.
Ambrish Srivastava
I just wanted to peel back the comments on stabilization. Both these businesses, industrials and autos and specifically, industrials, I forget, but I think there's 12, 13 subsegments. So when you talk about stabilization, I'm assuming - well, you never had any channel inventory buildup. Your channel inventory was pretty normal through the cycle and your lead times never extended out. So can you just help us understand a little bit what's the source of stabilization? Is it - it can't be the channel. So it's the end customer, but then you have thousands of end customers. So what's the right way to think to get comfort that you are seeing stabilization in that business specifically?
Dave Pahl
Well, Ambrish, yes, so it's reflected in the - stabilization is reflected in the order patterns, the demands that we see through consignment and actually the results themselves. So we went from third quarter where those markets were declining high single digits, 8%, 9%, some of them at 10%, to where all those markets were declining at 3%, 4%. So in those numbers, it suggests that there's a bottoming process.
And even though we're holding - in consignment programs, we're holding that inventory on our balance sheet, certainly, our customers have inventory of their products and then they have inventories that are down their channels. So just as the bullwhip effect would suggest that you have a small change in end demand as that moves its way back, that magnifies. So we can see the results of that beginning to abate. Do you have a follow-on?
Ambrish Srivastava
I did. Free cash flow margin. So you guys have powered through the 25%, 35% range you had given a couple of years ago. And you just had 40% in revenues down, not getting the math right, but somewhere in the high single digit, and free cash flow is down 4%. So would it be fair to assume that the targets should be moved up when we hear you talk about capital allocation in a couple of weeks from now?
Rafael Lizardi
So let me take that. So thanks for the cue on that. So we do have the capital management call coming on February 4. So I expect all of you to sign up for that and join us there. And we will talk about the various objectives there. But I'll give you a preview. We're not changing those objectives and specifically, that one that you talked about, we're not. And the reason for that, yes, we just finished a 40% free cash flow as a percent of revenue, but the focus is not that percent, right? The way we maximize value for the owners of the company is growing their free cash flow per share for a long time to come. So we focus on that, and that's how we drive value.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Ambrish.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Tore Svanberg of Stifel.
Tore Svanberg
First of all, coming back to the sort of recovery question, I mean, stabilization and eventual recovery. Are you starting to see backlog further out now? Or do you think it's kind of more just in time and kind of just waiting for how macro unfolds throughout the year?
Dave Pahl
Yes, Tore. Now just for those that aren't as familiar with us, I'll just remind everyone or just point out that 2/3 of our revenues are supported by consignment where we actually don't carry backlog but we do get demand forecast. And most of the time, that's at least six months of demand that we can see. So - and then there's no inventory. As Ambrish was pointing out in his earlier call, there's no inventory between us and those manufacturing lines for those customers.
So that's actually the strongest signal that we will get when we're looking at future demand. But certainly, the backlog pays - plays a part of that. So I'd just say that, in general, that it's consistent with the outlook that we have. And our lead times haven't changed - it hasn't really changed at all. So they have remained stable. So that allows customers to have confidence that they can get product when they need it. So do you have a follow-on?
Tore Svanberg
Yes. And I apologize for ending on this topic, but there's a lot of concerns about China in-sourcing, including Analog and Embedded Processing. I was just wondering what the company's strategy is on that topic. I mean is it - is sort of life is normal? Or do you actually have a long-term strategy as it relates to that particular topic?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I'll start and if Rafael wants to add anything. And certainly, as we worked through the year with the trade tensions and as that has unfolded, we've certainly heard discussions at Chinese customers, them wanting to ensure that they've got alternatives. But in the end, our customers are just very pragmatic, and they're looking for components with the highest performance, the lowest cost, the most dependable delivery. And those are all areas that we're very, very strong competitively in. With that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap things up.
Rafael Lizardi
All right. So let me finish with a few comments on key items for you to remember. We will remain focused on Analog and Embedded, the best products, and industrial and automotive, the best markets. Next, we will be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. And lastly, we believe growing free cash flow per share over the long term is what will maximize value for the owners of the company.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you for joining us tonight. Good night.

2019-12-12,Q&A," Session
Q - Blayne Curtis
Well to start it off, I mean obviously, the entire industry has gone through the cycle here. You always have the best -- you’ve been doing it a long time. You have a very broad business. So I would ask you to kind of weigh in, and I'm sure, you will put the appropriate caveat. So you guys have talked about cyclical downturns and how long they last. If you can maybe just walk us through your current thoughts? And we are starting to see some companies say, hey, you know it is all just stable. I know it's overly enthusiastic, but I would say that people are getting a little bit more encouraged that we're closer to a bottom and coming out of it, those are my words. I'm curious to, what you guys have on it? 
Dave Pahl
Yes. We have worked really hard to stay out of the prediction game as you know, right? So, not going to change that now. But I think you can put into context what's going on, right? And so it's best to ground that in the facts. And I go back a year ago in third quarter, that quarter inclusively had 10 quarters of year-on-year growth. So it was just probably longer than most cycles. It was the first time in quite some time that we had all the major economies synchronously growing. So, that type growth with some. 
And when you're going through that, you never know if there’s going to be 10 quarters or 11 or 12, and how long that upcycle will last if you expect at some point it's going to roll over and you'll have a period where you will be under-shipping. And, so, as things began to weaken in third quarter, we thought really from that point, following quarters we’d have primarily working our way through industry correction. That doesn't mean the trade tensions and all others that had a role to -- macro certainly has a role in the semi-cycle. 
And if you remember in the fourth quarter a year ago, we saw some unusual activity in China caused we think by trade tensions with distributors stopping, taking product about halfway through the month of December. Of course, they hadn't seen that repeat. That was unusual as we saw this last quarter three of our markets, being industrial, automotive and personal electronics decelerate in the quarter. When you look underneath those three markets, you've got 28 sectors that make up those markets. Most of those were declining. I think it was around 24, the 28 were declining in the core. So very, very broad-based. You had enterprise which was down about the same amount, down about 10%. It was actually accelerating, went from down 20 to down 10, so not still very weak. And then of course comms equipment, it's not going to be unaffected by the macro and the overall semi-cycle. But there's other things like technology deployments and things like that, that really drive it from first storage standpoint.
So that's kind of where we are. I think when you look at our guidance in fourth quarter, it's down double-digits, GDP is not collapsing double-digits. So somewhere between in-demand and what we're shipping inventory has to be being taken out, we have a system that tells us that, but I think it's reasonable to conclude. And so, when growth resumes that really will be what does the macro look like in 2020? Is it a world that has benign growth or is it growing, is it decelerating? And all those things will impact the shape of when things do return.
Blayne Curtis
Still leading to the exit board, I’ve probably been asking this question repeatedly about trying to put you versus others and treat out the gap. One other one I wanted to ask you, you had some distribution changes and did that contribute to any of the belts and when you’re talking about inventory levels -- and clearly you’re right, the market has gone down that much. Did that -- those transitions that you initiated caused any kind of temporary headwinds?
Dave Pahl
Yes, and I think as we came out with the guidance, it was as just described is really only for a couple of weeks until we had some of our other peers have a similar kind of guidance. And those questions of where are the changes that we made in the channel, was that impacting fourth quarter? And the simple answer is, no. Third quarter was in the books and we had the fourth quarter forecast set before we had the first discussion. 
So, just we’re in the numbers from that standpoint. In that transition, we had the first discussion in the beginning of October. Since then, we've been working on what that transition plan will look like. And our simple objective is to start as soon as possible and to finish it as soon as possible. So, we're talking about starting it in first quarter and ending in by the end of next year. We will work through those plans and communicate them when we've got more information on it.
But could we through that transition have bumps along the way next year? Certainly. We haven't done this before. But having a closer, more direct relationship with our customers we believe is the right place to go strategically. It is kind of just the next click along a number of things that we've been working on. And we've talked about before over the years in really strengthening one of our four competitive advantages and the things like deployment of our sales and apps teams in ti.com, the consignment programs and other things. So it's the right place to go. But could we have some bumps along the way? Certainly.
Blayne Curtis
So once you actually got just the entire vision of distribution channel and then you can pay several points for demand creation. And as that get bigger, you don't need that. You claw it back and you end up paying just very low-single-digit percentage just for some logistics, in a hope I may get. Is that the motivation here to kind of cut out some of those distributable or is it more consolidation to try to get more leverage, or what’s the reasoning behind those?
Dave Pahl
The reasoning -- and again they’re not of those four competitive advantages. And just for those who are not as familiar, technology and manufacturing, 300 millimeter is the best example of that with that kind of portfolio yield, the reach of our channels and then diverse and long live positions. So this one is about strengthening that one competitive advantage which is the reach of our channels and the objective -- objectives, right, again is to get more business but having a closer more direct relationship with customers we believe will allow us to do that. And we’ve put in place some structure over the last six, seven years. A lot of those steps along the way that we're really at a point now that we just think more revenue will come to us directly. And if you think of it more broadly, the Internet isn’t -- is disrupting a lot of industries, ours isn't untouched by it. I think because of the investments that we’ve made just allows us to push it much faster and much further to our advantage. 
Blayne Curtis
And one thing I want to ask you is that you guys had good growth and this is the kind of the first numbers but it would mean that you need a whole more inventory. I think you guys strategically decided to kind of weather the storm a little bit and raise your inventory ranges. So where are you at this point? Obviously this downturn has extended longer, so I think you did start to custom utilization and -- but then if you go more direct you are probably going to have more inventory requirements as well. So where are you in that in terms of what your internal inventory levels and do we see that changing and actually going lower or higher from here? 
Dave Pahl
Yes. We increased the top end of our range. So we think of inventory at 1.5, you’ve seen us operate above that. So there is nothing sacrosanct, about 145 days, or still something unusual. It’s really about trying to keep product available and lead times short, so customers don’t have to worry about getting that product. Things like the consignment programs where we have taken inventory out of the channel or out of customers and have it sit down in our books. We now have two-thirds of our revenue supported by that. So that has pushed pressure up on inventory days but we just think again having fewer buckets of inventory piles in the channel and at customers and controlling and managing that inventory is going to allow us to have more stable lead times and better product availability. So that’s why we're doing it. And again I think we’re unique that we can be in a position to do that, where some of our smaller peers probably just can't. 
Blayne Curtis
Dave as you said one of your differentiators is the 300 millimeter strategy and give you hard time for adding capacity and being way ahead of the curve and to value what you need. You did though for the kind of fab -- a new fab, Richardson, you pushed out two year. So maybe just talk about what is the 300 millimeter capacity, what’s utilization today with the downturn. And if you can just talk about that capacity add plans that you pushed out, what would that have provided on top for you? 
Dave Pahl
So we -- if you remember we announced in February of this year that we had selected Richardson for the site of new fab. We said at that time that we expected to start construction in the next couple of years. Nothing has changed on that. We're actually in the last 90 days, began construction of the employee parking garage. So there is a couple of cranes, if you’d drag down the freeway, you’d see construction moving on the site. And that's the first step of construction. The fab is actually going to go over the top of the current employee parking lot. So we will get that finished up sometime around the middle of next year and we will start construction on the fab itself. So no changes on those plans. We will probably have that done probably sometime at the end of 2021 and then we will equip it just based on market needs. And Rich has said many times and he has been quoting on, that would be two or three years early and have capacity in place in two or three months late. And of you just look at the asymmetric returns that you get by having that capacity in place and just not having our customers enough spending a lot of time, working through delivery shortages and those types of things is really important, so we can work more on their next products and getting more of our products designed in. 
Blayne Curtis
Well actually if you look at your results for this year versus others, one area, that’s kind of embedded business has been extremely weak. The analog business kind of puts foot with a lot of others. And maybe you can talk about why has that business been down so much this year? 
Dave Pahl
Yes. So I think when you look at and if you look at 30 years of history, it's not unusual that analog and embedded would perform differently over shorter period of time. And certainly the magnitude of this difference in the length of time is unusual. And I think it has a little bit to do with end market exposure. We've got more personal electronics inside of analog than embedded. So we're headed up in automotive, we are headed up in industrial. That's part of it, that’s not all of it. And so we're working through that today. So, I think when you look at the performance near term, you really need to look at it over time. If you go back a couple years, we were growing significantly faster than analog. We were growing faster than the market. So there is some normalization that we know that's probably going on to a longer term trend line as well. But that's kind of where we are today. 
Blayne Curtis
I’d ask you -- we were sitting here last year -- for you kind of typically 5G is a little bit of a wash because radio you’ve grown, but you typically want to have some on the digital side. Even have seen that segment I think last quarter was only 30%. Is there any more headwinds left or how much headwind do you have left on the digital side. And as 5G has been now deployed, now that you’ve taken some of the headwind away, is that now a tailwind to you guys? 
Dave Pahl
Yes. I wouldn't -- the -- what we’re seeing in the numbers today and even saw it a year ago, we were growing 30% year-on-year, right? And so when we were growing like that, we said, hey, just be careful, this market is notoriously choppy and we're just seeing the other side of that, right? And what's driving it at the top-line is kind of the servicing stops of 5G deployments, it’s trials in certain metro areas and certain operators will allow to get the equipment, they get it installed, get it debugged and then they’re ready for the next city. So those are the things that we're seeing driving the numbers primarily today. To your point earlier, if we have an incremental dollar of capital deployed, we're going to push it towards industrial and automotive. And we've talked about it before of, when you allocate capital you want to just direct more dollars to where you believe the growth is going to structurally be and that's where we believe the growth will be. Will 5G help in the short-term for comms equipment, and especially in analog? Absolutely. Those are decisions that we made seven, eight years ago to position us today. And do we think comms is going to double in size, like auto, like industrial in the next few years? We just don't. So our investments there reflect that. 
Blayne Curtis
Could I ask, I mean you made -- in '18 you and actually Maxim at that stage, they kind of did the same thing, where doubled down industrial and auto, and mainly talking about those two end markets that saw the weakest, right? And people went to more -- mobile and electronics did a little bit better. So really you of course went -- you went from 30s to low 20% of total revenue, right? If you look I mean that's effectively been a little bit of a headwind, so obviously, industrial and auto did come back, and I think the reason was higher margin of... 
Dave Pahl
Well, I think that the real reason is there’s a secular content growth in there, either own cars are being driven around. So, it's very obvious that there's more content going in cars. That same dynamic is taking place in industrial. It's just harder to see because there's 13 sectors and hundreds if not thousands of end equipments where more content is going. So, to beat those markets isn't going to double, it's really how it's quickly will it double. 
When you look at a market like personal electronics, if you take handsets and PCs and tablets and throw in the home assistance and portable speakers and things like that, our industry produces around 2.5 billion of those a year. There's a little bit longer than a three year replacement cycle that's drifting to five years. 7.5 billion people on the planet, that number just can't structurally double or triple in the next five or 10 years. 
So, now we're going to have those things in our lives for decades to come. So our investment there's not zero, but it's different than when you allocate capital to growing markets. So, that's how we think of it. The near-term numbers are the near-term dollars. 
Blayne Curtis
If you want to go back to the 5G storyline in terms of, I think you're going to see China tenders maybe in Q1 and that is going to be the biggest driver. Obviously, the Huawei drama has caused some disruption for people trying to sell into China. In terms of -- it sounds like Huawei has almost got like two platforms, some with U.S. content and some without. Do you have any opportunities, when you look at the China market, Huawei won't be all of that allocations and can you just frame the 5G storyline next year? And particularly within China what are your opportunities?
Dave Pahl
Well, I think, you can broaden beyond just 5G in communications and I think that's probably a good example of Huawei can grow the system that’s dependent on U.S. content. But there is a trade off that, that they need to make, when you're not using the best products that are available that can make the system and the trade-offs are going to be in size and power, cost, capability, whatever it is. So, if any customer in China, it’s really any customer around the world, they're always going through a making those trade-offs to use something that’s got more multi-source, or that is the best product that I can use that solves the problems the best way. 
And that will align or where that trade-off is made, maybe vent more in China as they deal with the realities of the world today. So, that's not a world that depending on where that line sits, doesn’t matter for us. We'll do well in either case.
Blayne Curtis
Maybe I just want to ask you, if you look at -- and you have a very broad portfolio. Some other companies have elaborated more trends. I know you just can’t have it all. So you obviously are battling lower SAR and we'll see if that equates to next year. But can you just like framing the opportunities you see an auto next year. And in terms of like what time you are seeing that growth opportunities?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So we've got five sectors that we're investing in and in auto things that you are very familiar with ADAS, infotainment, body and lightning, power train, and then passive safety. So the first four are other ones that have been drivers of most significant growth for us. We're investing in all five of those areas and very intentionally trying to make those investments as broad as we can. So, when you look at kind of multiple dimensions of diversity inside of auto for us, one is customer base. We serve almost 1,000 automotive OEMs. And when I pulled the list, I was a little surprised that it was that long. Of course the 80/20 rule is just that you got the big players like Bosch, trying to have Denso, Delphi are going to make up 80% percent of the revenue. But any one of those players will have a couple of thousand different SKUs that will sell to them. When you look at it from a product standpoint inside, we talked about this before, we got 65 product lines at the company, and about 45 of them ship products into automotive. So that diversity I think will serve us well, it has served us well in the past. I think it will continue to serve us well in the future.
Blayne Curtis
So that kind of things remind me when we're talking about those, and I wanted to ask you about China, who knows where the trade war goes. But I do feel personally that they're going to be permanent changes. Even if there's a deal the China is going to want to do more domestically. Just kind of curious, your view of the world, have you seen any areas where they've stepped up their investment? When you look at your sales to China, and you look out five years, do you think that's a different profile?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think it's a great point. I think you're right on is the world different today than it was two or three years ago for us? It absolutely is. In fact, Rich, our CEO, goes to China four or five times a year, and those dates are set well in advance. And he actually went to the Monday following when the Huawei ban came up. So really good timing, he was going to meet with our teams and our customers over there. And obviously pretty tense time. And if you remember back then that was mid-May we have the G20 coming up and the great hopes that we had, we signed agreement, completed. And of course that date has come and gone. 
But Rich’s point back then, it’s still true today is, if you've studied world history and you've got a rising economic power, challenging and existing power, that's not something that a trade agreement is going to solve. And we'll have that -- you got tension for decades to come. So get over emotionally, get back to work and figure out how you're going to succeed in that kind of world. So really just kind of setting that tone and it's not a prediction that that's going to happen but it's really just a mindset of quick wringing their hands and waiting for some magical event that all the stuff is going to go right. So that's what our team has been after and I think that’s just the mindset that you're going to have to succeed there. 
Blayne Curtis
Is there -- just to refine that point, is there any areas when you look at connected MCU, I think people traditionally see the areas -- Huawei is going to want these parts and -- but then when you look it more broader in terms of your portfolio, are there any areas that you would expect more Chinese competition? 
Dave Pahl
Yes. So China's ambition to establish a domestic semiconductor industry is not new. It’s been around for decades. We compete with analog competitors. We track about 20 of them today. And I think that's our four competitive advantages will serve us well, one is diversity and longevity. And if you can just look at from a product standpoint, our number one product last year was about 0.8% of revenue and it bounces around 1%. You get down to a product 100 and we’ve got tens of thousands of products, you get down the product 100 and you are at 0.1% revenue. We have hundreds of customers that buy those products, right? So trying to pick those off, they come in such small chunks that just it will never show up in one quarter and that doesn’t mean that they can't make progress, and they got good engineers and good quality people. But the huge investments -- you just can't invest and move into this market, concur in a memory market or other parts of semiconductor industry. Yes, so we are ready for that and we will compete with and we have competed with it. 
Blayne Curtis
Perfect. Always a pleasure. Thanks for your time. 
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you.

Tim Arcuri – UBS Securities
Tim Arcuri
Good morning. I’m Tim Arcuri, I am the semiconductor and semi-cap equipment analyst here at UBS, very happy to have Texas Instruments. With us we have Dave Pahl, who’s the VP of Investor Relations at TI, so thanks, Dave. Thanks for the time.
Dave Pahl
Thanks for having us.
Tim Arcuri
So I guess first I just wanted to talk about business a little bit, you’ve had about six weeks since you guided, some of your peers have sort of guided and maybe you’re citing a better October from kind of an order point of view, but the numbers themselves in terms of what your peers have guided are really not that different than what you guided versus normal seasonal and versus year-over-year. So can you talk about some of the puts and takes that are still impacting December and maybe what the key puts and takes are as we look out into the next year?
Dave Pahl
I think I’d put this quarter’s guidance in context by going back a year ago to third quarter and inclusive of that quarter, we had 10 quarters of year-on-year growth. Most of that was double digit, and one of the reasons why it was so strong was, so it was the first time and quite some time we had synchronous growth from all the major economies. And when you’re going through that, you never know, going to see nine quarters of growth or 10 or 12 or 14, but you expect that at some point revenues will roll over and you’ll have a period of declines just because our industry is cyclical in nature, right. So that’s basically when we began to see weakness a year ago in third quarter, that’s now continued for a number of quarters.
And I think third quarter of this year was interesting because we had, if you look at Automotive, Industrial and Personal electronics, all three of those actually decelerated in the quarter. If you go a layer underneath that, there’s 28 sectors that make up those three markets and I think it was 24 of the 28 were actually declining, so very broad-based weakness.
And Enterprise actually accelerating, but it was going from I think minus 19% to minus 10%, so kind of in the same zip code as those other three markets from a decline. And then comms equipment, there’s – it’s always choppy and has other first-order effects and it won’t be unimpacted by the macro, but there’s other things that are going on there.
So I think when you look out next year and our guidance in fourth quarter is down double-digits, GDP is not collapsing by double-digits, so somewhere in between end-demand and what we’re shipping just mathematically there has to be inventory coming out and we don’t have any system that tells us that, but I think it’s reasonable to conclude that.
So when you look out next year, it really will depend on what happens to the macro, as it an environment that’s running flat, as it one that’s expanding, as it’s one that’s declining and that will really make up the shape of that curve as we complete the cyclical correction.
Tim Arcuri
So as you kind of look into next year and you sort of handicapped, what would be required for you to have a sort of a significant up year, versus not a great year. And you look at inventory in the channel, given how much is actually coming out right now, how do you characterize channel inventory?
Dave Pahl
Yes, so our channel inventory, as you know, we’ve got more than two-thirds of it now on consignment and two-thirds of our total revenue is on consignment. And those that aren’t familiar with consignment program, some call it Vendor Managed Inventory that’s what our customers will call it. And so we don’t have an inventory of our product in the channel for that two-thirds of our revenue. What we do get is we get that revenue or that inventory sits on our balance sheet and we get feeds from their planning systems directly and we know usually it’s by day, what they’re planning to build and typically they give us a six month rolling forecast.
So, our visibility for that two-thirds of our revenue is very high, in fact, it’s as good as you can get. And I always remind everyone never confuse good visibility with stability, meaning those forecasts and that demand can still change very quickly. So in general, inventory that’s owned by our distributors as an example, that 4.5 weeks it’s been in that range for some time, so very well-controlled and mostly due to those consignment programs that we have.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Does the move to more consignment, it reduces channel inventory, but it also reduces your visibility because either it’s on or it’s off, either they pull it or they don’t, and to some degree for your part going through this, you at least have some advanced warning because there’s a component of bookings, right. So in some ways, is there a trade off? Yes, you get, you know, more stable business or rather more amplitude of the cycles with less, but you actually maybe have a little less visibility because either it’s on or it’s off?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So a couple of things and I’ve been in the industry a little more than 30 years. We’ve had – we’re working our way through the ninth cycle, right, and some of those cycles, when you look back over 30 years, like 2008, 2009, it’s like, man that was so bad, and let’s set that one aside because it’s unusual, 2000, 2001 was the end of the tech bubble, so you want to set that aside, so now you’re down to seven. And then there’s a couple that you barely began to grow or you’re barely began to decline and you might want to set aside one or two others, so you’re only – when we’re looking at what a normal or typical cycle is, you’re only looking at four or five data points.
Number one, so the impact that consignment will have. I don’t think we can say with certainty of what that is, but my instinct is that, you take inventory out of the channel, you get a cleaner, more direct demand signals from customers and again, they’re telling us on every day what they’re planning to build in their facilities. And our job in that consignment arrangement is to have material there for them to pull for that build. Now our visibility ends at that manufacturing line, meaning we can’t see how much inventory they’ve got on their balance sheet, how much inventory they’ve got down their channels and that’s why that demand can move very quickly.
But I think, getting fewer piles of inventory out increases your visibility rather than decreases, that’s my gut feeling. But we won’t, let’s get 30 more years and nine cycles later to compare and see how it changes.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Got it. Also, I’ve talked to many, many investors about trying to who were, I think previously tried to rationalize your guidance and there was a – I don’t want to call it like a conspiracy theory, but there was a lot of talk about, well it’s just because of – its just because of some of the distribution agreements and the roll-off of those, I think that Rich last week sort of talked about that and he said that, that’s not really the case. Can you just address sort of, is there any truth to that?
Dave Pahl
Yes, there’s, I think multiple conspiracy theories on looking at the fourth quarter guidance and that’s one of them. And that one we know for sure wasn’t an impact because third quarter was done. Fourth quarter guidance was set before we had any of the discussions. So we just know it wasn’t an impact, if it was were – it would be a convenient excuse, but it just isn’t so.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. So speaking of October and November are you seeing a similar recovery in orders on the stuff that does sell into distribution, certainly on the embedded side that, one of your peers talked about bookings in the month of October being very good. Are you seeing, do you kind of look at those comments and say, I don’t know what they’re seeing because like, we’re not seeing that, sort of what did you assume in your guidance, did you assume that, the month of October and November from a better perspective would be actually a bit better?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, the strongest signal we’ll get that informs our guidance are those demand forecasts that come through those consignment feeds and then on top of that, we can add-in our orders and what customers want us to ship. Now again, those things can change, but that visibility is pretty good.
Let me not make any comments about October, November, we’ll get those served up in January once we get the quarter done.
Tim Arcuri
Okay. Got it. Can we talk a little bit about U.S.-China trade, because what started out really is a run of the mill inventory correction has definitely brought in now with enterprise weakening in both China and in other regions like here, so can you just talk about maybe some of your key end-markets and kind of what you’re seeing from a macro demand perspective?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think in kind of the first question we saw demand in Auto, Industrial and Personal Electronics all decelerate in the quarter that was broad-based as I talked about across most of the sectors when we are looking at that. Enterprise is actually still very weak and all three of those had declined about 8%, 9% from the year ago quarter. Enterprise was about in that range, I think it declined about 10%, but that actually was accelerating up from minus 19% or so the quarter before. And then of course you got comms equipment that’s in the mix and that was down 35% from the year ago quarter, but the first-order effects there have more to do with 5G deployments and the staging of that equipment as it rolls-out than it does to have to do with the macro impacts.
Tim Arcuri
Let’s actually double click on that and just talk about 5G and Comms, I give a lot of investors asking exactly where you’re exposed for 5G, so A, can you talk about that? And B, can you talk about why things in comm equipment had been so lumpy, particularly people look at 5G and say, well 5G is ramping pretty significantly, why are things still so lumpy for you?
Dave Pahl
Yes, so I think to put our exposure and context, last year 11% of our revenues was comms equipment, two-thirds of that was wireless equipment, so you’re looking at 7%, 8% of our total revenues are our communications equipment. And that market, I think if we go back a year ago, in third quarter, we began to see the first initial 5G deployments in third and fourth quarter, I think we’re up something like 30% year-on-year.
And if you remember when that was all grown and everybody was getting really excited, we said, hey, it’s great revenue. We really – we’ve invested and we’re enjoying that – the returns on those investments now, but just remember this market is very choppy and of course it most recently hasn’t disappointed. And the reason why it’s choppy, there’s really two main things that drive the choppiness.
The first is as operators begin deployments, they’ll pick metro area or a region and they’ll say, hey, we’re going to build out 5G and our customers, the equipment OEMs will build for those deployments, they’ll take that equipment in, go-off and take three months or six months to get that metro area up and running, get the bugs worked out before the next phase of that deployment happens. So that creates, just starts and stops in that revenue stream as it looks for us.
Once you get into full deployment, you still have that effect. It’s just a little bit different. An operator will say, hey, back half of 2020, we’re going to build out and buy X dollars of equipment and they’ll ask all of the suppliers to submit bids. Well, if we just make the market very simple and say there’s three suppliers and each had one-third, they’ll all build 35%, 37% of demand in hopes that they’ll gain a little bit of share and of course, there’s not more than a 100% of the market, so that kind of creates an inventory cycle that’s pretty unique to comms equipment. So we’ve seen that market behave like that for decades in the past and really it’s not going to change, it doesn’t make it a bad market, it just makes it choppy.
Tim Arcuri
And can you talk – if you try to focus, where is your 5G exposure, particularly is it at the Radio Head, can you just talk about where your – where your exposure is, so that people can sort of better slot that?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, and to put into context, I’d put our investments in comms equipment and we cover this in February, when we go through capital management, we talk about by market what we’re thinking from an investment standpoint. And in comms equipment, our basic thesis is if you look at the number of subscribers on the worldwide network, I think we’re pushing, I don’t know if the number is 6 billion or 7 billion subscribers on the network. The revenue per user has kind of plateaued and has actually even been down a little when you look over the last five to six years.
And our belief is operators just don’t have additional CapEx to spend. They don’t have the economics when you look at five, 10 and 20 years to kind of double that CapEx over time. So our investments and if I contrast that to industrial and automotive, we’re not debating whether those markets will double. We’re just debating it, how quickly will they double in size.
So investments, when we think of allocating capital is very different in the comms equipment space. So going back seven, eight years ago, we took down our spend on the digital side, because we just as 5G deployed, we didn’t believe there was going to be much different there, nor an expanding market. Now because of the radio head units and the technology around 5G, there was actually going to be an increase in analog content. We took up the spend there. But we don’t see that as a long-term trend. We see it as – once we begin to make this transition to 5G. That growth from an industry standpoint just won’t be sustained over a longer period of time.
So we’ve made those investments. We’re in a good position. We’ve got a good footprint across to – across OEMs and again, it’s a good market. Now again, we’re only talking a few percentage of our revenue in total. But it’s a market that we’ve invested in, and we’ll enjoy the returns on that investment.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Can we talk about China? Clearly, there’s huge moats in analog. But I think at the same time, we’re hearing about maybe China being a little farther along in analog than I might have thought that they would be. We know that Huawei bought some assets out of RFMD many, many years ago. They have some partnerships with ADI, and there’s a ton of online job listings for analog engineers in China. And of course, there’s also Silergy and there’s SG Micro as well, albeit maybe a little bit more low end stuff?
Dave Pahl
Sure.
Tim Arcuri
So how realistic is the threat of replacement for you in China? And specifically at major comm equipment vendors there, is the issue less around replacement, i.e., yes, there are replacement parts, but really only low end?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think that as we talk to Chinese customers and really customers around the world, it’s no different that they want to have alternatives to supply. And the – having an alternative to supply may mean that you don’t take the best product that’s available in all cases. And you – whenever you’re designing a system, you’ll be making trade-offs on power and price and footprint and capability, precision and so we believe that we’re – it’s a trade-off that can be done that OEMs and especially those in China will make those choices. Now direct replacements, they’re just harder to do over time.
And that’s where – when you look at our four competitive advantages, diversity and longevity has served us well in the past, and will continue to so if you look at – just look at our product portfolio, our number product last year was 0.8% of our revenue. And that will kind of dance around the 1% or so range over time. And our number 100th product is less than 0.1% of our revenue. And we’ve got hundreds, if not thousands of customers that are buying those top 100 parts. So if you’re one of our competitors and you want to pick off our product line, not only do you have to – you’re going after a fraction of our revenue but then you also have to sell that across multiple customers. And it’s just – it’s not that it can’t happen. It just – it will take a very long time for that to evolve.
Tim Arcuri
Right. So diversity of product offerings is one thing, but the ability of China to actually displace you is another thing. And so I guess you’re saying can they displace us? Yes, but only in particular applications and not broadly.
Dave Pahl
And not broadly. And it won’t be something that happens quickly just because of that diversity. So again, if they could replicate those 100 products, which would be a challenge in and of itself than to find the 100 or a 1,000 customers to sell them to would be the next, the next challenge. So this isn’t something that is likely to happen quickly.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Can we pivot to autos? And I think you’re serving five sectors. You’re serving ADAS, infotainment, powertrain, body and lighting and passive and safety systems, which I think grows the slowest of those five.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Tim Arcuri
So can you sort of go through what your exposure is? And particularly, if you look at the end market, China got that first and U.S. and Europe has now become weaker. There’s some optimism about there being a recovery in China, but the visibility still seems to be a little bit lacking in that. So can you just go through what your exposure is? And particularly, what sort of signals that you’re actually getting out of the end market?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think, as you stated, we’re investing across those five sectors. The first four are taking the majority of it just because those are the areas where content is growing. And this year, there’s – I think we’re going to finish the year. Most industry analysts have about $400 of content in a car, plus or minus $50. And the debate isn’t – is that number going to double. The question is how quickly will it double. And if you look at 10 years, if it doubles, it’s a 7%, 8% growth rate. If it triples in 10 years, which some have forecast of that. And usually, the difference between those two forecasts is the rate of EV take-up. It would grow in the low-teens.
So our business, when you look over the last 5, 6 years, has grown mid-teens to low 20s. And certainly, that’s faster than what auto production is growing. The market probably has grown somewhere around that 10% or so over the last decade. So our investments because of the near term weakness, haven’t changed our belief of that market growing kind of than the three and a five-year horizon hasn’t changed and really have a steady hand.
Tim Arcuri
So do you have some views in terms of what the average content will be as you sort of project out your business five years from now in autos? Do you have some…
Dave Pahl
Nothing specific. I think that we just – when we look at the more – the broader trends, and we like the fact that the debate is how quickly will it double and contrast that to some of the other markets where just it’s just not going to happen, right? So we like that. We’re not really that concerned on, is it going to double or triple in the next 10 years. We just – we like that direction.
Tim Arcuri
And what kind of end market signals are you getting in terms of as you think about 2020? I’m not asking you for guidance. Just what kind of end market signals are you getting? Are you more optimistic? Or are you becoming more optimistic because there is some slight signs that maybe China could get a little better next year? How do you sort of think about autos as you head into that?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Again, I would – we remain excited just because of the longer-term opportunity. The near-term in 2020 of what the market will do is what the market will do. And again, most of the automotive OEMs that we’ve got are on consignment, the vast majority of that. So we’ve got very good visibility out six months of what they’re planning. Again, just to remind you, that can change very quickly. But we do have insight into what they’re telling us they want to build.
Tim Arcuri
And it feels to you like things on getting a bit better or…
Dave Pahl
We’ll provide guidance one quarter at a time. So yes, great.
Tim Arcuri
Maybe you could talk a little bit about strategy. So you put a lot of time and effort, as you said, into the website, and it’s definitely very, very unique. Can you talk about how the website fits into your go-to-market strategy, and how this might be a bit unique to the company?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So – it’s a great question, Tim. And I’ll put it in the context, we’ve talked about having four competitive advantages. One is the reach of our market channels, what this fits into. Just for completeness, the other three, really quickly are manufacturing and technology. 300-millimeter is the best example of that. Our broad product portfolio and then we’ve already mentioned our broad and diverse market positions that is a competitive advantage. But the reach of our channel, I’d really go back to probably seven, eight years ago, as we look forward and wanted to become a stronger company in analog and embedded markets and really focus on industrial and automotive.
We sat back and looked at the things that we thought we needed to do strategically. That’s where those four competitive advantages came from and things to strengthen it. So you saw us take actions like redeploying our sales force so that we were closer to customers in the automotive and industrial world.
The other thing is, if you’re servicing a large personal electronics manufacturer, and you walk in and say, hey, I’d like to meet with your RF team, you may sit down with 1,000 different engineers. You go meet with a small appliance manufacturer and ask about their RF team, they may not even know how to spell RF, right? So just a very different. So their need for technical support is much higher. Our mix of application engineers to sales has increased. We also knew that we had a lot of traffic across our website, but we really didn’t have any insight into that traffic.
So we began investing and really understanding how our customers select our products, and we began investing in tools to make that selection much easier. So if you’re a customer that comes in today, very quickly, we can – the algorithms are smart enough to figure out what type of equipment that customer is designing and that very broad product portfolio then gets shrunken down to the products that, that customer needs, the type of support, technical help that they get changes, the reference designs and those types of things. And it’s really all geared towards making that engineer’s time as productive as possible, with the end goal of getting as many of our products designed into their systems as possible. So…
Tim Arcuri
Got it. And is it more of the product portfolio that makes the website unique? Or is it more something about the website?
Dave Pahl
I think the enduring – and these are things, competitive advantages that work together. We get more web traffic across our website, not because people like the shape of the Texas state. It’s because we just have more products. And so that just drives more traffic across the website. And it’s two, four times as much as our nearest competitor, but some of our smaller competitors, it’s five, 10, 20 times the amount of traffic. So it really is a growing competitive advantage. And so we could actually give our website to one of our competitors, and they just won’t have the traffic to have it get as smart as what ours gets.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Let’s talk about 300-millimeter for a second. So you’re building the parking structure in Richardson. I think that you’re going to start to build the fab itself next year. It sounds like it’s going to be ready by the end of 2021. When do you think you’ll need it? And are you sort of happy that it might be a year or two early or it might be two years too early, but I think the mantra probably is that you want to have it earlier versus too late. So can you just sort of talk about the – update us on the status there?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So Rich is famous for saying, I’d rather be two to three years early than two to three months late when you’re planning capacity. And it’s just the asymmetric returns that you get by having those assets in place to meet demand. So having it completed by the end of 2021 we believe will ensure that we’ll be early and not late, right?
So we currently have – last year we had little over $3 billion of available 300-millimeter capacity to grow into. This year isn’t stressing that at all and be a little bit lower. So we’ve got plenty of capacity for the next few years in place. So really the timing of the equipment once the building is done, we can time that equipment closer to what demand will actually be. And so we’ll have that option starting in 2022 to do that.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. So this year, even though all the new designs are going on 300, that that 4.7 billion number from last year, that will actually go down this year?
Dave Pahl
Well Matt – well, I shouldn’t say that. Yes, I shouldn’t say that because of the mix between the two. I mean, our Analog revenues are declining this year.
Tim Arcuri
Yes, right. So, but the…
Dave Pahl
The mix of 300…
Tim Arcuri
New stuffs going on that too…
Dave Pahl
Yes.
Tim Arcuri
So there’s sort of a...
Dave Pahl
Yes, I haven’t gotten a recent update on that, so let me not make that as a declarative statement.
Tim Arcuri
Okay. Got it. Thanks. And maybe let’s talk about the P&L, if I look at OpEx and I look at your guidance for December, you guided OpEx about flat, normal seasonal is down kind of low-to-mid singles, I think. This was despite revenue being guided well below seasonal. Can you talk about what’s happening at OpEx? Is it that R&D is now maybe a little bit more of a fixed cost particularly on the Analog side or can you sort of bridge that for us?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So just a couple of things. We only guided in revenue and EPS and the conclusions in between the lines are pretty straight forward, but we just don’t provide guidance on it, just a point of clarification. And I think let me walk through and we allocate capital to R&D, how we do that and there’s three main buckets when we think about allocation. We’ve talked about before, Tim, that we’ve got 65 product lines at the company and you can think of those product lines as many semiconductor companies and that’s the first place our P&L comes together inside of the company.
And if you’re a product line manager you have your own design engineering team, apps team, marketing team, operations team, everything you need to be a semiconductor company. And they’re the ones that make the decision on which new products we should do. So the biggest bucket of our R&D allocation goes to – directly to new product creation. We create 300 to 400 new products a year. So that mean every product line gets anywhere from four to six new products that they produce, and they’re all looking for obviously products where we’ve got something that’s differentiated or have that differentiation for some time.
And then ideally a product that we sell to multiple customers in the same-end equipment better yet across multiple end equipments, even better across multiple sectors that we talk about. And then the perfect investment is one that you can even sell across multiple markets. So – and when you have that kind of diversity of customers, the longevity just gets pulled along with it on that investment. So that’s the ideal investment that we’d like to make.
What we’d like to stay away from is the other end of that is a custom product where the customer defines the spec, they hand it to three or four semiconductor manufacturers and ask for bids on it, and your investment in that is tied to the success of that particular product at a customer. So that’s kind of the spread of investment opportunities that we have and obviously there’s shades of gray between those two extremes and we’d like to just buy us more dollars up to that that ideal investment.
There’s two other buckets of investment. The second one is a centralized R&D function that’s where we do our process technologies, packaging, design flows, the tools that the engineers use, spice models and things like that. And we get some leverage off of that because if we had five business lines or 65, that investment would be about the same. And then lastly, the third bucket is what we call Kilby Labs and these are longer term, higher risk investments, new materials, new design techniques, kind of breakthrough type investments certainly are higher risk and sometimes they’re longer in duration. So we may have investments there that take a decade before they come to fruition.
So that’s really when we look at allocating capital, that’s how we look at it. We don’t look at it as a percent of revenue nor a budget. And so if we had more – better ideas and like, let’s say just double the number of products that we did, if we felt that that would change the trajectory of the top line because of the returns we make, we would – we certainly would do that. We just – it’s more about picking the right 300, 400 products than it is just making it bigger.
Tim Arcuri
Yes. I guess the – I asked the question because you’ve grown revenue by 30% in the past three years with virtually zero incremental OpEx, right? So it’s been great. But I guess I ask the question because like, have you pushed the envelope too far now maybe OpEx is kind of a bit more fixed and it really scales more with revenue rate for it?
Dave Pahl
Right. And you don’t hear us talk about, like, a goal of growing revenue faster than OpEx or setting a budget for OpEx and things like that. Because if we see the opportunity we would increase the spent and I think all of our owners would like that and have it, but there is an efficiency of that spend and making sure it’s going to the right places. So again picking the right 300, 400 products is and being doing that efficiently is more important than doing a lot more.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Can we talk about the balance sheet quickly as well. You were very, very early on the capital return trend that’s now a common mantra across all semis; everyone wants to return 100% of their free cash flow. You guys were very, very early on that and you’ve done actually more than 100 until this past quarter. But your balance sheet can still accommodate a lot more debt it would seem...
Dave Pahl
Sure.
Tim Arcuri
By my estimation maybe $10 billion to $15 billion more debt and you could still sort of maintain AA. So how do you think about the use of debt in this sort of a rate environment and how to optimize the cap structure?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think first of all I think debt is a tool. It’s a tool that we’ve used in the past. When we acquired national, now going back 2011 we financed that all through debt. And that debt has been on our balance sheet and has been there because primarily interest rates have remained so low. If you look over the last few years, you’ve seen that we’ve taken that debt up a little bit over time and – but you just don’t see any lurching moves by us overall.
So I think that there is a strategic value of having some debt capacity available because you never know when an opportunity may come. And so we just kind of have a balanced approach to it. And we’re not trying to chase the last nickel out of the balance sheet by leveraging it up just for the sake of leveraging it up.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Can we talk maybe a little bit, just to follow-up on the capital return question? So you did actually return a little bit less than – well quite a bit less than the 100% target in CQ3? And the repo was quite a bit lower, I know you tend to be a little – you tend to try to time the stock a little bit if it’s below the intrinsic value, you buy more, which is not timing. It just is more of being smart about what you consider to be the value of the stock. So can you kind of talk about that? Was it in fact the decision in September that – well the stock was above the – what you would consider to be the intrinsic value? So you just bought that glass?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I’d encourage you to look at cash flow generation and share buybacks on a trailing 12 month basis. What you’ll see is there is a lot of seasonality and cash flow. First and second quarter just have more consumption that’s usually an environment that we’re preparing for a stronger second and third quarter to seasonally. So there’s more cash going into our working capital. Why that – so you have that going on. You have bonuses and things like that, taxes in the first half that don’t repeat.
So there’s a lot more cash generated as a percentage of revenue in the second half. So really there weren’t any changes – dramatic changes to what we’re doing. But to your point, if you go back a year ago in fourth quarter, a year ago from now, I think on December 24th this always sticks in my memory, stock was at 88 bucks. We ended up buying over the quarter – we ended up buying $2 billion worth of the stock back. So the market gives us opportunities like that, we’ll take advantage of it. But the overarching goal is just to return 100% of free cash flow. It’s not to try to get queued on the timing or anything.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Got it. Can you talk about incremental gross margins? I know you sort of always talk about 70%. But is that still the right way to think about incremental gross margins even as you start to ramp the new 300-millimeter cap?
Dave Pahl
Yes, that is 70%, 75% is revenue increases kind of on a blended basis. As we build that factory, that factory will be depreciated over 30 years plus so it really won’t have any impact on the income statement.
Tim Arcuri
Got it. Can we just talk about trade for a second and talk about your infrastructure relative to that. I think you have two fabs in Japan; one in Germany; one in China; and I think you have an empty shell also in Japan. So the footprint is pretty diversified. But do you think you have enough infrastructure outside the U.S. to hedge in a trade?
Dave Pahl
Yes. We’ve got a dozen fabs in our footprint, around half of them or so are outside of the U.S. we also have assembly test sites. We have a half a dozen of those, so we’ve got one in China, I think two in Malaysia, two in the Philippines, one in Mexico. I’m trying to think of if I’m missing any, but I think that that covers them all. So I think we’re better positioned if this world gets to a point that it becomes disentangled from a economic standpoint. We’re positioned geographically probably better than most of our industry.
Tim Arcuri
Yes, sure. And then I guess last question since we have about a minute left. Relative to trade, the commerce department is going to come out with a list of both emerging and really foundational technologies, which is where yours would probably be on that list if it is on anything. Can you talk about how close you are to trade and whether you think that it’s plausible that Analog could be on some sort of foundational technology list here in the U.S. by commerce that would face some sort of export control?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think in both of those cases are very, very broad brush, at least the early indications of emerging technologies and things like IoT and driverless cars and AI, I mean, those are very, very broad brushed areas. Our products go into all those things. Certainly you can’t build anything without an Analog product in it, so we’ll just have to wait to see where that that stuff comes out. But it doesn’t seem to me to be implementable with that broad of a brush kind of strokes at least they’ve initially come out with.
Tim Arcuri
Well, we’ve run out of time. But I always appreciate a company who comes to my conference even though I have a cell and I’m very, very classy. Thank you, Dave.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thanks you.
Tim Arcuri
Thank you.

Q - Unidentified Analyst
In the interest of time why don’t we go ahead and get started. It's my pleasure this morning to introduce Rich Templeton, who's the Chairman, President and CEO of Texas Instruments.
We've got a fireside chat conversation here for about the next 30 minutes. It's a very informal setting. There is a mic that's being passed around the room, so if you do have a question, don't be shy, raise your hand, and we will get you a mic.
And with that, Rich, first, thank you. I really appreciate you coming out of the conference this year and supporting our effort.
I always find it helpful in sort of a fireside chat setting. So let the first question be a little bit open-ended to have you talk a little bit about kind of the core IP, but more importantly, what your strategy is and kind of what's the investment thesis to the room?
Rich Templeton
Well, John, as you know quite well, and you've followed it, we tend to emphasize the boring part but not changing too much, but hopefully, it's because we're on the right path. I basically think we're in the best products and the best end markets in the semiconductor business. So best products for the Analog and Embedded Processing chips, and the best markets are industrial and automotive.
And it's a very simple thesis on the best markets and that the semiconductor content of both the industrial markets and the automotive markets. Semiconductor content will be growing faster than those markets as they make equipment smarter, better, lower energy use, safer, whatever factor. And that's going to be a pretty good place to be for the long term. So a combination of those things are where we've been aimed and we remain very focused on it today.
Unidentified Analyst
You and I have talked about in the past that one of your core competence has been recognizing when it's a good time to get out of markets, whether that be memory or wireless. And it's actually - as you think about shepherding your onerous capital, it's a really important muscle to flex at time.
What's interesting is this is sort of the first time period where you don't really have any of the headwinds that you've had through restructuring, i.e., if you look, you've had tremendous EPS growth over the last several years, call it, 6, 7, 8 years, but not much revenue growth as you were kind of divesting out of these businesses. And so I think a lot of us out here are trying to figure out how do we think about the long-term revenue growth potential of the business.
And I guess, I'll throw back on you, how do your markets grow? How fast do they grow? And are you a share gainer? And so how do we think about your growth relative to market growth?
Rich Templeton
Again, we've talked in the past on this. So I think you can pick your long-term semiconductor market number. And I don't know what you would pick or what you would advise, I’ll bet it's a mid single digit number depending on exposure to personal electronics or data center, industrial, automotive, where - you can comment where you are on that.
My general guess is that mid single digit growth number from a revenue and a market point of view is probably a pretty safe assumption with our industrial and with our automotive bias and that bias should be growing. And you could argue, maybe it's a little higher, but it's probably just a safe assumption to make over the long term.
If you look at share, yeah, I think you look over 10 years, we tend to be a 30 to 40 basis point share gainer, a little more some years, less other years, but we've been able to grind that out. And we would always like to do more, but it's - if we can keep doing that over a long period of time, I think our owners are going to be pleased with that.
Unidentified Analyst
Well, if I can push the point on market share because the 30 to 40 basis points has kind of been an historic sort of number in your core businesses. And you and I have talked about in the past, what's unique about the Analog business is that it's still a highly fragmented business in an overall semiconductor industry, which continues to consolidate. I've joked with you in the past that you're the second largest Analog guy because there's this other guy called other that actually has a bigger portion of the market.
Given all the trends around the data economy and the importance of scale, and you've leveraged that importance on the manufacturing side, why wouldn't share gains accelerate to a higher level going forward than they've historically been?
Rich Templeton
I will give you great credit for consistency of thesis and question. And I think you can certainly make that argument. But you just know my nature and the company's nature, we're not going to get out ahead on that. Are there things that you can get excited about when you think about our core competitive advantages? 300-millimeter manufacturing and more helps more.
When you think about breadth of product, that's a strength that gets better with time. Reach of channel and some of the things that we can do uniquely in our marketplace versus our middle-sized or smaller competitors.
And if we're using that data and that information and that scale smartly, then yes, you can make that thesis. But I'm just careful, there's a lot of focus on revenue growth in this world that I don't believe is always healthy.
And so internally, we do spend a lot of time making sure the emphasis is, get stronger, aim at the right opportunities and bigger as a result. Don't just chase bigger because sometimes, you can end up places that you don't want to necessarily get to, and I think we've done that pretty well in the past 7 or 8 years.
Unidentified Analyst
You mentioned in your opening comments that you love boring, which means that there's hardly any controversy around TI and the company. And controversy is probably too strong a word, it's probably a word that we on the sell side like to use so that you read our first call notes.
But if you look at the guidance that was given in the December quarter, you guys went a little bit early, and it was a little bit weaker than what investors thought, and quite frankly, a little bit weaker than a lot of your peers.
And I think one of the conspiracy theories out there that I'd like you to address is that you've been on sort of a 3 to 5 year journey around distribution and your philosophy around distribution of trying to deemphasize the distribution network relative to being just logistic fulfillers of demand and being more direct.
And specifically, the most recent was the dissolving your relationship with Avnet. And some of the investment community have thought that maybe that's adding to kind of the negative outlook or cautious outlook for December. Is there any truth to that?
Rich Templeton
Simple answer is no. There's no truth to that. The more important one is that Dave got to have a more exciting October earnings call cycle than he's typically had the past few years, which is good. We keep him busy on that front.
But - and I look at this thing, and again, I put it under the boring context and time usually - and I think we've even seen it in this earnings seasons, where we were it doesn't look quite as different as the microchips and other companies come out.
Unidentified Analyst
Very true.
Rich Templeton
So I just put that aside. Time is what really matters, results over time matters. And on the distribution change, we've really been working on this for 7, 8, 9 years. Changes in how we've done it. And it's not about deemphasizing distribution, it's about emphasizing us having direct relationships with our customers because we think it puts us into just a better position to help them. And if we do that better, we'll win more business long term.
And so you've watched us at a very steady fashion, changing programs, consignment inventory, some of the latest changes with the global footprint, and that is all about building this relationship efforts of what we do through ti.com online transactions with the TI store.
And I remain as excited as I've ever been of what that future looks like. And I've just -- with all the changes we've been through, be it the sales and transitions back in the '90s with memory or defense or changes with wireless back in the 2000 decade, every quarter is never smooth and linear.
And everybody draws more attention to, well, is there something happening specific, or like just - this is where we're going longer term, and we think we're going to build a stronger company and a more valuable company. And I believe if we just stay focused on that, good things will come too.
Unidentified Analyst
Well, relative to your philosophy around distribution, I'm kind of curious, is this unique to TI because of your scale? And I'll draw an analogy, back to when you first decided to do 300-millimeter manufacturing, a lot of your peers downplayed its importance. And then aggressively went out and tried to find foundry partners that they could do a manufacture with.
But just given the breadth of your customer base of 90,000 plus customers, why not depend more heavily on distribution? And to the extent that you think you can do better direct? Can you talk a little bit about why you feel that way and maybe bring up kind of your web strategy within that context? I think that's kind of unique given TI's scale.
Rich Templeton
Yes, John, I think, and again, you've followed the industry for a long time, and if you look at the major distributors, they've actually become such broad line suppliers. There's actually no preference when you get inside of that. So if you really want to make a difference, you've got to go build that relationship directly.
And as you noted with a great leading question, we are probably the one company that's got the scale to go do this across 100,000 customers across the world, from a sales force and applications force. We've made the investments in ti.com, we've made the investments in the technical collateral and the data and the analytics to do that well.
And I put this, again, back on that same list of competitive advantages like 300-millimeter, like breadth of the product line, like reach of the channel. And we just try every day we get up to either invest to make those advantages stronger or to make sure that we're leveraging them in everything we do.
And if we keep doing that, well, the net result - to me the ultimate test of those competitive advantages is, are we growing our free cash flow per share faster than our best competitors?
And you go look at the thing over the past 13, 14 years, we've been able to do that, and we continue to stay focused on that. I think we'll be able to go do that for another decade out ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Can you spend a little bit more time elaborating on the ti.com strategy? Because I do think it's pretty unique to your company. And specifically, how you're using that to help drive incremental sort of opportunity sets?
Rich Templeton
Simplest thing to start with is when you or anybody in this world are particularly if a design engineer that's graduating from college, they starts a design project, where does he or she go? They don't call a salesperson. Most engineers, we don't like talking to people, okay? We'd rather get online and solve it ourselves. So where are they going to go? They're going to go to the web.
And so we want to make that ti.com experience to where we are just literally the easiest and the most efficient way for our design engineering customers to search for parts, select them, design them in, get to production and then never have any issues. And as I tell people internally, if that's all we do and we do it well, we're going to be very successful.
And so if you just look at what we've been investing in, it's all consistent with that approach. And it's make sure the products are easy to - make sure you've got great parts, that's all helpful, make sure it's easy to find, make sure you've got the best technical collateral and information. And so the investments continue, we feel like we've moved early on that. And I think if we stay aggressive, we'll be able to make it a real advantage long term.
Unidentified Analyst
Given your breadth and your size, the fact that you operate so well, as much as you hate this, we in the investment community always lean upon you guys to tell us about your views on the cycle. And then whenever you talk about it, we dissect it like Fed speech to see what did they say this time versus 90 days ago? How has it changed?
But in that vein, can you talk a little bit about where you think we are in the cycle? Historically, you've talked about sort of the observation that it's usually 4 to 5 quarters of down year-over-year growth before things start to reaccelerate.
Just given how uncertain the environment is and the fact that year-over-year growth rates are actually accelerating to the downside with your December guide, where are we in the cycle, and how do you see 2020 playing out?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I don't change what Dave and Rafael have talked about what you just summarized. And we don't hate talking about it, we just don't find it very relevant, okay, for our world because we spend our time making sure we can handle any outcome of plans in 2020, but we're also busy making sure we can handle any outcome of plans in 2023.
And so we've got work under way down in north of Dallas today, getting ready on the next 300-millimeter fab. And we don't need it this quarter, and we don't need it in 2020, but I'd rather be a few years early than a few years late when it comes to being able to grow that out.
So this one is, I think, from a semiconductor cycle, meaning the inventory buildup and drain down, I think it's all happening pretty much according to the way it usually does. It's 4 or 5 quarters. You can look at history, sometimes it's 6. I don't try to be that precise.
The secondary question, I actually think is the broader one, and I’m sure it's for everybody as investors is, what's the broader global economy want to do in 2020, okay? Because you can get the inventories down, but then you're back to being dependent on what end consumption is going to look like. And we’re not going to try to make a great forecast, we're going to make sure we can handle a range of outcomes and do well with that.
Unidentified Analyst
Perhaps every cycle is the same, except it's different. And I think the biggest sort of known, unknown at this time around is U.S., China trade relations and what's going on there. I know you spend a lot of time in Washington, you spend a lot of time with the SIA Board. Kind of give us sort of your assessment of where things are in the near term, one.
But I guess, more importantly because I want to really make it a TI question. Independent of what happens at the end of this journey, it seems like China is resolved to decrease their dependence on U.S. suppliers is only going to go up over time.
And I think in your Analog business, there's enough moats that are deep enough and big enough that it's probably not something that we as investors have to worry about. But I do think in the Embedded business, perhaps there's opportunity for domestic substitution with either Chinese suppliers and/or non-U.S. suppliers of that business. Can you handicap kind of that risk going forward?
Rich Templeton
So you have quite a bit in there. Let me go with the simple thing. First is that somewhat even like the market environment, the biggest thing I've learned and we talk to people internally is we do not control the market. We control our performance relative to the market that lets us have full accountability. We don't control China, U.S. trade relations, it's going to be what it's going to be.
And I've told people internally, assume that it's permanently changed, now go win, okay? So we get past excuses, get past waiting for some deal to get struck. You've got to go make your products more appealing than anybody else in the world on that front. So I'm actually very pleased with that focus because it usually drives great results.
On the question of long-term China -- growth of the China industry, you and I've talked about this. I've always had that on the list of exogenous things that you've got to be prepared for. But China's ambition to build a domestic semiconductor industry is not new. Go back to the '80s and pull up one of the 5 year plans and look at the investments that have been made now for 3 or 4 decades trying to build that.
And so it isn't a new thing. They certainly are going to have yet another round of a fund trying to do things. If you're in the DRAM or flash business, it's probably a -- not probably, it's a different problem than we'll face, fortunately. So you'd better respect it, but it isn't going to change things overnight. And so there's going to be plenty of room to compete.
In our Embedded business, the beauty about it is it's not just the - put some memory on the side of a 32-bit processor because there is 12 people that can do that. And we have spent a lot of time and investment to make sure it really is made up of unique products with unique value.
And if you go do that, we can be as successful in China as we can be anywhere else in the world on that. So I don't think we're going to have more exposure on the Embedded side on the China front as discussed.
Unidentified Analyst
Part of the disadvantage of embracing boring, I don't think it's the wrong strategy, is that it leaves us, the investment community, kind of struggling with better understanding of the company.
Rich Templeton
I think your comment multiple years ago when we were beginning this transition is it makes us difficult to analyze.
Unidentified Analyst
What's - to me, it's actually better for your multiple, not worse for your multiple.
Rich Templeton
It’s a very wonderful problem.
Unidentified Analyst
But in the Embedded side of the business, if we look at the landscape, there's been a land grab for RF technologies on the M&A front. And I guess, can you help us position, if we got a spots and dots chart of all the IP that you have within your Embedded business and kind of look at the competitors across the board, where are you strongest? Where are you weakest? And if you think about kind of the buzzwords that Wall Street thinks about as the real drivers of that business, what would they be?
Rich Templeton
So I think you're going to be the IP dot chart, and we grew up knowing it because when you played in the wireless markets and these, you're very experienced though. And they're wonderful bragging contests at investor meetings, but they don't always correlate to long-term results, as you've probably witnessed by seeing more claims of success.
So I don't look at that as a great way to take inventory on the portfolio. What I care far more about is how good are the businesses inside of Embedded at solving customers' problems.
And so where you've got low-power microcontrollers, do you do it well? Where you've got a controller that does a great job with embedded control or motor control or support for electric vehicles, does it do it really well? Do you solve the problems really well?
I think our growing radar business is going to really stand out as I think we're ahead of a lot of people growing that. Our position in some of the ADAS and infotainment spaces with really smart, balanced, low-power processing is very unique.
And those are the ways that we tend to think about that portfolio, what we have to do and what we have to do well. It is rich. We could fill out the dot chart, okay? But then a lot of other people are busy trying to fill it out. It's how you use it together and how you use it together well that really makes the difference.
Unidentified Analyst
Talking of M&A. You're overdue on your 10 year.
Rich Templeton
We're 15 minutes in and we got to M&A.
Unidentified Analyst
I’m curious because you haven't been shy in the past. And you've made relatively large bets that have had relatively good returns. How do you kind of view M&A as a strategic - as sort of a device today? And is the M&A environment to you fruitful, not fruitful? Put it into context.
Rich Templeton
I think it remains an important aspect of capital management, capital allocation. But as with all things around capital allocation, it depends on what the returns look like. And as you remember quite well now, when we did National, it was no great roar of applause. In fact, it was probably the opposite that we received, but it was a no-brainer.
Unidentified Analyst
I’m pretty sure that's when you decided boring is better.
Rich Templeton
Well, it was - it was just a no-brainer and that -- the free cash flow on purchase price was 6 something percent. And I know how to turn a free cash flow yield of 6% purchase price into a great return on investment.
I don't know how to take one that returns 3% on purchase price, okay? I can turn it into 7%, but I can't turn it into 10% or 11% over time. So I thought 2009, '10 and '11 were just a perfect time to buy stuff. The world was petrified.
And we said, well, if everybody is petrified, let's go buy wafer fabs, let's go buy used equipment, let's go buy what we thought was one of the best analog assets, and it was a great time to do that.
And now with valuations where they are, it is a great time to be putting that money into organic growth, organic competencies, many of which we've talked about and grow that thing going forward.
Biggest thing I tell investors is that the day we start being interested in M&A., you guys are probably going to be in a lousy mood, okay, because it probably means things aren't that great. That's the perfect time to be trying to look for that. So I don't think anything's changed, just you've got to be patient.
Unidentified Analyst
Sticking on capital allocation. Your #1 priority, as it should be, is to invest in the business. The two biggest investment drivers are R&D and CapEx. We've talked about R&D in the past. I think the vast majority of investors look at your revenue to R&D ratio and say it's too low. I’m one of the few that actually argue it might go lower. You sit there and go, that's not how we think about the business.
So can you spend a few minutes just talking about how you go about defining the opportunity set for R&D? And I guess to my question or to my thesis, if more and more of the business over time migrates towards industrial and auto, which are longer duration sort of products, why isn't R&D going to be much more leverageable as a percent of revenue going forward?
Rich Templeton
So I’m just careful with the last part of that statement because it implies, okay, then by how much? And I just think it comes back to -- and you hit the nail on the head, people do not understand the power. You develop a successful part for industrial and automotive, and it lives for 15, 20 years, let me help you, you're not investing in that part, you're just running it for a long time, and those are tremendous returns. And there's not a static percent of revenue in the current year model that makes sense to look at.
So where our product people spend all their time is making sure we're getting investment to the best opportunities. And I believe that scarcity or that pressure of scarcity. Okay, business unit leader, you've got 10 projects, we're going to get you enough R&D to cover 5 of them. Because our people, all people are really good at getting the right fund at the top of the list.
And you go find a company that invests in every idea they have, I'll show you the one that's working on stuff they shouldn't be working on. And so that pressure of scarcity, I think, is one of the great things that our leaders are really getting better at. And that includes portfolio management.
If you’ve got a group where the list of opportunities is better than somebody else, then be getting resource move from one bucket to another. You guys will never sure about that because it's done at a lower level in the organization, but that’s a very powerful way to strengthen things. So we do not look at it as a what percent of revenue. But if we really think there's better and better opportunities, we'll take the R&D up.
Unidentified Analyst
The other side of that is CapEx. Before this most recent correction in the semiconductor industry, you guys were on path to start breaking ground for your next 300-millimeter facility. Can you talk a little bit about the status of that? And I guess, the concern in the investment community is, you had that once in a lifetime opportunity of building that first fab really, really cheaply, and that benefited the model over multiple years.
This fab, by definition, is probably going to be more expensive because you're not going to be able to buy equipment out of bankruptcy. So how do we think about the impact kind of on the operating model as this fab ramps?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I think it's two things. First, anybody that drives up or down central expressway through Richardson, there is two cranes up in the sky, okay? That's to get the parking garage built. And the reason you got to get the parking garage built is new fab is going to go where the parking lot is, okay? So you've got to get one done before you can start the other.
So we're moving on that, we'll get going on the building later in 2020, make sure we have that thing being available sometime late '21, I think that will be in plenty of time depending on what range of assumptions you make on the market.
If you watch our history, we built our first 300-millimeter fab, the shell got built in '96. We didn't tool it until '01. We built the Analog renter facility, and I think we got it stood up in '06. We didn't tool it until 2009 and '10. And does it sound like we tool these things at the bottom of markets? Yes, it does turn out by coincidence, we did that. But it's a perfect time that you're ready for growth that comes out of it. So I think we're going to be in great shape.
Unused versus not used equipment. 300 millimeter is the magic, okay? That's what gets you 40% die cost reduction, and that makes all the economics work. Now if you can get discounted equipment on top of that, that's even more fun, okay? So are we going to get that? We've made the assumption? No. Just because the amount of used equipment we're assuming will be lower.
But if we find it, we will certainly buy it. And there is a used equipment market. There's always equipment dominoing out of some of these leading-edge memory or logic facilities that no longer need it, and we can use it for 30 or 40 years when it's all said and done. So we guided - assumed it's a little more on CapEx, but still very reasonable numbers. But even with newer equipment, paybacks will be spectacular.
Unidentified Analyst
Any question in the audience? Richard, maybe I can continue then. If you look across the semiconductor landscape, and quite frankly, the tech landscape, a lot of ex TI-ers out there, so it's clear that they've been very successful in their career. So it's clear that there's a lot of great internal talent at TI.
The question does come up from time to time about succession. In large part, help us understand kind of how you're viewing succession? Is it an internal candidate? Do you have a strong bench. It's a bench that I think a lot in the investment community probably hasn't been introduced to. So if we can spend a few minutes talking about it?
Rich Templeton
Yes. I think there's a few very simple things, and that is, I think we've got a great team, and John you've followed us for a bunch of years. I think we've surprised people every 5 years that goes by, gosh, that bench looks stronger.
The people are like, well it can't be, well, and then it is, and I think it's because we -- one, we've got great people, and they continue to get better working that business model that we have on the inside.
So you get a chance to meet the people we've got run of the major businesses. It is it is a wonderful cross-section that we have so that the Board has -- if I do my job right, they've got great candidates internal that doesn't preclude external, but make sure you're giving them great alternatives.
And it's very simple, let's find somebody give us another 10, 15 year strong run to make this play stronger. So that's how we think of it. I think we'll be successful doing it.
Unidentified Analyst
My last question. It’s hard to fault you guys on what you've done on cash return. It's - you started the trend, everyone followed, you've done a fantastic job.
Rich Templeton
Usually questions that begin like that go some...
Unidentified Analyst
But there's a but.
Rich Templeton
There's always a but.
Unidentified Analyst
But you know I talked about this. If you look at your balance sheet, it looks like you're underlevered. It looks like you could borrow debt at a lower cost of capital than your dividend yield, and you could buy back stock all day long, why not do that?
Rich Templeton
So I think it's - to me, it's just a degree of how far or how much. And I think if you look back and you ask, where is our leverage today? Where was it even 3 years or 5 years ago? I think we've taken advantage of an incrementally very favorable environment, and you described it quite well.
I forget, if we've got an average interest on debt is sitting in the 2.2%, 2.3%, I forget the exact rate in terms of where that is. So I think Rafael and his team have really been very thoughtful and very disciplined in terms of how they've done that. But at the same time, I don't believe this is one of these contests of setting up the MBA finance class who can maximize the leverage for any one quarter to strengthening. Balance sheets are things that I'd like to make sure they work well not only in an upmarket, but who knows what the future is.
And let’s make sure that thing is very, very strong over the long term. And somebody once said that balance sheets don't matter until they're the only thing that matters. And why risk for a little bit of incremental leverage, something along those lines. I think it's a great strategic asset to keep us at strength.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. With that, we’ve ended our time in this session. I want to thank everyone for joining us, but especially, I want to thank Rich for spending time with me this morning.
Rich Templeton
Folks, thank you. John, thank you.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments' 3Q 2019 earnings release conference call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I will be covering the following topics: First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the third quarter. Second, given the additional weakness we have seen, I will provide some comments about what we are seeing with added insight by segment and end market. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and then the outlook, after which will open the call for Q&A
Starting with a high-level summary of our third quarter financial results. Revenue decreased 11% from a year ago and came in below the midpoint of our guidance as we saw most end markets continued to weaken further. In our core businesses, analog revenue declined 8% and embedded processing revenue declined 19% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both business' year-on-year year growth decelerated. Earnings per share were $1.49, including a $0.09 benefit for items not in our original guidance due to discrete tax benefits.
With that backdrop, I will now provide details on our performance. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-months period was $6 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 41% of revenue.
We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or if it's returned to owners. For the trailing 12-months period, we returned $7.4 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in the business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners.
Moving on, I will now provide some details on the third quarter by segment and end market. For the year ago quarter, analog revenue declined 8% due to declines in power, signal chain and high volume. Embedded processing revenue declined 19% from the year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers. All markets declined across embedded, but the declines were most pronounced in the automotive and communications equipment markets. Other declined by 19% from the year ago quarter due to DLP and custom ASICs.
Next, I will provide some comments on what we are seeing in the market and insight into this quarter's performance by end market versus a year ago. As we said, when you look at 30 years of history, semiconductor cycles can vary widely but typically experienced four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before returning to positive growth. We have also said that the current trade tensions could impact the depth and duration of the cycle. We have provided these comments as contexts not as a prediction about the current cycle.
With the end of this current quarter, we have now experienced our fourth consecutive quarter of negative year-on-year growth. There is an increasing number of reports of macroeconomic weakness with trade tensions as the primary contributor. Consistent with this, the weakness we have seen in the third quarter was broad-based across all markets and most sectors.
Industrial, automotive and personal electronics, all declined upper single digits from the year ago as almost all 28 sectors within these markets declined. In communications equipment, revenue declined about 35% from the year ago and 20% sequentially. We saw weakness across all major customers, regions and technologies. And lastly, enterprise systems declined from the year ago quarter.
We have learned over the years that staying focused on building the company stronger, especially in the face of a weak market provides great long term rewards. We continue to invest in and leverage our competitive advantages. The breadth of our product portfolio and channels to market including our direct sales and applications team as well as TI.com provides us the broadest reach to your customer base, a unique advantage.
We have been evolving our distribution network over the years and continue to do so today as we build stronger direct relationships with our customers. We remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products. We remain focused on industrial and automotive, the best market. They will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets as they have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and the outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.45 billion or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $778 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 22% of revenue.
Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long term.
Acquisition charges and non-cash expense were $79 million. Acquisition charges will decline to about $50 million in the fourth quarter and will remain at that level through the third quarter of 2021.
Operating profit was $1.59 billion or 42% of revenue. Operating profit was down 18% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 46%, down from 50% a year ago and for embedded processing was 32%, down from 35% a year ago. Despite current weakness, our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time.
Other income and expense was a $34 million benefit, up $11 million from a year ago. Net income in the third quarter was $1.43 billion or $1.49 per share, which included a $0.09 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $149 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-months basis was $6.03 billion.
In September, we announced we would increase our quarterly dividend by 17%, marking our 16th year of dividend increases. In the quarter, we paid $721 million in dividends and repurchased $456 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.18 billion. In total, we have returned $7.38 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 48% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.07 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $750 million of debt and issued $750 million of debt with a coupon of 2.25% due in 10 years. This results in total debt of $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.99%.
Inventory days were 139, up eight days from a year ago and down four days sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs. Work in both of these areas is mostly complete. Given the weaker environment, we have reduced wafer starts to align with demand.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 to $3.33 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $1.09, which includes an estimated $5 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% for 2019, As a reminder, acquisition charges will decline to about $50 million in the fourth quarter and remain at that level through the third quarter of 2021.
In closing, as Dave mentioned, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, analog and embedded processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which we believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
"
2019-10-22,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. The first one is on the Q4 outlook. How do we get confidence that this isn't company specific or share loss, because when we looked at some of the SIA data for July and August, it was more positive. So is it anything that is company specific in Q4, because the guidance is substantially below? We understand the macro environment is not that great. But is there anything one-off company specific that is impacting your guidance? Is there any share loss issue? Any other color that you could provide would be very helpful.
Dave Pahl
Yes. Vivek, I will take that. I would say, state the obvious, obviously the SIA numbers are more backward-looking versus the looking into fourth quarter. And I think when you judge share and we have talked about this in past, but you really need to judge it over multiple quarters. You look at the diversity of our revenue. We talk about one of our competitive advantages being diversity and longevity. Our biggest the product last year, as an example, was about 0.8% of our total revenue. So just that diversity, I think, has served us well and will continue to serve us well.
Do you have a follow-on?
Vivek Arya
Yes. Thanks Dave. Somewhat more longer term, there is a lot of discussion of parallel technology in semis ecosystem developing in China as it tries to get more self-sufficient. How well is TI placed from a competitive perspective? Do you think there are substitutes for your kind of analog and embedded products from Chinese vendors over some intermediate timeframe? And what would TI need to do different as a company to react to this new ecosystem?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I will start off. I think if you look at the analog and the embedded market, they have got many natural competitive moats that sit around the marketplace overall. I think that we have certainly heard discussions of Chinese customers wanting to ensure that they have alternatives. But it's very different than being designed out. So our customers overall are very pragmatic. They are looking for components with the highest performance, the lowest cost and the most dependable delivery. So I think we will continue to focus on those things. And they have served us well in the past and we believe it will continue to serve us well in the future.
Thank you Vivek. We will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow-up on a little bit around Q4. We have been in this environment for a while. I think you had your first guide for cut actually on this call a year ago. But even on that call, you had guided Q4 2018 down about 12% sequentially which was obviously below. We are a later. We have had a number of rounds of cuts. So the base is even lower and now you are guiding Q4 2019 down by 50% sequentially. So it's even worse on a sequential basis than we saw in the year ago quarter when we started. I guess it's and again it's not like things have been weak all along. I guess if you can give us some kind of an indication, maybe what could get immediately worse? Is this your Huawei pull-forward working off? Is this something going on because your distribution strategy is different from your competitors? I guess anything you can give us around the tactical near term environment driving the Q4 guide would be helpful, just given what we have seen over the last year or so in those trends?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Stacy, thanks for the question. Let me take a shot at that. And then Dave will follow-up with other comments. But our sense is that customers are just far more cautious than they were certainly a year ago, but even 90 days ago. And many of them, when talk about the caution, they mentioned the trade tensions that we know have been happening and have been accumulating over the last three or four quarters. And the consistency of that breadth of weakness supports that this is a macro situation that is driving the further weakness that we are seeing.
Dave Pahl
You have got a follow-on?
Stacy Rasgon
I do. So you have talk about evolving your distribution strategy and relationships. Do you think it's possible that any of those activities as you disintermediate more of them maybe having like a near term negative impact on your revenue outlook because you can rely on them less to do things like demand generation and the like? Is there, I guess, any change you have made recently you think could be having any sort of impact on the near term horizon?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Simply in a word, I would just say, no, Stacy. I think establishing a more direct relationship with our customer just yields more rewards than it does the risk. And it gives us greater access to those customers. And you have seen us evolve that over the last several years and we have made investments in order to provide very high levels of service for our customers, especially as we move to a more direct business model. And these investments include the things that you have heard us talk about, the new capabilities and in some cases improved capabilities to our website, e-commerce enhancements for demand creation, inventory consignment programs that we have talked about on the last the last few calls and other things like order fulfillment services. So these improved capabilities combined with our sales and applications organization which by the way is the largest in the semiconductor industry just help us provide great product and great support to our customers. And that's really what we have been focused on.
Thank you. And we will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer
Yes. Thank guys. Thanks for letting me ask questions. Dave, I just want to go back to the embedded. When I look at how your analog business trending, it's about in line with our expectations and quite frankly, what your peer group is doing. But when I look at embedded, it seems to be demonstrably worse. In fact, if Q4 is down sequentially equally across all segments, you will be down peak to trough this cycle in embedded, more so than you were in the 2009 financial crisis when financial markets weren't working properly and companies couldn't actually get funding for inventory. So I just want to kind of go back and kind of understand why you think the embedded business is doing so poorly relative to overall kind of industry trends? Is that really where the comms weakness comes in? If you can help me understand that a little bit better, it would be helpful.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And John, to put it in context, we talked about at the company level, so including analog and embedded that all the markets were week, that when we saw the sectors that make up those markets that most of them were weak. But that weakness was just more pronounced directionally the same but just more pronounced in embedded. And you know, we did see and if you look now just inside of embedded, we saw a more pronounced weakness in automotive and in communications. So again, I think that those types of things need to be measured over longer periods of time. And so I wouldn't judge that business on any one quarter results overall.
You have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer
Yes. Just as a follow-up, just going back to the comms part of the business. So I am just kind of curious, not that the macro is all that strong, but to what extent can you quantify, if at all, the impact from bans? Is this way Huawei having ordered a lot more inventory throughout the year than you thought? Is this a certain company or region? Just on the comms side, any color you can give on the weakness would be helpful.
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think we can't rule out, obviously, you know customers having built inventory in preparations for builds or concerns with the trade tensions. But the weakness that we saw wasn't limited to any region. That was very broad-based. When we look at the largest customers inside of comms equipment, that was across the largest customers. And again, we talked about that it was across the technologies. So it's really broad-based, the weakness. So not just one customer or not just one technology or not just one region. So hopefully that color helps.
Thank you, John. We will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore
Dave, you gave the year-over-year comments and then the sequentials for the comm equipment. But I think we are all trying to solve the main problem of kind of why is your guidance so weak in the fourth quarter? To the extent it provides any clues, could you give us what the quarter-over-quarter sequentials were by the end markets outside of the comm, which you already gave?
Dave Pahl
Sure. Industrial and automotive declined low single digits, Ross. Personal electronics grew midteens and that was based on really just seasonal growth that we would expect to see. We already commented on comms equipment declining about 20%. And then enterprise systems grew in the quarter.
You have a follow-on?
Ross Seymore
Yes. I guess one on the cash return side of things. I know one quarter doesn't necessarily make a trend, but you guys have been ridiculously consistent in a positive way with your buyback over time. I know you raised the dividend this last quarter. But I think the share repurchase was the lowest since I believe the second quarter of 2012, if my model is right. And the aggregate of the two, the dividend and the buyback, were meaningfully less than the free cash flow in the quarter. I know it's not just one quarter, but is there anything at that explains why the buyback was significantly lower than it's been in any time in recent history?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I would tell you and that is I will take you back to our capital management strategy and our objectives to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And as you pointed out, we do that through buybacks and dividends. And on a trailing 12-month basis which is a better way to look at all these things, to give you just a better trend of what's going on, we have returned $7.4 billion of cash and our free cash flow has been $6 billion during that time. So we have returned 122% of free cash during that time. So a pretty healthy amount. And in the last quarter, we returned or we bought back $456 million. As long as the stock price is below our assessment of intrinsic, we will be buying back shares and we did buy a healthy amount in third quarter.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. And I will just add to that, that as Rafael said, it's quite best to look at the free cash flow metrics on a trailing 12-month basis, as there is seasonality. Third and fourth quarter tend to be stronger than first and second on that. So that usually provides a better insight.
Thank you Ross. And we will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore
Yes. I wonder if you could give us more color, I mean you have talked about your customers being more cautious. But to what degree do you think that's demand being softer that's different inventory behavior? And I guess on the flipside, I mean it doesn't seem like you are seeing a lot of inventory accumulation around the tariff activities. But just could you just generally comment on the state of your customers' inventories as you move to the last quarter? Thanks.
Dave Pahl
Yes. Joe, I will make a comment and if Rafael wants to add something to it, certainly jump in, Rafael. But you know, when we look at inventory in the channel, it was actually down a little bit sequentially, still at about four-and-a-half weeks. So really not changing much overall. We still have about two-thirds of our revenue supported by consignment overall. So we know that inventory remains at zero because of those consignment programs. So they continue to be in a healthy state. The rest of that, we can't see into our customers' inventories and down channel. So our visibility really ends at that point.
Rafael?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. The only thing I would add, I can sense that you collectively are unsatisfied with our answers and I understand that. We have close to 100,000 different customers and we sell about 100,000 different products. It's difficult to pinpoint any one thing. But the sense we get talking to those customers, getting input from them, from our salespeople and all the touch points that we have is that the weakness is broad-based, is due to macro events and specifically the trade tensions.
And if you think about when there is tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious and they pull back. And we are at the very end of our long supply chain and when the ones at the very front pullback, it becomes a traffic jam. So our sense is that is what's happening in the marketplace. But we will see what other companies will report over time and we will get a clear picture over the next several weeks and really quarters, because this thing we have been in it for now four quarters and it's going to be longer than that.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-on, Joe?
Joe Moore
Yes. And thanks for the color. I do appreciate you guys clarifying what's going on. In terms of the wafer start reduction in the fourth quarter, can you just talk about, I guess normally you have talked about a 70% incremental gross margin in both directions, anything kind of different as you think about Q4 because of the fact of that wafer start comment that you made?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Actually, no, not any different to the larger degree. We have talked about 70% to 75% fall through. And that's a guide. It could be a little less, a little more. So that's probably how you want to think about it on a year-on-year basis for fourth quarter. We did lower wafer starts in third quarter inside of the quarter and we are lowering those further into fourth quarter. And that's a capital allocation decision. When we do that we save cash, right. And we have, to a larger degree, built the buffer strategy that we have talked about. So we will save cash as we do that and that makes sense for the owners of the company. There is cash that's freed up for other purposes. That will hit the GPM line, but it will do so about as expected. So as I say, you have seen a fall through that we have talked about in the big scheme of things.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Joe. We will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri
Hi. Thanks. Q4 OpEx is usually down low to mid singles. I am just trying to see if that's the right number for December that's in the guidance?
Dave Pahl
OpEx, well, first remember, the objective of OpEx is to fuel our long term growth and these are long term investments that pay off over many, many years, in many cases decades. So that's how we think about. In this environment, we are cautious and we want to be prudent. But we are not cutting back on those long term investments.
On a trailing 12-month basis, OpEx has been running pretty steady at about $3.2 billion for at least a year or so, if you look at trailing 12-month at the end of every quarter for the last three or four quarters. And it is overall is down about 1% versus a year ago. But of course, revenue has been dropping more than that. So then, as a percent of revenue, it's gone up a little bit. So now it's at 20%. And that's well within our expectation, our guide of 20% to 25% for that metric.
You have a follow up?
Timothy Arcuri
Sure. I guess with respect to the loadings commentary, does it make you rethink the timing on the new 300 millimeter fab, if you can give us an update there? Thanks.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Sure. So first, let me remind you, of course when it comes to CapEx, particularly for that fab, it's all about driving long term revenue growth and extending our manufacturing advantage, including 300 millimeter. And that is one of our key competitive advantages. We are now in the process of building a parking structure that will be complete in the first half of next year. Once we build that, that will enable us to build the building for the next 300 millimeter factory. Our plan continues to be to build that building within the next few years.
And as a reminder, that will cost $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years as we build that building. And $600 million to $700 million, it is a sizable amount. But the big expense comes from the equipment that would follow. And in fact an even bigger one will be the opportunity cost of not having that available, if there s, or when there is growth on the other side of these things. So we think about all of those things and based on that we have laid our plans at the moment.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Tim. We can go to our next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from CJ Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead.
CJ Muse
Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to revisit comments around China and the potential for pull-ins. If I look back at your June quarter, that business was up about 6% year-on-year where everything else was down 1%. And so I guess as you look back and you think forward, do you have a sense that was in fact pull-ins in the prior quarters and that's perhaps exacerbating what you are seeing into the December quarter?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think that, so first I spent eight years of my career in sales and I like the job. I never once took a double order or saw a customer do a pull-in, right. But so certainly wouldn't rule that out as a possibility. But I think more of what you are seeing there is just seasonality as customers prepare more of the PE products, our products are shipped into China than any other region. So that has an effect that's in there as well. So again, I won't rule it out. But you have got some seasonality that's going on with that.
You have a follow-on?
CJ Muse
I do. You talked broad based weakness. But I was hoping perhaps you could narrow in on auto and give a little more color on what you are seeing there, either geographically or by sub-segment?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So we have got five sectors that are inside of that. All the sectors saw weakness. I made the comment that if you look at the sectors across industrial and even personal electronics, that most of those sectors were down. So automotive was no different from that front. And I would say that from a regional standpoint, we saw weakness across all of the regions. So nothing really significant there to spike out.
Okay. Thank you CJ. And with that, we have got time for one last caller. Operator?
Operator
Our last question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Tore Svanberg
Yes. Thank you. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the linearity of the orders? So obviously there's been some weakening. And I am just wondering if you already started to see that this summer? Or was it sort of something more that came later in the quarter?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So I would say that it was weak throughout the quarter. It wasn't last couple of week or last 30-day phenomenon. I would also point out we have got two-thirds of our revenue on consignment. So in those arrangements, we get the order and ship them instantaneously at the same time. So revenues and orders really reflect each other for the most part.
Do you have follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg
Yes. I had a follow-on for Rafael. So you have done a tremendous job on gross margin. Revenues down 12% year-over-year but gross margin only down 90 basis points. And now your inventory days were down as well sequentially. I know you talked a little bit about the factory loadings in Q4. But should we think about some sort of a inventory days target that you want to run the business at next few quarters?
Rafael Lizardi
So good question. Let me first step back and remind you how we think about inventory, okay. Inventory, the objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence and improve our asset utilization. We have a guide of 115 to 145, but those are not concrete barriers, right. It's just a guide there. We are going to do the right thing for the business.
So for example, in this situation, in the current environment, even though we have decreased those wafer starts, it is likely that we go above the top of that range or it's at least possible that we do just because of where the revenue midpoint is. Now we are not going to go drive the wafer starts in a draconian way to just to stay within those guidelines.
That would not make sense in one quarter. But over one, two, three quarters then the idea is to, that guidelines just provide an area where we should aim at and we can achieve our objectives, the inventory objectives I talked about, while deploying and allocating capital in the best way that benefits the interest of the long term owners of the company.
Dave Pahl
So with that, let me just finish with a few comments on some key items for you to remember. We will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products and industrial and automotive, the best markets. Next, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company. Lastly, we continue to believe growing free cash flow per share over the long term. It's why we will maximize value for the owners of the company.

Q - Ross Seymore
Alright, good morning everybody. Welcome to the second day of the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference. I’m Ross Seymore, Head of the Semiconductor Research here in the U.S. 
Today, we are fortunate to kick it off with the Chairman, President and CEO of Texas Instruments, Mr. Rich Templeton. As always, if you have questions, raise your hand, we’ll get a mic to you towards the end because there are people on the webcast. 
And with that Rich, thank you for kicking it off this morning. At the risk of you not commenting a bunch on it, I’ll start the same way I've started with a bunch of other companies, the macro environment and the trade environment has clearly had an impact on the semiconductor industry as a whole. So with TI being the largest analog player in the world, I just wanted to get a read from you on how you are viewing the macro situation today versus say at the beginning of the year. 
Rich Templeton
Yeah Ross, as [inaudible] we’re really getting going this morning. Really no different than what you heard from Dave and Rafael on the July earnings call. We came off a strong ‘17 and ’18, you saw things slow in a different part of ’18, so you've got a semiconductor, pretty classic semiconductor cycle working its way through in a pretty orderly fashion, and then put on top of that, the uncertainty due to trade and the good news is we are going to make a forecast [indiscernible], so we are prepared to deal with whatever 2020 wants to deliver on that front. 
Ross Seymore
And what you guys think of the duration of the downturn. Dave on all the calls has been, and Rafael have been very consistent saying historically a typical downturn is four to five quarters of negative comps and you guys have been saying that since the beginning of this one. Another way to look at it is the shape of the recovery and some of the definition of the downturn is not just year-over-year being down, but also kind of sub-seasonality. When we come out of this, how do you judge what the shape is likely to be and what sort of strategic steps the TI makes to prepare for either the bonanza side of things or something that's a little more muted. 
Rich Templeton
Yeah, you know I’m on – I think this now you know of cycle 10 and almost for 40 years in the business and there is no predictable pattern of what will it look like and so you know you have watched us over the years as well. When you see things slow, get the operating plans right, you know get the inventories right, make sure replenishing, and make sure you can handle any combinations that you know could show up, be it slow or drawn out, because there's a macro issue on top or if people have over compensated, ‘09 was probably the best example. They turned down so hard, it was really a strong snap back, but clearly this one is deeper than ‘14 and ‘15, but nowhere near the deficits we saw back in ’09, which is a great expectation. So we’ll just make sure that we’re able to handle whatever they want it to be. 
Ross Seymore
And the last question on a macro side, somewhat as more on the trade side with Huawei. You guys I think in your last call talked about adhering to all the rules of course, stopping shipping and then restarting it. Talk a little bit about how you are able to ship, just because we've heard from so many different companies that have given us so many different answers on who can ship and why. So what allows TI to be able to ship its products? 
Rich Templeton
Yeah, you know I think it's very much and you said it well. We make sure – I think many of the companies, all make sure that you are abiding by the letter of the law and make sure you understand what the terms are and then once you get done looking at that versus the products, okay you could move forward. And so you know we did that through look and were able to make those dispositions and resumed, I forget if it was three or four weeks after you know that May cut-off on that front. 
And I think you've heard when I just listened to other company, you know both the earnings and in general, I think everybody's you know followed it pretty much at the same way. So I think it will depend on your product mix more than anything. 
Ross Seymore
Really had for some companies a temporary disruption in the demand patterns, but it also has had some differing impacts on the supply side of things. Have you noticed any difference in the amount of channel inventory people are holding for fear of that, and has that adjusted anything as far as how you guys are addressing this, [shrinking part] of your business that goes to the channel? 
Rich Templeton
Yeah, I'm careful and I think you've heard this again from Dave for many years, no one will ever say they've seen inventories built up until the day demand is not as high and then they say oops, you know inventories are built up. We don't see anything that stands out on that, but I am also careful of back to that first comment of thinking you have that much insight into it.
We are advantaged as you know quite well and you talked about it. Because we've been aggressive with the consignment, because we keep a lot of that in our hands or on our books and you watch the days that we actually have in the channel be lower than, say any of our competitors. Even if it's up, it’s not going to be something that mixes us up too badly. 
Ross Seymore
So you mentioned about the consignment side of things. So why don’t we pivot to a more TI specific comment and topic. I think you’ve said about two-thirds of your revenue runs through consignment these days and two-thirds of the – if the revenue goes through. Why did you make the original decision to change more to consignment? 
Rich Templeton
So I think the – it's probably more helpful to back up as opposed to a consignment or distribution only, go back and think about the commentary you hear from us of really trying to build a business model centered on four competitive advantages: manufacturing, technology, breadth of our products, reach of our channel and diversity and longevity. And we're very, very consistent on that. We either want to be building those advantages stronger or leveraging. 
And so if you think about the reach that we have in terms of the channel, we have always had a long term belief that building closer direct relationships with our customers really was going to be a helpful thing for the long term. So think about the things that you've watched: consignment inventory, changes in distribution registration programs, whatever it was five, six, seven years ago, continuing to build our strength in our sales force, building mass market sales teams, investments in TI.com, many of the things you’ve talked about for years when you visited and we’ve got together, and so to me this is all part of just to continuum of evolving forward and it’s just very logical. 
We are going to be better served of inventories in one place and we are going to be better served when we can truly see the demand of the true end customer.
And that way you eliminate the buffering or the buffering of buffering, a lack of visibility of what true demand is, and it's going to let us run the business better and I think do a better job for our customers in the long term. 
So to me the consignment efforts, the latest phase that we are working through now, are just part of that, you know evolution of us getting closer to our customers and it's going to have a lot of advantages long term. 
Ross Seymore
Were there any negatives on the revenue side, in making that transition? 
Rich Templeton
Sure. I think Rafael talked about it in the last call that you know when you bring down, recognize revenue that’s an inventory outlet channel and you are moving it internal, you will have a temporary, okay its actually in some ways you would say permanent that you are bringing that revenue down. But you know to me it just gets closer to what the consumption is and that's always a good thing as well. 
Ross Seymore
Do you believe any of the reach benefits that the distribution partners would claim as a strategic advantage of using them as something that you sacrifice or is TI scale a unique offset to that? 
Rich Templeton
You know look at the – you know when you narrated some of the debate, I think back five and six years ago when we stopped the design registration, we said they just don’t have influence and look at what our market share has done and especially mass markets like industrial and its only gone in one direction since then. 
And so -- and we're uniquely, that's not a statement for everybody in the semiconductor industry, we have it because we plan for that, built out a sales force, we build out an applications team, we've built our capabilities on TI.com and as a result of that we can do a better job taking care of our customers directly. 
In the end customers just want the work done efficiently and cost effectively, and when it comes to selecting components and getting them into production, ramping them, they'd rather do that directly with the suppliers and we are in a position to build and do that. 
Ross Seymore
Would you believe aggregate inventory, what we see on your books and what you see as in the channel has really changed much during this evolution or is it just more internal, less external and it’s the same overall. 
A - Rich Templeton
Probably hasn't changed that much. I'm careful because I haven't done, got some calculations on that, but I think the more interesting question longer term is when we get to the other side of all these transitions, is it going to let us be even more efficient, because we have things in one place that we can support customers throughout the world from that, you know one centralized area meeting. They will give great lead-times, great availability, you know great service so we can react to customers. I've got a feeling we can be pretty efficient doing that, but it’s a little early to make a projection on that. 
Ross Seymore
And when you get to the other side, is the other side defined by that final third of the business, being consignment as well. So there is really no channel so to speak or is there some balance between the two at the end stage. 
Rich Templeton
No, I think there is always, you know when it comes to channels, customers are the ones that need to be able to make decisions on what they want to do. We just want to make sure they have a really good option of – if they can do business directly with us, it will be something we support and they'll see advantages in it and if they choose to do that, then that’s how we’ll support them long term. 
Ross Seymore
And do you think, especially in the analog market, that products have very long life cycles, obsolete capability of risk. Is there such a thing as caring too much inventory? 
Rich Templeton
No. If you look at – you know and we’ve seen it and I don’t care if it’s the TI product lines, you can go back to the Burr-Brown acquisitions, the UNITRD acquisitions, both the products from National, you do great analog parts. These things are around for 10, 15, 20, 25 years and so that ability to be very calculated on how you manage inventory internally when you've got standard products that many customers use, you know what five years of run rate of consumption looks like, it lets you actually be very thoughtful in terms of some combination of die-bank/finished goods, produce great service metrics, but also have very low risk of obsolescence. 
Now that’s different than if you're in you know big customer, big vertical, custom market where you know a device is built for only one customer, that’s a very different you know world you have to play around. This one we're going towards I think it’s going to be a very good one. 
Ross Seymore
If we looked at TI down the road, the consignment is probably higher in the mix of those more fragmented customers would be higher, larger customers lower and that the whole industrial automotive focus is better. 
Another key part of this is manufacturing side. I guess we are one of the first to go to the – if not the first, to go to 300 millimeter. Right now you look like you are moving to the next phase of that. Talk a little bit about the next move to 300 millimeters. I think you've talked about within the next few years was the discussion you signed to do that expansion down in Texas and then it seems like it's not going to be this year, it'll be sometime after. Has anything changed in the timing of that due to demand or is it just this is the progression it takes to roll out with taxes, all the sorts of jurisdictions. 
Rich Templeton
Ross you have seen us in the past and think about prior generations away for fed. You know we qualified our FAB 1 clean room. I think it was 2007 and we didn’t tool it and ramp it up until late 2009, 2010. And you know the clean room is not cheap, but it actually is compared to when you put all the capital and people in it and so that flexibility, you’re not being worried about having a clean room a few years early is just not something that has bothered me and it won’t bother me for the cycle and you go back to even DMOS6 back in 1996 with we put that one in. 
But you know we’ll be in a position and I'm going to guess that if we have to ramp that thing by 2021 or the end of 2021 we’ll be a position to do that. You know you can apply any growth what if scenarios to where we are and figure out, do we need to buy 2121 or 2024, that's all close enough as far as I'm concerned.
I do like the fact and I think you can appreciate this, that by having it next to an existing facility, the granularity of the capacity additions and the staffing additions put us in a position to be very responsive to demand, where if you go build at a Greenfield site, you will essentially have to tool with a third of that factory to get it even running. 
Well, if it’s sitting right next to an existing one, you can add critical tools for that new facility and deal with your capacity and the incremental cost is actually very proportionate to the revenue. So I think it also puts us in a position to be very responsive with fixed costs as we bring that thing online. 
Ross Seymore
One aspect of the fixed cost that you guys have been very opportunistic on with the fab years past is selling used equipment and downturns have been useful in that regard. 
Rich Templeton
You have to enjoy life. 
Ross Seymore
Exactly! Is that occurring right now or is the equipment still free, because it seems like everything is still too tight. 
Rich Templeton
You know it’s one of these things that you know when you get asked questions of will there be excess equipment? Yes, there will be. You know the investors will probably be in a lousier mood when that time comes, but that's okay, we'll take advantage of it. 
So – and there's still some out there, there is just nowhere near what we saw back in 2009, 2010 and 2011 when we would pick it up from older equipment and do fab, you know a bunch from around the world, we can still do some now. But you know even I think it was at last year's Capital Management Call, Rafael basically said we're assuming a higher percent of new equipment for this next round and that doesn't mean it has to be that, it means we're assuming that. And if we can find used equipment because things soften up, then that's great, we'll bring it in. 
But the beauty behind this is we could have every dollar spent on new equipment and the incremental margin and pay back on 300 millimeter is stunning. The real impact economically is getting that way for diameter leverage. 
Ross Seymore
The last question on that manufacturing side of things, when you think of the 300 millimeter side, do you think the first benefit has been more to TI’s margins or market share? 
Rich Templeton
You know to keep life simple, it’s a margin answer, because you know in the end when you can get the dye costs down as you've seen the calculations by at least 40% and you’ve watched our fall-through on incremental revenue over the past four and five years and I think it’s reflected, the advantage of having that. So the majority of that is just the margin you can operate it at. 
Are there technical benefits of lithography and precision and speed and different parameters in the process, yes but it's at the margin. A little easier answer to that is, it’s a gross margin benefit. 
Ross Seymore
And actually, I missed out one last one on this. Some other companies have tried to obtained the 300 millimeter benefit often times with foundry. Have you noticed any change in the competitive environment, and as of that more pricing pressure from the competition or is it still a performance centric market. 
Rich Templeton
Its performance centric and I think more importantly as last time I checked, the Foundries aren’t terrible operations in terms of what they sell the wafers to folks that. So you look at the profitability of the foundry suppliers and you know – and that's the beauty of our model, is we press you know Kyle Flessner and his tem, we want you as cost effective or better than the foundries and then you've got the benefit of that plus no market, and it's a wonderful thing. 
Ross Seymore
Let me pivot over to a little bit more in the competitive environment, but directly on to the M&A side of things. Back when I started following you guys 20 years ago, TI was one of the most active on M&A and the analog space. UNITRD and Burr-Brown and then a decade or so later you guys did national. But you really haven’t participated in this decade so much, choosing more to buy your own stock, instead of somebody else’s. So I guess a couple questions on that, has the competitive intensity changed as some of the scale has ramped up with some of the competition many years in ADIs of the world. 
Rich Templeton
You know and it's not to avoid this specific nature of that, as I take it more to – I think the past 10 and 15 years have been destructive and meaning, if you are a well-run semiconductor company, more focused on what you do well, less dabbling, we’ve certainly done that, but a number of other companies have as well. 
Is M&A part of that? I'd say yes it is, but in general and again, you followed the industry for 20 years; you’ve seen things from late 90s. You know low run companies have done a better job over the past 10 or 12 years, because it's a more constructive environment. It doesn't mean it's any less competitive, we’ve got good competitors, we go out and do battle with them on a daily basis, but the discipline in terms of R&D spending, in terms of capital spending, you just see a better disciplined industry compared to 20 years ago. 
My guess is the environment is going to continue that way for probably the next 10 and M&A is just part of that, not the majority of that is my guess. 
Ross Seymore
So you think it’s the natural maturing of the industry and people optimizing accordingly. 
Rich Templeton
You know, and again you’ve lived it. You’ve watched you know most investors in many companies in denial from the late 90s for 10 years of when are we are going to go back to 10% and 15% growth. You know the fact is the growth is more 5% or 6% or whatever you know number you want to apply and once people, you know get adjusted to that, you know things have you know I think got a little better discipline. 
Ross Seymore
Unless you talk about just, a year ago when people thought we're going to grow 10% or 15% then to. 
Rich Templeton
The new norm. 
Ross Seymore
Yeah, exactly. It hasn’t worked out so far for them, but… So do you think bigger is better in both analog and micro controllers? Is that scale – I know you believe it's a benefit to you, but others, you think it's one of the core tenets that you have, other people trying to emulate that, I would think, would something to competitive intensity. I know we just talked about it; it’s just a better behaved industry, but I'm surprised that you don't see it either microcontroller or the analog side or any different behavior. 
Rich Templeton
Yeah I think, you know the industries behave a little differently, but it's not because the scale or that other thing. 
Is bigger better? Yes to a degree, meaning you’ve got to get above certain minimums, okay. So if you think about the competitive advantages I mentioned earlier, the scale to be able to play a 300 millimeter internal game, it's hard to see even our largest analog competitors ever deciding to go back to that, so I'm going to guess they don't. 
The breadth of our product portfolio, even with M&A our largest, nearest competitors still can't dent what we do. The affordability of building out a sales and applications channel and reach okay, it's just not something that people are probably likely to do any day soon. So as long as you are above that level, scale really matters, but you know internally we spent a lot of time talking about how you build the operation stronger, you aim it at the best markets and the outcome is being bigger, as opposed to let me go get bigger. It doesn't get you to stronger places, but you do have to be you know at critical sizes to be above that. 
Part of the reason that we're so, you know I’m going to use the word confident in our competitive advantages is we've looked at greatly on how easy is it to replicate. And you know for somebody to really build out what we have built out, they probably got a goal to put two or three more companies together, let alone put together a wafer fab and an assembly test operation, let alone put together enterprise level processes that let them to operate that. That's a good backlog work to say the least. 
So I think it's difficult to replicate and I think we've seen that and I think our free – you know to me the ultimate test of your competitive advantages is does your free cash flow per share grow faster than your best competitors over the long term. And you know we've been able to do that for the past 10 or 15 years, real test is can you go do it for another 10. 
Ross Seymore
Only pivot off the M&A and the competition side of things and talk a little bit about the product strategy. Guys have narrowed things down over the years, big in analog and then microcontrollers as well. It seems like the microcontroller side you've decided to, but the analog commitment seems to be bigger than the MC and I might be over stating that. But talk about the relative importance of those two markets and why the growth rates seemingly have differed at times between the two. 
Rich Templeton
So I think there’s you know a couple of pieces inside. The highest level would really and I know its dangerous analogy, but you know which of your children do you love more and the answer is all of them, okay, and it's not just out of love and support. Its they can all contribute to the long term growth of free cash flow. 
So it's not – you know it’s for a very tangible reason. But I think the embedded business, which is a very different business than the analog business is one that can be successful and successful over the long term. Its financials will be different, look at margins and people ask well, are you going to – what does it take to get embedded up to analog margins. Well, we are not trying to press it, we are just trying to get it stronger each year and make sure it's growing and make sure it's contributing from a fall-through point of view. 
In the nearer term, meeting the past year or you know change when you've seen revenue growth differences between analog and embedded, we’ve historically seen differences. It's hard to go explain them all, is it customer mix, is it you know things happening in the channel. But I also think and again, you look at all these companies closer than I do; competitive microcontroller companies have been a little softer from a revenue point of view as well and so I don't think it's TI specific embedded trends on that. 
So my guess is, we keep track of that longer term, you know all these things will return to pretty parallel behaviors, because you know embedded was as you recall a great grower, late ’16, ’17 and ’18, heck it was growing better than analog during that timeframe for us, now it’s a little softer. 
Ross Seymore
Let me pivot. Well, about 10 minutes left, so if anybody does have a question raise your hands at this point where I'll keep my eyes open, but because there is so many hands going up right now, I'll make sure to continue with my question. 
So let’s pivot over to the end market side of things a bit. You for many, many years talked about the focus on the industrial analog market, but there's other high performance markets that people focus on that have been great drivers of growth and profitability and free cash flow etcetera, like the data center market and the common infrastructure market. How did you guys chose to do the industrial and auto versus things like the data center and comp side, when neither one has those kind of consumer behaviors that earlier you tend to avoid. 
Rich Templeton
That’s fair, but you know I go back and just think of the industry over 40 odd years and again, you’ve watched a lot of us, you had mainframes and min-computers that drove a great deal of the unit growth and market growth in the 60s and 70s. You moved into, in some ways communications at a phase, but if you really look at it, personal electronics, you know where there were 20, 30, 40 million units in the early 90s, there is 2.5 billion units annually between Smartphones, Tablets, PC's and whatever. 
But, you know you just have to sit back and say, over the next 20 years what's going to be the best secular growth opportunity and that doesn't mean we're not going to participate in com infrastructure, it’s an important market, it’s a good market, we're going to you know do better than our – you know hold our own on that, same in data center. 
But you know the opportunities of industrial and automotive are just different and you're going to sit back I believe 10 years from now or 20 years now and people are going to say, if you weren't in, you couldn’t play and you couldn't compete long term. And it's all for a very simple reason of a content story and that is if you take these, the end equipments that are mostly mechanical or a combination of electro mechanical, and you work to make them smarter, use less power, be safer, be earlier to use, you know pick your variable, what are you going to put inside that equipment, and I’ll put semiconductors on them. 
So I believe and I think the date is playing out that way even over the past five or six years for us. We are fortunately doing well in good markets and you know now our job is to make sure that you know we keep driving at that. The combination, I think industrial was up you know mid-30s, automotive up in low 20s, combination was above 55%, 56% last year and we keep pushing that up. 
Ross Seymore
And that’s exactly where I was going to go next. If I looked at TI five years down the road, do you think industrial, let's split him for now, but you could answer to together if you wish, but you think that combination is bigger and which one of the two do you think is going to be bigger percentage of TI five years from now relative to today. 
Rich Templeton
Oh! I think the industrial is the biggest business today and is going to be the biggest business five years and 10 years from now. I think automotive will keep pace, okay, but those will grow larger. But we are also careful internally. We do not go around with a percent of business mix as a goal. As you give engineers that and they've got two variables they could mess with and we don’t want them messing with the other one. 
And so you know we want to hold our positions in personal electronics, we want to hold our positions in communications infrastructure and enterprise and then on top of that, we want to grow those absolute businesses in industrial and automotive. It’s what we’ve done for the past five years and is what we're challenging everybody internal to really double down on for the next five. 
Ross Seymore
When you mentioned that why you've targeted the industrial and automotive side, I think the automotive side people get the content argument, pretty obvious. 
Rich Templeton
Visible, yep.
Ross Seymore
My car has more content than today's car. On the industrial side, I think if you conceptually hit it, but it doesn't seem quite as [that’s] immediately to think about, but if you think about that trends like factory automation, more electronics, that whole content is dynamic. You think that takes the market that used to grow kind of mid-single digit-ish and accelerate that over the next 10 years that grows faster than the last 10 years. 
Rich Templeton
So, first I think the characterization that you give is very accurate, that it's not as easy to touch or feel. It's also not as easy to analyze. You know think of your world of – let me try to get into equipments and break it down, because you know you have State House Industrial, these starts in what we’ve got 13 sectors and you’re like oh crap! You know where we are going now?
Well, and then inside of that its literally 100s if not 1000s of end equipments and so the ability to analyze that is hard. By the way, the ability to attack that takes very unique capabilities in terms of sales teams, TI.com and the systems to get to those, to that reach. But the beauty of it, also very difficult for your competitors to take if you've gotten there and so I think it has great dynamics. 
In terms of the growth potential, let’s stay with the, is it 5% historically, I don't know the exact number. I think it's got the ability to at least maintain that level, meaning we could have a pretty modest GDP and content growth just puts a multiplier on top of that. So do you have a 5% or 6% or 7% you know industrial growth environment, I think that's quite likely. Even potentially maybe with a questionable global economy and I don't mean just 2020 or in the near term, but you know depending on your view longer term and then by the way can we do a little better than that. 
And so those to me are encouraging opportunity and the good news is we don't have to establish credibility that we can do it. We're carrying a pretty good 5-year, 7-year track record in both industrial and in automotive that the things we’re doing are working and we're continuing to invest even more aggressively in those extended further. 
Ross Seymore
Last end market question for you. You mentioned about kind of holding serve on the com infrastructure and the personal electronic side of things. In com infrastructure people often times ask me if TI is taking its focus off that business and is losing share for some reason or another. How are you guys attacking that market now and between the embedded and the analog side, what might be different in your approach today versus say 3G, 4G transition. 
Rich Templeton
Yeah, so you know we've been very clear and I think we said at the starting, I forget, five or six ago, where we said look, when you look at the macro trend, secular CapEx expenditures by operators is not going to keep going up. Just go look at their budgets and their capital expenditures and so it's just to me the classic disciplined mistake of well, the market's going to stop growing, let me double down and try to make up for it with market share, which is usually when people do very bad things. 
But what we said is very clear and that is we're going to bring down the investment on the embedded side, because that baseband portion of the business is not going to grow. But we're going to take up the analog investment, because what they will do is try to get more capacity, more spectral efficiency across the spectrum they have and so we love what's going on with 5G. It’s growing and our analog participation in it is wonderful. You actually see that in the numbers, okay. 
When you try to understand a little bit of why is embedded weaker and analog growing stronger, that’s not all, but it's certainly one factor and so I think we're going to continue to do very well on the analog portion of that com infrastructure business, and so I think it’s going to be an important business for a long time for us. 
Ross Seymore
Then the last topic I want to hit on in the time we have is, it gets us all the way down to the free cash flow side of things is kind of the key tenant and the TI story.
A - Rich Templeton
The easiest thing to understand.
Q - Ross Seymore
You guys have done – if I think about the metric that gets you down to free cash flow, obviously the revenue side, margin, FX, those sorts of things, you kind of hit on all of them except for the margin side. Operating expenses you guys run as tight as anyone, that if 20 years ago somebody told me that TI could run with 10% of sales an R&D guy would have said ‘No Way,’ but you guys have proven that is very sustainable. 
If I'm thinking the next five or 10 years going forward, what do you think the biggest driver of gross margin contributor to free cash flow and not just we know revenues, we know fall through rates, but any other sort of levers that you think your unique to TI and is driving that metric north. 
Rich Templeton
Yes, so I won't surprise you with you know the answer. I still think if you’re trying to put round numbers on it, 70% to 75% fall through on the way in or on the way out is a good number to use. 
Yes, we understand that the past five years have probably been over on the fall through on the way in, but I think you see the advantages of that 300 millimeter product mix in the number of things you’ve touched on and you know it very well. And then on either the absolute gross margin or the absolute free cash flow margin, you've heard us say it and I’ll repeat it here. We do not spend time riveted on that. I care far more about free cash flow per share of growth rate over the long term. 
Now, if margin can increase at the same time that revenue is growing, we're not going to stop the gross margin or the free cash flow margin going up, but we spent no time trying to maximize those. What owners really want is – and you give us great free cash flow per share of growth over five years and 10 years; that's what generates rewards for the owners. 
So that's very much where that focus is. We've made good progress on the margins and the absolute free cash flow per share growth rate and you know we’ll stay focused on that going forward. 
Ross Seymore
Great! With that… [Cross Talk]
A - Rich Templeton
Hopefully I haven’t surprised you with the response on that.
Q - Ross Seymore
No bonanza surprises at all.
A - Rich Templeton
You’re shameful! 
Q - Ross Seymore
Yeah, I know. Thank you, Rich.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' 2Q 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI’s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
For today’s call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I’ll be covering the following topics: First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the second quarter and second, some details by segment and end market. Rafael will then review: Profitability, capital management results, and then the outlook, after that we will open the call for Q&A.
Starting with the high-level summary of our second quarter financial results. The quarter progressed about as we expected, with revenue decreasing 9% from a year ago due to broad-based weakness. In our core businesses, Analog revenue declined 6% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 16% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses’ year-on-year growth decelerated.
Earnings per share were $1.36, including a $0.07 benefit for items not in our original guidance. The benefit includes $0.04 due to the previously announced sale of our Greenock, Scotland fab, with the balance primarily due to discrete tax benefits. With that backdrop, I’ll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. We remain committed to returning all our free cash flow to owners.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.9% of revenue, up from 36.6% a year ago. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to our owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners.
Moving on, I’ll now provide some details on the second quarter by segment and end market. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue declined 6% due to declines in High Volume, Power and Signal Chain. Embedded Processing revenue declined by 16% from the year-ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, Processors and Connected Microcontrollers.
Next, I’ll provide some insight into this quarter’s performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive together declined upper-single digits due to broad-based weakness. Personal electronics declined low-double digits also due to broad-based weakness. In communications equipment, revenue declined sequentially, but was about even from a year ago versus a weak compare. And lastly, enterprise systems declined.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.36 billion, or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $810 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 21.1% of revenue, within our expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.57 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long-term.
Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of this year, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Restructuring charges/other was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our Greenock, Scotland facility.
Operating profit was $1.51 billion, or 41.1% of revenue. Operating profit was down 12% from a year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 43.7%, down from 47% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 33.5%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time.
Other income and expense was $52 million benefit, up $28 million primarily due to investment gains and tax-related items. Net income in the second quarter was $1.31 billion, or $1.36 per share, which included a $0.07 benefit for items that were not in our prior outlook, as we’ve discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.80 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $284 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.93 billion.
In the second quarter, we paid $722 million in dividends and repurchased $863 million of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.59 billion. In total, we have returned $8.01 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 47% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.22 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. Total debt is $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%.
Inventory days were 143, up eight days from a year-ago, and down one-day sequentially. We’re pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work in both of these areas will continue in the third quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory and will manage it with our long-term objectives in mind.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.31 to $1.53, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% for 2019.
In closing, we have just completed our third quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. As we stated last quarter, if you look at the last 30 years of history in our industry, cycles are always different, but typically you could see four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before year-on-year growth resumes. Again, we are not trying to forecast the cycle, but simply offer some historical perspective.
Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived products.
We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
"
2019-07-23,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, when you reported three months ago, I think things we’re looking somewhat more downbeat. And I was curious, Rafael or Dave, how would you characterize the current environment. Is it similar? Is it better? Is it worse? I'm just trying to put your Q3 outlook which is 3% to 4% sequential growth. It's below seasonal trend, but it's still up sequentially. So, I'm just going to get a better sense of how you're seeing the broader environment versus three months ago?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I'll start, and if Rafael wants to add anything, he's welcome too. I think as we stated, the quarter came in about as we expected and that was really across the board. Really all the end markets performed about as we had expected. We’ve just completed our third quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. And I think that if you look at history, things are always different when you look at cyclicality, but I think things are performing as we would expect.
Rafael Lizardi
The only thing I would add is we're ready for any scenario. The economy strengthens, we're ready. If it run sideways or if it weakens, we're ready. And that's both a strategic comment on how we position the company, focus on auto and industrial and analog products inside of that, but also operationally with our inventory strategy and other things that we're doing to continue to strengthen the company.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow-on to that?
Vivek Arya
Yes, thanks, Dave. So, for my follow-on, I'm curious the sales to China, how is the environment there? I assume that you don't have a lot of direct specific exposure to Huawei. But what's the demand environment I guess in China and outside of China? But are conditions better outside of China? And within China, how is the demand environment outside of Huawei?
Dave Pahl
So, I think we've said before that Huawei is about 3% to 4% of our revenue overall. It's a mix of comms equipment and some handset in there and some other products. And if you look at comms equipment overall, it's 11% of our revenue. We had seen some nice growth in our 5G products, as we've talked about before. And if you look from a regional standpoint, I'd say there's nothing unusual going on.
We've talked about that in the past when there was. And certainly, if you look at where we ship product, that's not always indicative of actual end demand or – and look-through those economies, meaning we may ship into one region and that may get packaged up and shipped to another region before it's actually consumed. So overall, about the regions, they came in as we expected and nothing unusual. We didn't see anything unusual this quarter. So, thank you for that.
We’ll go to next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We are here now from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
Okay. Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. Guys, based on the comments that you just made, it appears as though your view on the cycle hasn't really changed over the past couple of months. That said, I think you guys decided to delay the new fab. So just curious what kind of thought process went into the decision to push the fab?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So just to clarify, we said back in our February capital management call and really have been saying since then, that we planned to begin building that next factory in the next few years, and that hasn't changed. There was a filing and it was a proposed amendment to a local tax abatement schedule that has caused some confusion on that topic. But just to say again, as we said back in February, those plans hadn't changed. Do you have a follow-on?
Toshiya Hari
I do. Thanks Dave. And then just going back to the U.S., China situation, I realize your business tends to be very sticky. But has the backdrop impacted your ability to conduct business in China at all? Or have you sensed any – just the market share in your business? Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
No. This is Rafael. No, not at all.
Dave Pahl
Yes, and I'd just say that our markets, because they're diverse and you see market share doesn't move around quickly, it's just good quality markets. And one of our competitive advantages being diversity and longevity I think helps us in markets like this in situations like that in particular, so. Okay. Thank you, Toshiya.
We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thank you very much. I had a question on gross margin flow-through, fall-through and especially as it relates to utilization and inventory. So free cash flow 12 months trailing, which you always point us too correctly, which is kind of in the same ballpark that you had last quarter, but then inventory was down.
And the fall through the margins is much higher incrementally, and I know it's not the same every quarter, but I was just curious if there's something going on there. What are the puts and takes that caused the incremental fall through to be higher?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. And I'll take that. From the way you want to think about it is our fall through, as we have said before, is about 70% to 75%. And you want to look at that on a year-on-year basis. And even then, this is sometimes a little less, a little more but that's the right way to look at it, and this quarter is actually right between that 70% and 75%.
The other thing I would mention is over the longer-term period, over the last many years and we expect this to continue, you're seeing the benefit of 300-millimeter manufacturing. That is part of our competitive advantage, manufacturing technology.
And as we have talked about before, it's just a structural cost advantage because of the geometry of the wafer and the relatively small incremental cost that goes into producing the 300-millimeter wafer versus 200-millimeter wafer. So, we expect that benefit to continue to accrue to gross margins and ultimately free cash flow margin, which is the one that drives value for the owners of the company.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow-on Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes, I did and this is more blocking and tackling and I know you guys have correctly frame from calling a cycle because everybody's track record, including my owners absolutely wrong on that front, but bookings, cancellations and lead times, where are we on these metrics? Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I think if you look at those metrics overall, I'd say that inventory in the channel, and more broadly, I think you're looking at kind of the cyclical metrics that you looked at. Inventory and channel was down about a day. Still, it's about 4.5 weeks and has been steady at that for a couple of quarters now.
Order rates, when we look at those looked normal as they came through. Cancellations were down a little bit from last quarter, but really didn't change much. And then our lead times overall have remained stable.
Certainly, they were stable as things got more heated in the industry, but – and of course there's always areas that we would still be tight on today, but in general, the lead times have remained very stable, so.
Dave Pahl
Thank you, Ambrish. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just on Huawei. You answered sort of generally, but specifically, what do you have embedded in your guidance regarding Huawei? Are you still contemplating selling product to them? Or are you not? What's in the guidance regarding that customer?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, I’d say, Stacy, just over this past quarter, we obviously had halted shipments when the order was given. Since then, we've resumed shipments of the products that we've determined we could ship that are in compliance with the U.S. regulations. So overall, in this quarter, things came in as we expected. And as I stated before, that would be inclusive of communications equipment, where Huawei would sit. So, in our guidance, we obviously have that in for the quarter. And if there was something unusual that we are keeping out, our practice has been to call that out and there's nothing unusual that we're planning on. Do you have a follow-on?
Stacy Rasgon
Yes, I do. Thank you. Well, the stockpiling and consignment overall strategy that you've been doing, it's been going on for a while. How much do you think that has increased utilization over the last few quarters as you've been rolling that out? And how much longer do you anticipate driving that strategy before it reaches completion?
Rafael Lizardi
Let me start, and then, Dave, you want to – if you want to comment. But we've had an inventory strategy for many years. We just continue to tweak it over time, make it better, stronger. And as the cycle started in third quarter or so, then we deploy some specific tools during that time to then take advantage of that situation and use what we call our wafer starts. We devoted an increasing share of that to the low-volume inventory strategy. We have built a lot of that but it's not complete. But incrementally, it's going to be less going forward than what it was in the last few quarters because you get to obviously diminishing returns at some point in that.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And I'll point out, obviously, you saw our inventory dollars were down sequentially. They're actually down year-on-year. Our inventory days were down sequentially even with those planned builds of those low-volume parts, and we feel really good about being able to do that in our operations. The second part of your question there was what is the impact of consignment have on utilization. It really has no impact at all. Basically, it optically and, by definition, just puts more inventory on our books. But even if the inventory didn’t change in the channel, it just would put pressure and optically put pressure on our inventory, and that's going on as well.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I want to make one more comment on this topic. Remember what inventory is about, right? What is objective inventory? It's not about maximizing utilization or gross margins or anything like that. It’s about maintaining high levels of customer service. So, what we have done is deployed our cash to inventory. And as Dave said, inventory actually decreased. But we think that decrease, we built some inventory of low-volume parts. That now puts us in a great position as we move into the third quarter and beyond. You have that inventory of low volume that is generally difficult to build. We have it ready, so that we'll be able to serve our customers on the other side of this very well.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Stacy. And we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We will hear now from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
Hi, guys. May I ask a question? I want to stick on the consignment topic, but just a slightly different spin. I think you've said in the last call, last few calls that it's upwards of two-thirds of your revenues go through consignment. That's increased substantially over the last three, five, 10 years. Why do you think your year-over-year revenue performance is so similar to your broader peer group if you're controlling that inventory? I would think all else being equal, you wouldn't have to deal with the distribution channel burning inventory and weighing on your revenues during a period like this.
Rafael Lizardi
I'll give you one comment, and Dave, you may want to chime in. What I would tell you is, maybe take into account, in the last four quarters or so, five quarters, we have gone through the next phase of consignment and we have added, let's say, $30 million to $40 million of revenue to that program per quarter during that time, for a total of close to $200 million. We probably still have one more quarter to go where that is – where that's going to happen and maybe through the end of the year, but it's getting to the diminishing point. But that is revenue that from the P&L we had sort of disappeared, right, but obviously the demand hasn't changed.
That end demand really hasn't changed. It's just that now it goes into our inventory and the revenues delayed, but it just puts us in a much better position to then own that inventory, distribute it better where it's needed, work with our manufacturing facilities better to determine what's needed to be built for –to replenish that inventory. So, it's just a better way to operate.
Dave Pahl
Yes, and I'll just to add that when you think of one of our competitive advantage, which is the reach of our market channels, this is just one component of what we're doing to have a closer, more direct relationship with our customers. And we think that ultimately servicing them better with product will benefit them and therefore benefit us. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore
Yes, one that's a little bit more housekeeping, Dave. From an end market point of view, you went through and gave the year-over-years. So, could you give the quarter-over-quarters beyond the comms side? And was there a reason you put industrial and automotive together saying there were down upper single-digits year-over-year? Usually, you split those?
Dave Pahl
No. Yes. Sure. So, the first is they performed similarly. Industrial was a little weaker. Auto was a little less weak but in the same zip code, and that was the same for the sequential. Together, they grew low single-digits and that same profile was the same. Personal electronics grew high single-digits with broad-based seasonal growth. Comms equipment, as I mentioned earlier, had declined, and then enterprise systems actually grew sequentially. Okay, thank you, Ross.
And we’ll go the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We’ll now hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the most recent SIA data, April, May sales were down about 10% year-over-year for the global Analog segment, while you guys were only down 6%. You clearly outperformed the Analog segment last year as well. So outside of the end market mix, i.e., better comm equipment sector. Can you guys help us understand any product areas where you're either capturing market share or seeing strong dollar content growth?
Dave Pahl
Well, yes, so first, Harlan, I’d always be careful to read too much into any of those numbers in the short-term. I think when you look at the share gains, they just really need to be even over several year. And I think that's – even in that case, I think we come out very well. I think especially we continue to do well in industrial and automotive. As I mentioned earlier, that is, we believe that those will be the most important markets to semiconductors and industrial in particular. And we've got a lot of programs and a lot of thought going into how to get better and get stronger to be able to service those markets. Do you have a follow-on?
Harlan Sur
Yes. Thanks for the insights there. I know we have to be careful on how we interpret this number, but can you guys just tell us what the book-to-bill ratio is for the June quarter?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, you set me up perfect there, because I always have the preamble that I'll give it. I've debated honestly whether I should continue to give it, but I will. Just because we do, but there is a lot of noise that's in it. So, it was 0.94% and it was 1.06% a year-ago and 0.99% last quarter, so and I'll just remind everyone that we have the majority of the revenue on consignment. So, we don't get orders in advance for that. We've got backlog and the consignment the orders in the backlog are all consistent with the guidance that we gave. So, thank you Harlan. And I believe we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll hear now from Chris Danley with Citigroup.
Christopher Danely
Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you just talk about the linearity of orders during the quarter? And I guess more specifically, have you seen any change in customer or channel behavior since the Huawei reinstatement and the – I guess the threat of $300 billion in additional tariffs was taken away a few weeks ago?
Dave Pahl
Yes, Chris. Really no changes on that front, I think when we look at the linearity, it came in fairly normal, minus the stock shipment to Huawei. But once we determined that we could continue to resume most of those products. It really got back to normal pretty quickly. Do you have a follow-on?
Christopher Danely
Yes. Given, we're in this – I guess mildly depressed or sluggish or flaccid or whatever you want to call it kind of environment. Have you guys changed your thoughts on kind of long-term CapEx?
Rafael Lizardi
The short answer is, no. We are – as we said in our capital management strategy, our guide on CapEx is 6% and we'll continue to be 6% and that's without buildings. So of course, as we've talked about, we announced the new factory – the new 300 millimeter factory that we build in Richardson, Texas in the next few years. Outside of that, we'll be running about 6%.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Chris. And operator, I think we’ve got time for one more call.
Operator
Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me okay?
Dave Pahl
We can, Mark.
Mark Lipacis
Okay. Your inventories declined in dollars and days. What do you think happens to your inventories on your balance sheet in the September quarter? And Dave, on the inventory commentary, I believe you said you characterized channel inventory as kind of in a stable range. Would you call them stable in a normal and healthy level? Or would you characterize them somewhat differently?
Rafael Lizardi
Let me start, and Dave, if you want to jump in. But let me first step back to the objective for inventory to remind everybody and, as I said earlier in the call, is to maintain high levels of customer service. We also want to minimize obsolesces of that inventory and improve our asset utilization, but the main thing is to maintain high levels of customer service. And our target is 1.15 to 1.45. So last quarter – two quarters ago, we went above that target, 1.52. But then last quarter, we're at 1.44 in one – first quarter and then second quarter, we just finished at 1.43, so both of those inside of our target.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And I’ll just add again that even outside of those numbers, we’ve made really good progress of executing to building those low volume parts and we believe that's important, so we can continue to service customers well. In the second part of your question, Mark was, yes, it was down a little bit sequentially on the day’s basis in distribution, still at about 4.5 weeks. That is a healthy level.
And I would say that, that number will structurally kind of work its way down as we're implementing more of this revenue on consignment, and that's a great thing for our distributors. It's a great thing for our customers and it does require that we’ll be carrying some more inventory on our balance sheet, but we think that, that's a good investment in working capital. Do you have a follow-on, Mark?
Mark Lipacis
Yes, please. Thank you. The follow-up is, have you been noticing since the U.S. and China trade debate. Have you been noticing any shift in the supply chain from a standpoint of where things are being manufactured not your own Texas Instruments supply chain, but where you're shipping to – are you shipping more outside of China or is everything fairly stable? Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, I'll take that. It's too early to tell. We read some of the same media reports and anecdotal comments that people make on that front, but it's too early to tell. So, we'll watch how things evolve in that front over the next few years.
So, I want to finish with a few comments on key items for everybody to remember. We will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products; and industrial and automotive, the best markets. We will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy, and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company.
And finally, we continue to believe growing free cash flow per share dollars over the long-term is what will maximize value for the owners of the company.

Tore Svanberg
Good morning, everyone. Welcome to day three of the Stifel 2019 Cross Sector Insight Conference. My name is Tore Svanberg. I'm a senior semiconductor analyst and I cover analog and IoT semiconductors. It's my pleasure to introduce this next session, Texas Instruments. I'm sure you're all familiar with the company. With us from the company, we have Rafael Lizardi who is the company's Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer; and then also Dave Pahl, who is Director of Investor Relations. The particular format for this session is going to be a fireside chat or Q&A. I would like for this session to be as interactive as possible. So if you do have questions, always feel free to raise your hand and then we will try and get to you. So with that, and before I sit down, Rafael what we typically do with these types of sessions is, just give a two to three minute introduction to the company, just for those that may not know the company that well. Thank you. 
Rafael Lizardi
Sure. Thank you. Yes, so quick introduction, Texas Instruments, we are focused on what we think are the best markets in the semiconductor space, that’s automotive and industrial. It's about 56% of our revenues and that number has been growing tremendous. I think it was -- four, five years ago it was 40% or so. So that's where we're focusing our R&D and that's because that's where the content is growing, right? And you see it every day in cars on the automotive space. But on the industrial space that’s also happening in factories, medical, grid, et cetera. And then from a product standpoint, we're focused on analog and embedded which we think are the best spaces in the semiconductor space that have a long history of generating great cash flow. 
We have competitive advantages that I'll be happy to go into detail, but we think put us in a really good position to hold and in fact extend our lead. And then we generated a lot of free cash flow. Last year it was $6 billion. And we have grown over the last 14 years or so at a pretty nice CAGR. And then our focus from a capital management standpoint is to then return that cash, all of it to the owners of the company, and that's what we've been doing for the last decade and a half. And then we do that through dividends and buybacks.

2019-06-12,Q&A," Session
Q - Tore Svanberg
Thank you, Rafael. So I want to focus mainly on fundamental and long-term things but before we go there, just …
Rafael Lizardi
We have to cover the short-term. 
Tore Svanberg
We got to, yes -- just for a few questions there. And obviously the big elephant in the room is China and Huawei. So how is TI managing through this turbulent macro climate that we're in, especially when it comes to China and a customer like Huawei? 
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So maybe let me address the environment first including China. So we -- starting in October or so we talked about that in our earnings calls and different sessions that we were entering into what we characterize as a semiconductor downturn, meaning worldwide GDP was not changing, at least not changing much. And what really was driving the industry trends down was your normal semiconductor cycle, so draining off of customers’ inventory. 
Historically, those lasted about a year, four, five, six quarters. And that's because you have two years of running above trend. You got to have a year or so running below trend and that's just how the industry has worked and will continue to work. And then we took necessary steps to manage through that. And in the long-term frankly it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, this -- end markets are going to grow, the content is going to grow and we're well positioned for that. But in the short-term, we do take some steps and we've been taking those steps in terms of inventory and different things. 
I don't think the dynamic at the highest level is not that different in China. Of course, you have the trade tensions and different things. I think the concern there, of course, is that the trade escalation could lead to a macro event, and then we're not talking about just the semiconductor downturn, and we could be talking about an economic recession. And that would have bigger implications. And of course, that's not something we control, we just -- we're in a good position to handle whatever the economy throws at us just given our strategic position and our operational stand on that. 
Tore Svanberg
Very good. Thank you for calling that near-term. Moving to more long-term things and I'll start sort of more high-end and then we'll bring it down to some of the segments. So I did an analysis, I looked at the last up-cycle that lasted from 2012 to 2018, you guys did a phenomenal job on returns analysis, especially return on capital, your free cash flow per share growth was also pretty solid during that period. 
Now that we are in “a downturn” what are you doing to try and get similar returns for the next six years? I mean I think back then you were coming off of National acquisition, you'd bought a lot of equipment for $0.10, $0.20 and $1. What are you doing or planning now to just to try and have a similar performance for the next six years, or whenever the upturn happens? 
Rafael Lizardi 
Yes, yes. No, well, several things and it comes under some of the things I mentioned earlier but the first one is continuing to invest where the growth is going to be, which is industrial automotive. And think about world that stops growing and that would be bad but think for a second of that scenario. Are we going to have more EVs as a proportion of cars than before? I think so, I think it’s likely, it's not for sure, but it's likely. On the industrial front, are we going to have more automation in factories? Are we going to have more automation in the grid or more electric content to manage the EV charges in the grid? Are we going to have more semiconductor accompanying medical? Yes. Right? 
So even if we have periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or even a contraction, we still see a tremendous opportunity in industrial automotive. So we're going to continue investing in that. So that's one thing we're doing. The other thing we're working on is expanding our competitive advantages, which one is that we have the broadest portfolio and that my R&D comment applies to that as we continue to expand in there. But the other one is manufacturing and technology. We have the -- we're the only analog player with its own 300 millimeter factory for integrated circuits of analog. And now we have recently announced that we're going to expand that and build a second standalone factory also in Texas, 300 millimeter. So we're continuing to expand our region. And why is that important? 300 millimeter at the chip level is 40% less expensive than 200 millimeter. That gives you just a huge advantage to deploy in those ways.
Tore Svanberg
Very good. And moving on to some of the end markets and you talked about obviously EV and factory automation. So let's start with automotive, clearly a very attractive market for analog and embedded from that perspective. But the one problem with that is that everybody knows it, so everybody is investing in it. And obviously analog is always going to be somewhat fragmented, but it does seem like some of your digital peers are starting to invest more dollars in automotive. So how should we think about that dynamic over the next five to seven years, as more and more companies start pouring capital onto the automotive market, which by the way, historically was more sort of the analog and microcontroller guys, right? I mean, you didn't see a lot NVIDIAs and the Intels and the Qualcomms getting into that market. So how could that change the dynamic? 
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, I'll give you some comments. And Dave if you want to add. Well, first, we don't compete against some of those [internally]. So even if a lot of those are getting into -- doesn't matter to us, right? Our spectrum of competitors -- it’s a very fragmented industry but it has consolidated over the years. So even the more trying to get in, we still got generally a smaller pool. But at the end of the day what -- the most important thing comes down to our competitive advantage. Those are the same things that gives a leg up in competing in all markets, but auto is the same. So I mentioned 300 millimeter, well, that gives us a pretty big advantage. We are going to have the lowest cost player in an industry where price is not the number one, number two, number three, maybe number five care about, but it still puts you in a good position to compete, and then generate more free cash flow. Having the broadest portfolio, that's also very important, for any customer you want to deal with fewer suppliers. And also more important than that, when you engage with a customer then and you deploy the R&D resources for a product and you deploy the sales resources and engage with a customer, you're not just selling one or two products, you can sell 20 or 30 different products. So the dynamic and the scalability becomes very different for that and it's advantageous for you to compete.
Dave Pahl
Yes, and I’d add, I think the automotive market and any market when you look at it, we always look at it through the lens of risk of commoditization. And of course, there will be parts of that market just like our markets that commoditize. But the general structure of it lends itself to that, meaning if you look at only 85 million units a year, that might sound like a lot, but compared to the cellphone market, it’s 1.7 billion. It's significantly smaller from a scale. And then if you look at the top one or two manufacturers, there are around 15 million units each, and then each of those have five, six, seven platforms that go into it. So there's a lot of fragmentation in the market itself. And if you look at where our growth has come from, it’s come from very diverse areas. We've got five sectors that are contributing to growth in automotive, four of them significant. And our investments continue to go across those five sectors. We service close to 1,000 OEMs and of course that'll be a combination of Tier 1, 2s and 3s. You could imagine the revenue will be skewed to the Tier 1s. That any given Tier 1 will ship a couple of thousand different skews into. So very different again. And if you look at like a cellphone, there's a couple of key components that go into it and everybody beats the crap out of each other to get those few components. 
Now, are there areas that can commoditize? I will offer a tire pressure sensors 4 point something per car times 85 million, now you're talking hundreds of million and there's not much differentiation between the low end and the high end. It all does the same thing. So, will there be areas should that commoditize? Of course. That will steer investments away from those areas. 
Tore Svanberg
Good. And moving on to the industrial market where there's obviously a lot of electronic content growth happening and I think it's very -- it's hard for us investors to see it right because we don't see the little industrial customers that are doing special things. But I would think that this is clearly an example where skill matters, right? Because you guys have more than 100,000 customers, you have probably the biggest FAE force out there in the analog space period. So is this really going to be the true competitive advantage for you in the industrial space? And I guess even from educating those customers to use electronics, how you’re going about doing that? 
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, so it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. You're talking -- there are big players there too, but for the most part, it’s about the medium to small sized players. And then matters from scalability have failed, so as I mentioned earlier, right. If you're going to call into a customer, you only have one part to sell, that's just not going to work. The math doesn't work. You need to have 20 different parts that you can sell. If you're going to do your R&D and release a part, you can’t just sell it to one customer, the math doesn't work, the volumes are not high enough. You got to sell it to 20 different industrial customers, right? So yes, those are the -- there was a second part to your question that I…
Tore Svanberg
Well, how do you educate industrial customers to use more electronic? 
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, well, right. The other angle that we're taking on that for this is reference designs, and we've been in reference designs for decades, so that's not new. But what is newer is that over the last four or five years, we’ve formed teams that are dedicated to this market. So there's one team that’s dedicated to industrial, one that’s dedicated to automotive, and these things are across the world. And they focus on -- and it's not just a generic reference design, it is -- we're trying to get very granular as to not just reference design for a washing machine, but for the power board of this portion of the washing machine that does X, Y, and Z in a particular way. So you got to get pretty good at doing that. And then that is important for small customers because they don't have the engineering staff. They have two or three engineers, there will be other very good engineers, but they don't know everything there is to know about power, signal, chain and the sub-element and these other things. So the more -- and we have the scale to know enough about that. We're not going to do what they do, right? We just take them up to a certain point and they add differentiation in their own products. But it helps to take a third of the way or whatever it is in that process. And most importantly for us, it makes -- it incentivizes and puts in a position to be selling more and more of those parts on that board, instead of 10 parts, we can design in 20 or 30 different parts on that board.
Tore Svanberg
Got it. Very good. And then moving on to third market, which is communication. I think you've talked about that being less of a strategic market for you. But from time-to-time opportunistically you participate, obviously 5G is kind of that time right now. But the one thing that I've always asked myself is when it comes to TI, why hasn’t the company participated more in RF, right? And obviously now we think about 5G, RF becomes a really, really important part of the market. Is it just simply because it's such a volatile market that the return on investment is not there or any other reason? 
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think if you look at RF, and just the sheer dollars of it, there's a large portion that’s steered towards personal electronics, cellphones in particular, and there's not a lot of differentiation and that's a very tough place to live. That said, there's other parts of the market that use RF, but think of in aerospace or other forms of it that I bet you can’t find differentiation. I think it’s just -- a good example is when we look at our portfolio overall, we've got every significant area covered, but there's always niches where we won’t participate. And so that's a good thing, I think just this is kind of the structure of the market. If you look at 5G, now we’re not in power amplifiers but we've got other RF products, converters, filters, amplifiers and things like that that fit in that RF chain. So it's not like we're absent, but not in the power amplifiers. 
Tore Svanberg
And I know you had pretty strong growth over the last 12 months in that market. I assume there’s still growth there, pretty long tail to the next few years. How should we think about TI’s participation in 5G for the next few years?
Rafael Lizardi 
Let me -- maybe one comment on comms equipment, which is what we define as we call that market, last year was 11% of our revenue. Auto and industrial combined were 56% of our revenue, even personal electronics was bigger at 25%. So it’s a relatively small part of our revenue. Almost all of it is analog. And certainly on a go forward basis, the R&D that we are putting into that space is analog. Because we think that if there's going to be any growth there it’s going to be in analog. And the reason for it is the AT&Ts of the world, their CapEx is going to be flat for years to come, because people in this room are not willing to pay more for -- everybody looks up when I say that, you’re not willing to pay more for your services, okay? People don't want to pay more, so then AT&T is going to spend more, and if they're not going to spend more that means the suppliers are not going to get more. So there's the pie that's not growing, it's going to shift a little bit and we think more analog will be spent and less digital. But is still going to be pretty constrained, right? So that's why we are limiting the opportunity. 
Whereas contrast that with automotive, right? Automotive going EV, I mean some people are asking for that but a lot of that is government saying that they have to go EV, so then there's no choice. The spend in there will go up on industrial, industrial pays for itself. When you automate a factory, you make it cheaper, you make it more efficient, right? When you make things safe or better in industrial space, that also pays for itself, so we see -- that's where we see the content growing. That's a distinction between those two end markets and the comms equipment market. 
Tore Svanberg
Thank you for that perspective, that’s great. Back to some more structural things. And there's a lot of thinking right now that with the trade war with China, that China is going to hunker down and really now developing own semiconductors and there's even been some suggestions that they started more in memory and processors and that’s not panning out, so you now could actually go and build an analog business. I'm just telling you what's been said out there. What's your view on China building its own analog business? I haven't seen it as an analyst for the last 21 years. But I would like love to hear your perspective? 
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, no, our sense is the China Inc, they want to lessen their dependence on The United States. I think that’s -- I think everybody in that position will do the same. For the same competitive advantages that help us against our traditional competitors are the same ones that have and will continue to help us against any effort to -- in China to go after the analog space and that's why China over the last year what they focused on are the easier and frankly the more rational areas to attack first, which are memory, digital, because you can make a very specific targeted investment, get a few parts on a very specific process technology. And within a few years, you can have revenue, mildly profitable revenue, but you get some revenue and then you reinvest and then you keep going at that, right? You don't need the huge sales channel, because you're selling also to a relatively smaller customer base and relatively smaller products. 
Now to go to analog, as we were talking earlier, you need at least several thousand different parts just to get started, right, for the dynamics that we talked about earlier. And really to be able to go against us where we have 100,000 different parts ourselves is pretty daunting even if you had a few thousand parts. You don't just need one technology to go out, you need dozens of process technologies and then you need thousands of different products that each of those has their own idiosyncrasies and IPs and different things. So it's not a take IP from wherever and go deploy it, you got to build a whole library of different things. And even then -- even if somebody had all that, it would be very difficult to deploy, right? So we think we have some inherent advantages in that. That doesn't mean they're impregnable. If somebody really wants to go at it, they could make a dent at that, but that would take decades. And our job is just to not stand still, which we’re not, we always continue to strengthen our advantage.
Tore Svanberg
Okay, good point. The other topic is sort of analog market share. And you guys obviously have grown organically, and you've also made some acquisitions. And I think now you're approximately at 80%, 90% share of the analog market. But during the last up-cycle, you didn't make any acquisitions, whereas a lot of other companies around you have been consolidating and buying companies. So why is that? I mean, is it simply because evaluation didn't make sense or is it just quite simple you didn't find any attractive asset that you wanted to go after? 
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So let me first step back and remind everybody of our criteria for acquisition right? First, it has to be strategic fit. So us, that means analog companies only, we don't look at anything but analog focused on industrial and automotive, catalog products but not custom products but catalog products for so many reasons I talked about earlier and differentiated products. That’s a tough criteria not many companies would fall -- would need all those. And then the price has to be right. And that means that we can hit our WAC within three or four years. So for example, and this is on free cash flow basis, this is not earning accretion, this is free cash flow basis. So if my WAC is 10% for argument sake, I buy something for $100 within three or four years that would be giving me 10 bucks. And from there, I keep on growing there. That's also tough criteria to meet. Now let me take an even broader step back. We're not missing anything on our portfolio, frankly. So that's the other thing. It's not like I'm looking for something to that will complete my portfolio, we're not. Arguably, with the National acquisition, we were missing some pieces related to industrial in particular and that helped fill that and at the moment we're good, we’re developing hundreds of products every year, more process technologies to continue to staying ahead of the competition. 
Tore Svanberg
And on that financial metrics and M&A and I'm not suggesting or asking for you to change it. But I just want to hear your perspective because obviously evaluation in the semiconductor space has continued to go up every year, right? If you look at the last 20 years it’s continued to creep up and I know if that's a function of consolidation that is a function of more markets now, who knows but the reality is that the evaluation has kept going up. So do you then adjust your view on evaluation or you will continue to maintain like three or four years, that’s it?
Rafael Lizardi
You never say never in those things and evaluation is such a subjective art form which I think everybody in this room appreciate that. I think the one carry I would give you, profitability has improved in the industry. So when you say evaluation I am not sure we are talking absolute evaluation or relative evaluation but profitability has improved, clearly tax reform helped us, not every company but many companies were I think ….
So yes, we got to take that into account. But we’ve been pretty firm with our criteria and I think that's probably going to stay. 
Tore Svanberg
Okay. Very good. So we have a few more minutes. Any questions?
Unidentified Analyst
[Question Inaudible].
Tore Svanberg
Yes, could you repeat the question?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, okay. Yes, so how quick we could adjust to tariffs? The tariffs that have been placed so far have had virtually zero impact to us directly, direct impact. Because China has not put tariffs on semiconductors and the US did but 90% of what we ship is outside of the United States. And even what we ship into United States is very little of that is from China. So we haven't had any direct impact. And we don't expect any. You can never rule that out because in a trade war things can -- people can do irrational things but it would really -- it wouldn't make sense for China to put tariffs on semiconductors, because they need that for their own production and export industrial. 
Unidentified Analyst
[Question Inaudible]. 
Rafael Lizardi
I am really sorry I left that but embedded is more cyclical?
Unidentified Analyst
[Question Inaudible]. 
Rafael Lizardi
Well. I'll give you my perspective, Dave if you want jump in. I don't know if I would call it most cyclical. The cyclicality seems to be a little out of phase with analog by a few quarters, and no one sits in a while. We looked at it internally, I'm not quite sure why there's some theories, it's higher EPs, the decisions are made sooner. But I wouldn't characterize it necessarily as more cyclical. 
On the return, I get this question in different ways and I think this is where you're going but analog is more profitable than embedded, okay? And if you look around the industry, analog companies are more profitable than embedded companies, right? But our embedded business, what was it last 31%, something like that profit from operations. That's pretty good. Okay, they're generating good free cash flow. So they don't have to be as good as analog, they just have to be a part of contributor to free cash flow. Dave?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I’d just add, when you look at this particular cycle as we're working our way through it, there are some fundamental differences and the strength that we've seen in comms equipment is driven by 5G. That's analog content, that's increasing. So it's benefiting from that, some of the differences between the two would be a lot less with or without that, but there still be some differences but that’s fine.
Rafael Lizardi
But -- for the current cycle, it’s right, 5G has helped analog a little bit.
Tore Svanberg
One last question, quick one, because we're running out of time.
Unidentified Analyst 
[Question Inaudible].
Rafael Lizardi
So I'll speak for TI, of course. We see in the analog space, not in embedded, in the analog space there’s value in owning our own manufacturing, particularly 300 millimeter. As I mentioned earlier, we got a huge cost advantage 40%. If we were to outsource that, CSMC would get that 40% advantage. And they would monetize that which they do. So some of our competitors will tell you that they do use 300 with CSMC and other factories like that. But they're not getting the benefit of it, okay? And then on top of that, you can have the argument of owning the technology, right? I think that’s also important, but primary reason is the 40% cost advantage. 
Tore Svanberg
Very good. We're running out of time. I want to thank Rafael and Dave for coming to our Stifel Conference and thank you to all you for coming to the TI session and enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
Thank you.

Welcome back. Hope everyone had a nice lunch. I’m Vivek Arya. I cover Semiconductors and Semicon Equipment at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Glad you could join us, and delighted to have Dave Pahl, Vice President of Investor Relations for Texas Instruments join us. What we’d do is maybe start with some high-level questions about the industry. Then go into some TI specific questions, but please feel free to raise your hands if you have a burning question in between, but welcome Dave. Very happy to have you here.
Dave Pahl
Thanks for having us.
"
2019-06-04,Q&A," Session
Q - Vivek Arya
So maybe Dave as a start, give us your sense of kind of the state of the union, where we are now versus what you thought at the start of the year?
Dave Pahl
Well, maybe I’ll start even higher level that those who are not familiar TI, that, I think we’re a company in semiconductor industry focused on the best products and we think that's analog and embedded and then the best markets inside of that which is industrial and automotive.
Those are the areas that we've been allocating our capital too. There’s lots of natural competitive moats around the Analog and Embedded markets and we think they’re great markets. I think to the question more of the near term, I think as we ran up to the end of the year and up to third quarter we had what was a ten quarters of year-on-year growth. Most of that was double-digit as you know. And all of us in the industry we don’t if that’s going to be ten quarters or 12 quarters or 16 quarters, if you see that growth, but you know at some point it's going to weaken and rollover.
We saw signs of that start in the third quarter. That continued in to fourth -- in the first and obviously our second quarter guidance suggest that will continue. So, we stay out of the game of calling the bottom or predicting how long the cycle will last. And we pay attention to it and operate inside of that. But our thesis on the products and the markets we’re investing in kind of on a three and five-year horizon remain unchanged and we’re keeping our nose down and grinding away.
Vivek Arya
I see. Got it. And you know what's been common to most downturns and it sounds kind of obvious is inventory cycles, right? That the secular aspect of the industry has been there for many years, but what kind of has been driving these cycles that’s really inventory. Do you think that this time around there is anything different about the cycle where inventory more elevated versus what you had seen in prior guidance, whether its on your own balance sheet. Whether it’s at the customer? Like is there anything that you think is different about this that can help us get some clues as to when we might be able to come out of it?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think and we've talked about this before if you look over the last 30 years. We’ve had nine up cycles and we’re working our way through the ninth down cycle, and some of those are pretty short so you want to dismiss them. And some are unusual for other ways and you want to dismiss those. So now you’re down to handful of cycles to judge which you and I have had enough math both.
Vivek Arya
Right.
Dave Pahl
We know there's not much you can draw statistically from single digit data points, right? So, I'm just careful in trying to predict to any of that. But I think that cycles are driven by human behavior and that's not changed for centuries. So, that’s when operating teams get on Monday morning, they get a note from some other suppliers that lead times are going out. They put in a couple weeks of inventory to protect themselves and that might extend for a couple of quarters and at some point their CFOs going to have to come to the BofA conference and face investors and he’s like, hey, who let this, please get that many weeks of inventory and it goes back down the other direction. And I think that's just the basics of what drives the inventory cycles.
Vivek Arya
Got it. So, if you were to kind of contrast your visibility about. There’s a lot of enthusiasm about the second half. I know, TI doesn't give longer term outlook, but there’s a lot of expectation, enthusiasm, I guess hope that there’s going to be a second half rebound. If you sort of look at your visibility around the second half contrast with prior years, is there anything different or similar?
Dave Pahl
Well, there are some things that are different and if I go back and look at it we got four competitive advantages at the company and you’ve heard us talk about them before of manufacturing and technology, the reach of our market channels, our broad product portfolio and long-lived and diverse positions. And you look at the one of the reach of our market channels, so at any time we’ve got a dozen initiatives that’s going to strengthen those four competitive advantages. And the outcome of one of them that strengthening that reach of channel was the belief that we wanted to have a closer more direct relationship with our customers because we think those that control that interface over time are the ones that'll win economically.
And how that came out of that was our consignment program. So you’ve heard us talk about those things before. And we believe there's strategic value in owning and controlling that inventory that's out in the channel and sitting on our books. So in those arrangements we don't get any advanced order. We don’t carry a backlog. But our customers invest in tying their planning systems into ours. So we can see usually on a daily basis out six months of what they’re planning to build. There's no inventory there. So we get as best visibility as you can get on what they're planning to build. Now our visibility ends at that manufacturing line. We don't see their WIP. We don't see their finished goods. We don’t see down into their channels and always caution don’t confuse visibility with stability because that can change pretty quickly. But yes, so we -- that’s two-thirds of our revenue today. It’s really different than what it was a decade ago.
Vivek Arya
So, as you know you look at in that crystal ball, do you think hopes and enthusiasm about a second half rebound are justified?
Dave Pahl
We’ve tried as hard as we can not to weigh into that debate. We have plenty of peers that provide that entertainment and we’ll just listen to it.
Vivek Arya
So other than being on Twitter 24 hours a day, what else can TI do to plan your business properly? What are you doing differently given this level of uncertainty?
Dave Pahl
Well, I think a couple of things. One, I made the comment with cycles, those are surprises. You just don't know when they’re going to show up. You don't know how long the last you operated them. I mentioned before that our investments haven't changed and our view on the opportunity in automotive and industrial remains unchanged. So the investments there remain unchanged. I think we've got some things going on in China that you have to pay attention to. And in fact, Rich, our CEO had a planned trip to China just two weeks ago.
So, I can't remember when the announcement came out for the stop ship on Huawei. It’s Thursday or Friday, he showed up there the following Monday and just perfect timing, because you can imagine the teams there anxious with all the changes going on and Rich advice to the team was very simple and direct. He’s like you know is your job going to be harder with trade tensions. It's going to be. But when you have a rising power, challenging an established power whether you have a resolution in the short term, are you still to have trade tensions for decades to come, you likely are, so just accept it. And there’s going to be two kind of companies that come out of this, those that figure out how to do well and prosper in that kind of environment and those that can't figure out and we’re going to work really hard to make sure we figure it out. So, I think that that's just the attitude of getting beyond the emotion, the denial, the fear, all of the stuff that comes with that and just get on with things and figure out a way through it.
Vivek Arya
I want to get into China, but just before that from just a clarification perspective, how important is Huawei as a customer for TI?
Dave Pahl
So, last year there were 3%, 4% of our revenue overall, you can imagine with comms equipment space growing as aggressively as it has and the other markets getting weaker, it was a higher percentage than that. So not insignificant, but certainly doesn’t change economics of the company. And I think that's where you come down to that fourth competitive advantage of diversity and longevity. We’re not dependent on any given customer or technology or product at one of our customers for a revenue.
Vivek Arya
And the exposure that is all on the infrastructure side or is it on the phone side?
Dave Pahl
It's a mix of both and they make actually a few other things that we’re in, but those two are the largest and obviously be skewed to the communications equipment side.
Vivek Arya
Okay. So, in China I wanted to discuss and there are aspects to it, right? One is China as part of your cost-base, right, and in terms of whether there is any impact of tariffs. Then there is China as a customer, right. Overall as you’ve heard is just you know if you ever see competition, are there substitutes for what you do from a China perspective. So on the cost side what is the impact of all the tariffs? So do you think that you have managed to kind of offset a lot of those impacts of it?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So the direct impact is real easy to measure and it's a number very close to zero. The way that the law was written in our industry, country of origin is defined pretty much by assembly test. And so it's got to be assembled and tested and we do have assembly test operations in China and then its got to be shipped into the U.S. So, we have a half a dozen assembly test sites, most in Asia, one in Mexico that we can move things around. And the day it was announced that was well less than 1% and we mitigated even that very small percentage. The secondary impacts to customers and things like that just is very difficult to measure, but in general do we think tariffs are bad thing and do they ultimately destroy demand, economic theory says it does. So that’s not something that we’re big fans of obviously.
Vivek Arya
I see. From an assembly and test perspective, hypothetically can you completely move out of China?
Dave Pahl
Well, I think we could, given enough time and energy…
Vivek Arya
Like requalification and those things, will they stand in the way?
Dave Pahl
We could, but I don’t think we’d want to, right. China continues to be an important market. There is more opportunity than threat or problems there. So, as I said earlier we’re going to figure out how to be successful there.
Vivek Arya
Got it. And now from a customer perspective, when we just look at the K from last year, it had China as a 44% customer. I know that's the ship to kind of destination. Give us a sense for what is actually demand from indigenous China and how much is actually just shipped there, but then is exported overseas?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, and you’ve got stuff going in both directions, right. So as you said 44% is what we ship into China that's just the address, but like a large cell phone manufacturer or 100% of what we shipped to them goes to China and obviously that goes to places around the world. And we could ship something into European Tier 1 automaker that gets shipped into a BMW and put on a ship and sold into Beijing, right. So, you got stuff going in both directions. And given our breadth, number, we’ve got 100,000 customers. Our belief is end consumption is probably reflective of what GDP is a percentage of revenue, so, high teens pushing 20% or so of revenue probably ends up staying there.
Vivek Arya
Got it. You’re not over indexed in anyway, right, versus whatever the GDP contribution?
Dave Pahl
Correct.
Vivek Arya
And last one, I think the assumption is that when we look at China's the internal motivations to kind of be more self-sufficient in semiconductors.
Dave Pahl
Yes.
Vivek Arya
Usually people talk about memory or foundry or more digital and logic. We don't hear about China investment for example in analog. Is that the reality also, and that do you see China being less of a competitor, like, is it harder for them? What is so hard about analog [Indiscernible]?
Dave Pahl
Well, I think when nations or regions are looking at and you just look at history of how Europe entered the semiconductor market and then Japan entered and then Korea entered the pattern was the same, right. They all picked memory. And why do you pick that? I think number one it's a big part of the overall market. There's only a few part numbers that run at any one time. There's 10 customers that make up a large portion of that demand. You figure out how much market share you want to have and how many wafer fabs there is and you put that in place and go knock on the door of those 10 customers and you've got an entry into the business. So, when you look at our business we're the largest player in analog and last year we were about $10 billion, right. So and if you found the largest customer and the largest device at it you're looking at millions of dollars, right. So trying to figure all that stuff out is just a harder thing and not typically where governments go to dump their money.
Vivek Arya
If they had the money and the inclination what is so hard about analog? Why does analog command such good margins?
Dave Pahl
Well, I think there's lot of reasons and those reasons range from -- the products are unique. Many of them can be substituted. But once they're chosen, they're proprietary. And the average selling cost is $0.35. So the switching cost is much higher than any savings that you'd get near term. Those are built on proprietary process technologies at companies by very highly specialized and hard to find design engineers and unique design development tool flows that are tied to those process technologies.
Again, the diversity is a challenge. The support networks, everything you need to be able to get to market is a challenge. It's not showing up at 10 companies and asking how many units they want, right? So, I could go on longer, but those are the types of things that just make it difficult to enter and/or to actually gain share even with incumbents.
Vivek Arya
Got it. Is it a similar situation in microcontrollers, because that seems to be a lot more competitive market; there are suppliers in Asia as well you know in Europe as well.
Dave Pahl
Sure.
Vivek Arya
Microcontroller seems to be a lot more competitive market?
Dave Pahl
Just like an analog you can find pockets of it that are more competitive, those higher volume runners. And if you're entering into microcontrollers and you're chasing high volume opportunities and you're using an ARM processor and building at TSMC and using a OSAT to do your assembly test and there's no differentiation in the peripherals that you've got, you're using third-party design tool chains. That's a pretty ugly place to live, right. There's probably 20 companies that do things like that. But if you just like an analog have, the way you make money and embed it as you have as few of architectures, instruction set architectures as you can, you get as many customers and as much revenue on it, you offer differentiated products. So, the core or the instruction set really becomes like the engine in a car. Does it need to have one? Yes. Is that the reason why one buys a car? No. But it's everything else that sits around it that becomes the differentiation. And you find those things and find their way into all kinds of different devices.
Again, a microcontroller, the average selling price might be somewhere between $0.50 and $0.75. And you got the added software infrastructure that's over it that makes it harder to switch. Can they switch? Sure. But are they going to switch for $0.10 or a nickel. It's just too much work to do. So, you got to be very selective.
Vivek Arya
Got it. So, automotive and industrial are little more than half of your business right now?
Dave Pahl
Yes.
Vivek Arya
Why pick just these areas? So, if for example you know long term semiconductor as a GDP plus growth industry, what gives you the confidence that being an automotive and industrial will help you outgrow the industry?
Dave Pahl
It's a simple thesis that three, five, 10, even 20 years that there will be more content and those end markets than what there is today. I think you look at other markets like personal electronics and if you had tablets and PCs and handsets and everything else that we make as an industry about 2.5 billion of those things produced last year, 7.5 billion people on the planet. There’s a three-year replacement cycle stretch into four. That number just isn't going to double in five and 10 years. Same thing in comms equipment, and the enterprise markets only a couple of percent, so it's not meaningful force overall.
Vivek Arya
Got it. And what's also being very unique to TI has been the share gains that you have had just consistently in these industrial and automotive markets. You know 30, 40 basis points doesn't sound like a lot, but when you start compounding it, right, it does start… 
Dave Pahl
Decade, it makes a big difference.
Vivek Arya
It shows up.
Dave Pahl
Yes.
Vivek Arya
So what has helped TI get this market share on a consistent basis? Does it have to do with your 300 millimeter strategy or what are the key underlying drivers that has help you stay on this consistent share gain?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think what I would point to the four competitive advantages as the reason why that we've been able to do it. Manufacturing and technology is one. We talk about 300 millimeter, the most obvious example of that advantage, but there's other advantages and technologies and making the products differentiated. But the other two that are obvious is the product – the breadth of the product portfolio. We just attract more customers. And when we engage with more customers we got more products to be able to sell. And then the reach of our channels, tidot.com just gets more traffic because of the breadth of the portfolio. And those two things work together.
And then the fourth one is somewhat less understood because the diversity means we're not dependent on any model year of launch of a phone or any of one of our customer’s products. Now we'll benefit from that, but we're not dependent on it or think of the 5G cycle. We're still shipping 3G product, right. So, we'll benefit when 5G shows up but we're not counting on it or write it down on a on a date of hey, we have to have that happen to be able to gain share. So we can gain, continue to gain share even as these different cycles elongate or contract, we can we can benefit. So, really is the combination of those four things.
Vivek Arya
Got it. Now, one thing I'm curious about is, so you sell power management products, Maxim, Linear Tech, right, you have you have other competitors. How does a customer choose which of the power management product? Like do they buy more from TI because you might have 20 SKUs? You have just a broader range. Is it easier to order from ti.com? Like what turns a customer towards the TI product versus, because from the outside it looks like there are many companies that do power management. How does a customer go and make that decision?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think in analog and we're both engineers so engineers are pragmatic and if it's easier to choose something they'll choose it. But in any analog product there could be 100 or 200 different specs that define that, and there may be a handful half a dozen maybe a dozen that really matter. And there are some applications where we'll have the right product that just fits very naturally and we'll have a slight advantage. There may be others and you listed a couple of our peers good companies, they've got great products too and there will be some where they've got the advantage on those few specs.
Now, an engineer can -- if they're approaching the problem differently or designing something else those may be minimized and they could open up the window of what they could choose from. But again these are [$0.35] on average decisions, right. So there's not a committee of people sitting around making the decision that really is that engineer. So once you have an engagement with them typically through the web, we want to make that as easy as possible for that engineer to design in the product that they're looking for but also get other products in front of them that are going to naturally work with that. So now I'm sure our peers are trying to do the same thing. So that's not unique. But doing that, doing it well, doing it consistently having the right products, suggesting the right product at the right time is all part of what makes that engine go.
Vivek Arya
Got it. TI made the decision a few years ago to not use distribution right for demand creation. I think you still use them for demand fulfillment?
Dave Pahl
Sure.
Vivek Arya
In retrospect has that been a good strategy or do you think it has kind of reduce some of the leverage that you might have had otherwise in terms of getting your products to a bigger customer base?
Dave Pahl
Yes. There are few things in life that are so clear that this was a no-brainer. So, we've talked about how we've invested in demand creation and with that engagement of customers we could see the distributors just didn’t play a role in that. So, we stopped paying for a service that we weren't getting. I know there's -- we've got many of our peers that are maybe doubling, even doubling down on their investments there and that may work for them and may be appropriate. But we're probably like you said probably six, seven years into that journey and we have continued to execute and probably have better visibility and better granularity of what we need to do to engage with customers today than what we had back then.
Vivek Arya
Do you think you have more traction with ti.com than your competitors do with their portals?
Dave Pahl
Well, we've been investing in it for quite some time and I think we could give our website to any of our competitors and put their products on it and the processes that we use. And because of the breadth of our product portfolio they're not going to get the traffic across it. They're not going to get the ability and the amount of repetitions if you will, from the analytics engine getting smarter because of that that traffic. So, is it an advantage? Yes. But it's probably not the durable advantage that's out there really is the traffic and the breadth of the portfolio kind of working together that makes the difference.
Vivek Arya
Got it. One other thing that has made TI somewhat unique in the industry has been the early adoption of 300 millimeter. Where does that show up in terms of a relative differentiation? Like, we should it show up in faster sales growth rate, right? Or has it shown up in better gross margins? Or like where has it actually practically shown up in your P&L?
Dave Pahl
Yes. You can see it clearly is I think we qualified 300 millimeter back in 2009 the first products and we got our first revenue in 2010 up through this last year we produced 4.8 billion I believe of revenue, last year on 300, on 300 millimeter. And even if the beauty of going from 200 millimeter, I think kind of 8 inches to 300 or 12 inches the surface area of that wafer is 2.5 times bigger. And so if you're building the same product on that bigger sized wafer you get 2.25 times the number of products. But it doesn't take 2.25 times the number of people or electricity or gas and it just translates into a structurally lower cost.
So you've seen that show up in lower cost, higher gross margins whichever way you want to look at it. And I believe also there is a advantage of controlling those assets and owning them because as we've got 65, 70 product teams, as they have different requirements to make their products differentiated over time we've got more control of those assets. And for going to a foundry partner, trying to convince them to make changes to a standard based process technology. And that's not an advantage and so we’re going to show up on one quarter or probably even one year. But kind of like market share gains, you put that together over five and 10 and 20 years it's going to make a difference on the product portfolio.
Vivek Arya
All right. What percentage of your analog and embedded products are on 300 millimeter today and where do you see them going over the next few years? And I know you're planning to make further investments in 300 millimeter.
Dave Pahl
Yes. So analog roughly 45% of our revenue last year was on 300 millimeter. As you know we've got two wafer fabs that are in the footprint today, and we're in the planning process of the third and we just recently announced at Richardson, Texas would be the site of where we'll build that factory. We’ll probably break ground in the next couple of years. We've got some time to make that decision, but as Rich always says he wants to be two years early and not two months late with that capacity just because it's an asymmetric investment and it's just something that we want to do. So, think of every incremental dollar of analog that's coming in will be built on 300 millimeter. And that's pretty much what we've done over the last decade, embedded probably anything that's at 65 nanometer and below we're actually outsourcing today and we'll continue to outsource that. The most expensive part of our industry's manufacturing footprint is that advanced CMOS, and there's a portion of the product portfolio that will continue to build in-house.
Vivek Arya
So, what proportion of embedded is on 300?
Dave Pahl
Well, I would say most of it's on 300. Its embedded being more of a digitally based technology, the industry went 20, 25 years ago to 300, so that transition is mostly complete.
Vivek Arya
Got it. Make sense. There's access to 300 also give you a competitive advantage. Like when you go and talk with customers, are they more able to trust TI, because you have a lot of your own internal capacity and ways to scale that?
Dave Pahl
I think maybe on the margin as we talked about earlier and you can kind of think of our interaction with customers in two large fee reserves, demand creation and that's where engineers are choosing products and selecting, and then order fulfillment kind of once it goes to manufacturing and it's passed off over here. The order of fulfillment teams, the operations teams that our customers love the fact that we've got plenty of capacity, we've got 11 wafer fabs and our footprint give us any volume of -- we love those kind of problems to go off and solve. But at the same time we're servicing lots of small customers with lots of SKUs.
So you'll see us do programs like building inventory of small volume parts to ensure our lead times and availability remain high even for those types of customers that are in that footprint. So, I think all of those things kind of flow from strengthening those competitive advantages and ensuring that we're taking care of our customers.
Vivek Arya
Got it. Let me see if there are any questions from the audience. Okay. If not let me continue. On gross margins, you know your gross margins have you know are in the kind of low to mid 60s, the fall-through has been 75%. It's actually been higher over the last few years. So you have a good thing to have. So as you increase the amount of loading on 300 millimeter, should we anticipate higher gross margin fall-through?
Dave Pahl
Simple answer is yes. As every dollar comes in it'll just be structurally lower cost. And we've said, we've got in our capital management presentation that we did back in February. We've got an example of a part that sells for dollars at sixty point of gross profit on 200 millimeter you move that over to 300 millimeter and its 800 basis points higher in gross profit. So, we've said just on a blended basis at the company level that a dollar of revenue kind of fall through at 70 to 75 points. And it's not meant to be precisely mathematic but in any quarter it can vary as it often has. And -- but that's a reasonable way to think about that.
Vivek Arya
Got it. Is it fair to think Dave that a lot of the – I shouldn't call them easy pickings, but if I look historically over the last decade you've got automobile, there was a lot of benefit you had because depreciation was higher than CapEx. So, lot of those benefit seem to be in the rearview mirror, right. You're obviously on automobile. Depreciation is now actually equal or actually more than CapEx. So is there some stalling out of gross margins that you see at these levels?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I don't. I don't think so. I think if you -- if we translate into how we think about things, we're trying to optimize free cash flow per share growth over a long period of time. So, if you look at five, 10, 15 years of free cash flow growth it's been 11%, 12% kind of in that low double digit range over those periods of time. And that's for the most of that has been without any revenue growth on top of it. So, if you look going forward and talk about a semiconductor world, if GDP is 3%, semiconductors and you probably have an estimate 4%, 5%, some maybe at 6% but somewhere in that range, right. So if you have that as a starting base we think analog and embedded will grow about the rate of that of the industry overall. Good arguments for faster or slower, but they're big enough that they'll probably grow at the rate of the market.
And then every dollar that comes in falls through at 70 to 75 points, that's going to give you some lift on that free cash flow per share margin and maybe add another point or two. And then if Mr. Market behaves himself and we can continue to buy back shares. Can we reduce share count and grow that at another point or two faster. So, comfortably without twisting that spreadsheet you're probably somewhere in the upper single digits. And if all those things line up you're going to have a shot at something like we've done in the last five and 15 years, right. So that's kind of how we think about that growth overall and the opportunity in front of us.
Vivek Arya
I see. In terms of M&A it's been a few years since TI engaged, right, in any major acquisition. It's interesting that this year despite all the worries about broader cycle in China and environment I think they’ve had seven or eight semiconductor deals announced so far.
Dave Pahl
Crazy times.
Vivek Arya
So, right, crazy times, exactly. So when will TI become crazy the next time?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So we remain disciplined is probably the best way I’d say. And we've talked and it really remains unchanged for sometimes even before we bought National. And so strategically we'd look for an analog company, high quality products, diverse revenues. And I think an easy way to summarize it is would an acquisitions strengthen your competitive advantages or leverage them, and ideally like it to do both. And then kind of the second category is, does it make financial sense as an owner to allocate capital to that. And we'll look at a lot of different financial metrics of kind of the classic is your return on invested capital higher than your lack in a reasonable timeframe.
Some of my favorite are just looking at will our free cash flow per share will be growing faster five and 10 years from now with the acquisition than without it. And so those are kind of some of the hurdles that we've got and that's finding the targets not the difficult part in the equation that really is making sure that it makes financial sense as an owner to allocate the capital that way.
Vivek Arya
I see. So is it that there are not enough targets or is it that they are either too expensive or doesn't -- don't need the financing?
Dave Pahl
There’s plenty of targets out there, right. I don't think that's the issue. I think it's more of does it make financial sense to do.
Vivek Arya
Got it. And one thing we have seen is a lot of excitement in the whole 5G opportunity. I think TI -- you know you're definitely participating but you're not sounding as enthusiastic or jumping up and down about the 5G opportunity.
Dave Pahl
Have you seen us jump up and down about any opportunity, but 5G would be included.
Vivek Arya
But to the extent that there is going to be an upgrade cycle over the next handful of years, how is TI positioned? Which part of 5G do you have competitive differentiation? And do you think it's a real opportunity for you?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So it's clearly a real opportunity. Comms equipment is 11% of our revenue overall last year, and our basic thesis on comms equipment is that if you look at the world, the number of subscribers is saturated. The revenue per user hasn't moved in a very very long time. And you look at the ability of operators to double CapEx over the next five or 10 years just isn't there. And so the spending in that segment we don't believe for the industry overall could move up, sure, but is it going to double? I don't think it's going to double like we've talked about in some of those other markets over any time period that you're looking at.
So, with 5G in particular and if you go back to our capital management strategy and you'll see going back six, seven years is really when we began to invest in 5G. You saw that our digital investments are down and the analog investments are up slightly. Well, why is that? And if you look at the 5G opportunity, is really nothing going on new from the compression technique and what's required on the digital side. So, would we love to see that market continue to grow like it has over last 20 years? Absolutely. But probably more R&D into it, it’s not going to make the market grow.
Now, on the analog side to divide up the area around the base station, we’re just talking of macro based stations now to divide that up spatially, you need to have more than one antenna to steer energy, control more than one antenna you need analog products and that's where we're pointed. So, our revenues grew 30%, I think that's at the top of the list when you look at her peers this past quarter year-on-year. So we’re positioned very well and growing very well. But I also point out that market was declining double digits a year ago, so 30% sounds good. We've had and you look back over the last four years, we’ve had quarters where it declined 40% year-on-year. So I described it as choppy. I think I might use the word lumpy, means the same thing to me. So, it will be a good market. We’ll make good money in there, but might provide some growth, but not a significant growth
Vivek Arya
Got it. Great. I think with that we’re at the end of our time. Thank you so much. Dave. Really appreciate your insights. Thanks everyone for joining us.

Harlan Sur
All right. Good morning, and welcome to the second day of J.P. Morgan’s 47th Annual Technology, Media and Communications Conference. I'm Harlan Sur. I'm the Semiconductor and Semiconductor Capital Equipment Analyst for the firm. Very pleased to have Dave Pahl, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for Texas Instruments here with us today. I'll ask Dave to start off with some opening commentary and then we'll kick off the Q&A.
So with that, Dave, thank you for joining us this morning.
Dave Pahl
Thank you, Harlan. Thanks for having us again. If you're not familiar with Texas Instruments, we focus on what we think are the best markets and the best products in the semiconductor industry. The best products we believe are Analog and Embedded. They're good products because they have a lots of natural competitive modes that sit around them.
And if you look at us and look at our peers, many of them have great balance sheets and great income statements and very good positions in the market. The best markets, we believe, are both the automotive and the industrial markets. Out of the two of those, we're probably most excited about industrial.
It's already out twice as large as the automotive market is for us, and I think we can all – this really tell the content increases that are going into [indiscernible] over the last few years, and certainly that's going on inside of industrial. It's just harder to measure and certainly much more diverse, and those are some of the reasons that we like it.
I talked a little bit about how those two product areas are great quality product areas that us and our peers enjoy several of the benefits from, but what makes us unique is we’ve got four competitive advantages that taken together make us unique. And those are manufacturing and technology, and Harlan, I don't know if you're familiar with the 300-millimeter is probably the best demonstration of that.
Our broad product portfolio is the second, the reach of our market channels is third, and then the fourth one, which is usually understated, but very important is diversity and longevity. And diversity means we're not dependent on any particular customer or a particular market, particular technology, we’ll benefit from all of those things, but that will lead to a product portfolio that's long-lived. And I think from an owners' perspective can give a high confidence and terminal value of that product portfolio. So with that.
Harlan Sur
Great. Thank you for the opening commentary, and I’m going to start off with just the strong leadership position that Texas Instruments has in its markets and based off of the recent Gartner's share statistics for 2018 in Analog, for example. TI obviously, powerhouse and Analog semiconductor market share at 30%. You grew your franchise 300 basis points last year – 300 basis points faster than your overall markets, I see gain share in Analog for yet again another year. In your Embedded segment, Microcontrollers, you grew 200 basis points faster than the market. And in Embedded Processors, you grew over 400 basis points in that market.
So another strong showing in 2018 for the TI team in terms of market share grab and obviously the momentum we hope will continue on a go-forward basis, but success in these markets is defined not only by best-in-class products, but also your ability to work with your customers and help bring your customers faster to market and that involves things like systems-level expertise, software or firmware, what is it that TI is doing in these areas, the systems focus area to help accelerate your customers either productivity, time-to-market and so on?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So first I'll start with – I haven’t digested all that market report, and I just cautioned when we think of market share gains and we've been a share gainer for a long time, always look at it and kind of three and five and 10 and maybe even 20-year kind of horizons. And we've clearly been gaining share when you look at those types of things. I think we've been gaining share, first of all, you got to have great products like you’ve talked about.
We produce about 300 to 400 new products a year. We got about 65 to 70 product lines, where we've got managers that are looking for differentiated products that they can come to market, understand how long will have that differentiation versus our competitors, how many customers, how many end equipments, how many sectors, how many markets can we sell that product into, and what's the longevity of it. And so those are some of the characteristics that we look for, that's a high-quality investment.
And I would say the largest portion of our R&D goes into that effort and is driven by those product lines and then that's complemented by, what we call, Kilby Labs. And Kilby Labs is where we take longer-term investments perhaps new materials, new design techniques kind of breakthrough things, and we've seen things come out of Kilby Labs like our millimeter wave sensors that you can use for radar systems and other techniques or our magnetic flux sensors that have come through there or new materials like our gain products or isolation products that you can use in battery-based systems and EVs and things like that.
So it's really a combination of those plus the investments in our competitive advantages, things like our reach of our channel and making it easier for a designer to select our products, and we've got a portfolio of tens and thousands of products. And how do we make relevant to that engineer making a decision. So it's not one thing, it's a combination of a lot.
Harlan Sur
Great. Well, congrats to the team another strong show in 2019. I'm looking more into the product focus a little bit later, but obviously top most on investors – a lot of investors mind from a near-term perspective, the market continues to be concerned about the current environment with well known slowdown in industrial, China-U.S. trade tensions, slowdown in auto, especially in China and Europe.
Under recent earnings call few weeks back, you talked about historically kind of four or five quarter year-over-year decline before seeing a recovery, once we start to get into sort of the cyclical downturn, the March quarter being the second quarter of year-over-year declines, from where you stand today? From where the team sits today? What are some of the trends that the Company is seeing in your end markets? And is the team seen any signs of stabilization that some of your Analog and microcontroller peers are pointing to?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I would say that couple of things. One is that, and I think you characterized it exactly correct, but I'll just restate it for an emphasis. As we look back over 30 years, I think, we've seen nine up cycles, and we're living through the ninth down cycle.
And when we're looking at we're kind of looking at when did the market go negative from a year-on-year growth standpoint, and there are some of those that if you look around our monthly basis, it might only be three months and the longest one was something like 22 months or something like that.
So you could judge it four to five. You could say its three to six. That encourage anyone to take a look at the data and we're not trying to predict what's going to happen this time. So if you just look at the facts, this is – we just completed the second quarter. I caution and say the fourth quarter was the first quarter that we had negative growth.
Harlan Sur
Yes.
Dave Pahl
It’s only down 1%. So may be a better way to characterize it is where a little more than one quarter into the correction, technically it's two. And operating, we pull back on wafer starts. That conserves cash upfront. And if you look at our free cash flow generation, tends to be a lot more stable than the topline because of actions like that.
As those lower wafer starts make their way through and begin to burn inventory, inventory becomes a source of cash. And so you kind of think of that is somewhat as a shock absorbers on the business model that provides us much more stable cash generation.
So we're running our factories at a levels. We don't want to run them too lien so that if things strengthen from here that we're in a position to support it and certainly we're at a position things we confirm here, we can take wafer starts down further.
Harlan Sur
And given your global market share and just the broad end market exposure that the team has, help us understand where TI has been impacted the most from all of the U.S. sort of China trade friction? I'm not sure if you can one or two areas where the team has really been impacted?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So first, direct impact, I think it is easiest to quantify because it doesn't exist. So and for our industry, generally the definition of direct impact is simply test of a product in China, it's then shipped into the U.S. now. If it was defined some other way, we've got almost a dozen wafer fabs in our footprint and half a dozen assembly test sites. So we're probably in a better position than most of that we able to mitigate that if we had to. Right now, there is essentially no impact directly.
The secondary impact meaning the impact to our customers, and then tertiary in the global economy, I just say that we're big supporters of free trade. We don't like tariffs, but if they exist, that will exist in the industry and we'll have to operate in that environment.
Harlan Sur
Great. Let's go back to the design win, traction and the strong market share gains. I think one of the tailwinds for Texas Instruments team as it relates to market share or growth is, you discussed previously having the larger sales organization and comprehensive website has been competitively differentiated for the team.
Can you just provide us with some tangible examples of how does the team leverages big sales force and website relative to your competition in order to maintain the leadership and continue this year-over-year sort of trajectory of gaining share?
Dave Pahl
I think as I mentioned earlier, the reach of our channels is one of the four competitive advantages, and it works very closely with the other one, which is the broad product portfolio. So if you look at all the subcategories of Analog and then subcategories of Embedded, we've got a strong product position across that board.
And our customers really don't care whether you got a strong product position. What an engineer cares about when they're working through a circuit design is do you have the right product that meets the requirements that I need, the right voltages, the right current levels, the right IOs and outputs.
And the average selling price of an Analog product in the industry is about $0.35. So they're not picking those products, whether it's $0.36 or $0.34 they're trying to solve that design challenge that they have. So our sales team gives us access we can just call on more customers directly.
We got apps teams that can work with customers when they have technical questions and solve those more quickly in our website, as an example, draws more customers, because of that broad product portfolio and regardless of what they're looking for, we'll have something that we can offer them. And then when we do engage with them, we've got the opportunity to cross-sell them across more products.
And when they're on their website, trying to make that time productive for that engineer and going from tens of thousands of products down to the couple of dozen, very quickly we know that, that engineers interested in as an example, is all part of that strength of that competitive advantage.
Harlan Sur
My understanding is that the team has a lot of analytics horsepower behind your website. And so helping customers trying to predict where – what customers are trying to do and what products that they need as soon as they get onto the website? Maybe you can describe more about the process and the team that kind of supports that website analytics initiative?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I don’t know if you’re listening to the Jamie Dimon talk about the efforts here at J.P. Morgan. So I think those are fairly common, but customers aren't interested in tens of thousands of products. So it's going to be a handful of products that they're interested in.
So trying to get down to those that handful of products, ensure that those are in front of that engineer when they're making that decision. And then we have end equipment team. So you've seen before that we have, what we call, markets that we look at auto industrial, comps equipment, personal electronics and enterprise and then under each of those, we got what we call sector.
So inside of industrial, we've got 13 different sectors. We've got a team of people working on all 13 of those. We've got hundreds of what we call end equipments that sit underneath those sectors, and those end equipment teams look at our product set and that really is kind of gives us the backbone that allows us to get the right products in front of those customers.
So our breadth means that we can afford to have more end equipment teams, we can focus on more things, we got the products that will go into them and because of that, that we have got the return to make those investments and we think that's something that many of our peers just couldn't do.
Harlan Sur
Before I get into some of the product categories, maybe why don't we just open up and see if there any questions. If you do have questions, please wait for the microphone? Okay. So why don't we talk about some of the product in end market sort of areas? On Embedded, connected MCU and processor, if you were to create a pie chart, and as I mentioned, you gained share in both of those segments in 2018. If you were to create a pie chart in terms of exposure, where would the three biggest areas exposure be for your Embedded products?
Dave Pahl
It would be industrial and automotive. I think makeup 75% or so of that market comps equipment will be next, and I think there is very little PE and very little enterprise systems.
Harlan Sur
And so for example, let's take your flagship segments of industrial and automotive – let's just take automotive for a second. So on the MCU front, where will we find a bunch of the TI MCUs in automotive?
Dave Pahl
Well, that's the beauty is that we service about 1,000 different automotive OEMs. Now, of course, the handful of very large ones will probably ship a couple of 1,000 different SKUs or products into those larger Tier 1 OEMs, but it's very, very diverse.
And when we look at investments, we look across those sectors, as I described before, and we're getting growth from all five sectors, but four of them are growing significantly like ADAS, Infotainment, Powertrain, which includes electric vehicles and hybrids and then body and lighting. So there maybe Microcontrollers inside of the multiple motors that control the seat.
The AV system and the ductwork for climate control number, there maybe their Microcontrollers even in turn signals as an example, and that falls inside the body and lighting. So there are a lot of companies that stand up and talk about ADAS and all that other type of stuff, which is very exciting, but we joke that our teams get just as excited about turn signals because there is couple of dollar content and something is boring as that.
Harlan Sur
I apologize, but I wanted to rewind back a little bit to sort of the fundamental environment. There is one question I've got to ask which is that as you looked into the June quarter, help us understand what were some of the end market sort of geographical sort of trends that you were seeing that helped the team come up with its June quarter guidance?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So I think if you look at the June quarter, the midpoint of our guidance, I would suggest the revenues declined about 10% year-on-year. The best explanation…
Harlan Sur
And roughly flattish sequentially.
Dave Pahl
And roughly – that’s right, and roughly flattish sequentially. The best description of why that is we're a little more than one quarter into just a semiconductor cycle. Now if there is any one particular market or customer or geography that's driving unusual behavior will call that out, but we would point back to look at the macroenvironment and semiconductor environment in particular to help explain those results.
Harlan Sur
One of the areas you did point out though very clearly was your 5G cellular infrastructure business. I wonder if you could talk about some of the trends there. It's been strong for the team, but you also characterized it as lumpy and the question we get from investors is what is TI mean by lumpy as it on for two quarters, off for one quarter, service provider dependent, if you can help us out there?
Dave Pahl
Yes. And couple of people at our company gave me a hard time for using the word lumpy, and what I know if it's different than choppy, and just using the words that kind of mean the same thing at least to me. But I think if you look at that market and look at it over 10 and 20 years, it is characterized as being choppy or lumpy, whichever your favorite term is.
We've had quarters where we've seen year-on-year declines in the past as much as 40%, now it's growing at 30% year-on-year, and we have – we’re benefiting from decision we made going back a decade ago to shift investments to 5G and specifically in Analog, and we're seeing the benefits of that.
So that is a good market, that's one that we continue to invest in. But we're just cautious to make sure everybody knows that markets typically behave the way that they have in the past. We also pointed out we're up 30% year-on-year, but, I think, we’re down double-digits a year-ago. So some of that benefit, it's a weak compare. But it's a market we like and market that we'll continue to invest in.
Harlan Sur
And what was your expectations for based in the June quarter guidance in terms of geographical demand trends?
Dave Pahl
We haven’t provided any guidance by geography or product or other cuts. And again if there was something very unusual going on, we would call it out. And our guidance, I think, was kind of very consistent with what kind of being somewhere in the down part of the semiconductor cycle.
Harlan Sur
Let’s talk about – we talked about the Embedded, so connected MCU, and processor, let's talk about Analog. So again number one market share, you took share last year. Obviously, I think most of us know that your powerhouse in Power Management, but you also do have actually quite good share in the other parts of high-performance Analog, inverters, amplifiers, interface. And so what is Texas Instruments doing to sort of beef up your share capabilities in some of these areas outside of Power Management?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think if you look at our share gains, certainly it's been the Power Management, but it’s also been in Signal Chain products as well. And there again, I would go back to how we allocate capital and R&D, we try to make our investments and products as efficient as we can that process hasn't changed dramatically in the last decade or so.
And we just have a process of trying to find the best opportunities to make the investments. We also make core investments and one of our competitor advantages is manufacturing and technology. There we control those assets and when you have a product line that needs a slight tweak or slightly different feature in a silicon process, we can put that tweak in.
Is that going to show up in any one quarter or any one year's market share numbers are probably won't, but over 5-year and 10-year and 20-year time periods, controlling those assets and being able to have that flexibility continue to make our product lines stronger.
So again, I think that's kind of the beauty of the markets that we're in. It's double edge sword of market share is very tough to move, but if we can just be consistent at it over a long period of time, it will be very meaningful to the topline and to – and the free cash flow growth.
Harlan Sur
TI has obviously really focused on the market on its cost competitive advantage with their 300 millimeter manufacturing assets. Less understood, I think is that part of the product leadership perspective is TI's leadership not only in design capability, but also process technologies.
And so I guess, the question is looking under the hood, low voltage, high voltage, RF, microwave, new areas such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride that you might have talked about. How many different process technologies does TI support internally for the Analog division? And is it – as I would characterize it, is it a big differentiator for the TI team?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So first of all, it is the kind of the fuel that goes into the engine, right. Great process technologies and then design tools, because our industry unlike on the digital side that has tools that abstract that technology and things like cadence or mentor, those types of tools that abstract that. You don't have those same type of tools on the Analog side.
So we've got to develop those tools, develop the process technologies and that's really the gas in the engine that our design engineers have to drive those products that product differentiation that we talked about.
Again so another nod on that is the ability when we own those factories and control that, we can just push that a little bit harder than you'd be able to in other places. And again I don't think that that's something that will ever show up in one quarter, but overtime does it make your product portfolio stronger and give you the advantage to do things that others just can't do, because you just got more degrees of freedom.
Harlan Sur
Any questions from the audience? Why don’t we wait for the – we got a few up here. Why don’t we go with Sean first right here?

2019-05-15,Q&A," Session
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Hi, Dave. Can you just give us kind of an update on the launch of your new 300-millimeter fab kind of the timing does affect of that were currently in a downturn, does have any effect on kind of the timing of when you need to ramp your new fab?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So just the timing of our next factory. We just recently announced that we've chosen the site, obviously an important step in the process. We're going to build it next to our existing – one of our existing 300-millimeter fabs in Richardson, Texas. That fab when it's equipped will support above $5 billion worth of revenue. We said that we're going to make the decision in the next couple of years to break ground. If you kind of think about what drives that timing, we finished last year with about $3 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity.
Our Analog business is roughly a $10 billion business. So where we're starting first quarter and have guided second quarter too, growth would be tougher to come by this year. But if we grew at upper single-digits or low double-digits, that's says that we probably have three, four years before we have to have that capacity. And that's probably on the inside, because growing at those rates are probably unrealistic. So that's kind of what drives the next couple of years and certainly environment plays a role in that decision.
Harlan Sur
Maybe to follow-on from Sean's point though, the shell is going to go up earlier, so any timing on the shell – when the shell you think…
Dave Pahl
And that's what we kind of describe just the next year or two. That is the long pull in the process. That will cost us $600 million to $700 million when we break that ground, and it will take us 18 months, may be two years somewhere in that timeframe to complete the building [indiscernible].
Harlan Sur
I think we had a question here.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. You guys done a great job in recent years in terms of taking opportunities like this to kind of build some smaller batch stuff, long life stuff, kit factories et cetera. Is there anything we can do from the outside to understand kind of where we are in that opportunity? Is that extend through the down cycle or kind of is that out at some point, how do we think about that?
Dave Pahl
Sure. Yes. So if I put it into context and we think about our four competitive advantages and one of them is to reach the channel, we've had teams that go off and try to figure out ways to strengthen our relationship with our customers have a more direct closer relationship.
One of those ways is by owning and controlling our inventory in the channel. So it's kind of an outcome of that that's why we put in place consignment inventory and that's putting pressure on inventories up. We got about two-thirds of our revenues now supported by consignment.
And as we complete this next phase, we'll probably push somewhere near 70% of our revenues on consignment. Another element of that is, as you pointed out, is during periods of weaker demand, we built low volume parts that we believe will be long-lived and we're doing that so that our lead times and the availability of that product is very high kind of throughout all the cycles.
So that's the reason that we're doing it now. Operationally, that allows us to run our factories a little bit more stable than they otherwise would, that will drive some other efficiencies back. But the reason why we're doing is to ensure they have very good customer service.
So last quarter, we continue to make progress on it. We continue to make progress on it this quarter, and the consignment piece, we said, will probably take to the end of this year before we're completely done with the phase. So maybe next quarter or the quarter after, it really just depends on how demand shapes as we move through the back half of the year.
Harlan Sur
Any more questions?
Unidentified Analyst
All right. Thank you. I would like to ask you about the capital allocation. So as you know, the Company leverages pretty low, one of the lowest compared to the peers, high single credit ratings. I just want to – your thoughts, is there where you see it's an ideal level you want to be? Or is there any room flexibility you want to lever up if you see the right opportunities?
Dave Pahl
Yes. And just to make sure I understand your question is, specifically in capital allocation and there is a room to lever up significantly. So yes, it's great question. We think about debt. We think of it as a way to increase returns for long-term owners that we're comfortable carrying debt because of our business model as long as the economics make sense.
And obviously, we think they make sense today if you've looked, we’ve taken a very cautious approach to debt and we don’t have any lurching moves in it. We’re pretty – still even today pretty close to debt neutral. I would say, on our balance sheet, we probably have more cash than we actually need to operate the company, and we certainly have a lot more capacity to take on debt.
But if you look at us in 5-year and 10-year and 15-year period, we do have a commitment to return all free cash flow to our customers. This past quarter, we returned just a little more than 40% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and the balance went to share buybacks.
And in fact, we bought back about 120% of free cash flow from our buybacks. So some of that came from reduction in cash, some of it came from issuance of new debt. So again, I would just look back at history, and I wouldn't expect any lurching moves on it, but we are comfortable carrying debt.
Harlan Sur
12% free cash flow per share growth over the past 13 years up 33% in 2018 obviously a great track record here. In a normalized demand environment, you’ve got revenue growth, you’ve got margin expansion combined with your focus on share count reduction through share repurchases. Should we continue to expect TI to grow its free cash flow per share at a double-digits CAGR? Or how should we think about it?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think it's a great question. I think the first and most important thing we think is growing the topline. And if the semiconductor industry grows 4% maybe 5% and for gaining share, we can maybe add a point or two to that growth. So comfortably get us mid single-digits and start to push into upper single-digits. Every dollar that comes in, we build on 300-millimeter, that's going to give us a structurally lower cost. That will accelerate free cash flow by a point or two over a longer period of time.
And then lastly, that will be taxed on its way to free cash flow. And if we – Mr. Market continues to behave themselves and we can continue to buy shares, that's added another point or two to free cash flow growth. So that says comfortably you can get somewhere in the upper single-digits and maybe have shot at getting double-digits when you're looking at five and 10 years or longer growth.
Harlan Sur
Great. And then my last question is, last year, the team drove 38% free cash flow margins up from 31% in the prior year, obviously increasing mix of revenues to 300-millimeter is a big driver of that, leverage on the OpEx is another driver.
On that note, given your scale, I think your rule of thumb on OpEx is always been 20% to 25% of revenues seems a bit outdated, because even here in the June quarter, let's assume that we're somewhere near the trough of the cycle, your OpEx is still only 22% of revenues. So you're a much bigger company, more scaled. Any plans to tighten the range on your OpEx view through cycle?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think when we provide those numbers, it's just a general way to think of the model. As we allocate capital, we talked a little bit about how we do that in R&D kind of getting the dollars to the best places. If we felt by increasing the number of products as an example that we do, if we went from 300-to-400 to 600-to-800, if that would change the trajectory of the topline, we've got the cash to do it.
Same thing with investments and SG&A with things like ti.com and other initiatives that we have like this consignment programs, so we're not capital constrain, but as owners of the company, we want to allocate that capital efficiently.
So again there is no limit to add 20%, but it's a guideline that's not how we think of when we allocate that capital. We're not taking a percent of revenue, but that's just an outcome, and our focus really remains, as owners of the Company, to grow free cash flow per share, as fast as possible over a long period of time. And if we’re able to do that, I think, all of our owners will be happy.
Harlan Sur
Dave, thank you very much. Appreciate, you joining us here this morning.
Dave Pahl
Yes. Thank you.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Q1 2019 earnings release call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I will be covering the following topics. First, a high-level summary of the financial results for the first quarter. Second, I will provide some details of the first quarter by segment and end-market. And third, I will include some additional color in light of the market weakness we are currently experiencing. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results, a brief comment on the status of our next 300 millimeter fab, and then the outlook. Then, we will open the call for Q&A.
Now starting with the high-level summary of our first quarter financial results. The weakness in demand that began in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter. The weakness was across all markets with the exception of communications equipment. In our core businesses, analog revenue declined 2% and embedded processing revenue declined 14% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Both businesses’ year-on-year growth decelerated as we expected at this point in the cycle.
Similar to the fourth quarter, embedded remained weaker than analog, primarily because it didn't benefit from increasing content in 5G. Operating margin decreased in both businesses. Reduced factory loadings affected both businesses, but the impact was greater in analog since more of its supply comes from internal manufacturing. Overall revenue in the first quarter decreased 5% from a year ago and earnings per share were $1.26, including a $0.04 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance.
With that backdrop, I will now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow to owners.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month period was $6 billion, up 22% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.4% of revenue, up from 32.1% from a year ago. We continued to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases, demonstrating our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all our free cash flow to owners.
Moving on, I will now provide some details of the first quarter by segment and end-market and then offer some additional color on the market. From a year-ago quarter, analog revenue declined 2% due to high volume and power, partially offset by growth in signal chains. I will note that the strength in communications equipment minimized analog's decline. Embedded processing revenue declined by 14% from a year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines, processors, and connected microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined 6% from a year ago.
Now given the current weaker market environment, I wanted to provide some additional color on the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the weakness in demand for our products that began in the second half of 2018 continued into the first quarter. Demand came in mostly as expected, although communications equipment was stronger than expected due to shipments of products that support 5G.
Next, I will provide some insight into this quarter's performance by end-market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive declined mid-single digits due to broad-based weakness. We continue to focus our investments across 13 sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive. Despite this near-term weakness, we continue to believe these investments will deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term.
Personal electronics declined low double digits due to broad-based weakness, including mobile phones and PCs. In contrast, communications equipment grew about 30% year-on-year, and as we mentioned earlier, benefiting both from 5G shipments as well as an easy compare due to weakness in the year ago period. History would suggest that we should expect this market to be choppy in the future. And then lastly, enterprise systems declined. Looking at these end-markets on a regional basis, generally all the regions performed consistently, excluding the positive effects of communications equipment.
So in summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on the belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and they also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.26 billion or 62.9% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 170 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $803 million, down about 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.7% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our topline over the long term. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of this year, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.38 billion or 38.4% of revenue. Operating profit was down 11% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 43.2%, down from 45.4% a year ago and for embedded processing was 31.3%, down from 35.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over time. Net income in the first quarter was $1.22 billion, or $1.26 per share, which included a $0.04 discrete tax benefit not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $251 million in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.99 billion. In the first quarter, we paid $724 million in dividends and repurchased $1.15 billion of our stock for a total return to owners of $1.88 billion.
In total, we have returned $8.05 billion in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.09 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is $5.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.91%.
Inventory days were 144, up eight days from a year ago and down eight days sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we have made replenishing inventory of low volume devices and implementing the next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. Work in both of these areas will continue in the second quarter. We believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory and will manage it with our long-term objectives in mind.
Next, as we mentioned earlier, we want to update you on our next 300 millimeter wafer fab. As you may have seen, we have chosen Richardson, Texas, as the site for our next wafer fab. The new building will be on our existing site in Richardson. We have not announced a specific construction timetable yet, but as we indicated during the February Capital Management call, we would expect to get started in the next few years.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.46 billion to $3.74 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.32, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 16% in 2019.
In closing, as we said last quarter, we believe that after 10 quarters of year-on-year growth, the weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. We have just completed our second quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. If you look at history, cycles are always different, but typically the industry would have four to five quarters of year-on-year declines before year-on-year growth resumes. We are not trying to forecast the cycle, but simply offer some historical perspective.
Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long term, while remaining diligent in the short term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, analog and embedded processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

[Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. I am kind of thinking how to interpret your Q2 outlook. One interpretation is that you are not really seeing much recovery off of Q1, right, which is kind of surprising when we hear of China PMI improving and all the optimism about some signs of recovery. The other interpretation is that maybe Q1 you saw the extra benefit from comm equipment. So if I exclude that, then you are seeing some modest pickup going into Q2. So I am just curious, how are you thinking about your Q2 outlook versus seasonally, which is supposed to be up 7%, 8% sequentially?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Vivek, I would say, certainly, I can confirm the first part of the question that in first quarter, we did get a benefit from comms equipment. That's just in the numbers. I think when we look at our second quarter outlook and we put that together, again we base that on the orders that we get from customers as well as the demand feeds that we get through our consignment programs. And just as a reminder, about two-thirds of our revenue comes through those consignment programs.
And for OEMs, we will typically get six months of visibility and there is no inventory that sits in front of us in that manufacturing line. So, it really is one of the best signals that we can get. And I also would caution that that doesn't mean that that signal can't change very quickly. So, that's how we are basing the guidance for the second quarter, and I will leave further interpretation to you.
Do you have follow-up?
Vivek Arya
Yes. Thanks Dave. So maybe if I ask the question in a different way. Have you seen any pickup in orders over the last few weeks versus let's say the first few weeks of the year?
Dave Pahl
Well, I would say that orders behaved normally in the quarter. And again, two-thirds of our revenue is coming through on consignment. So, we will get an order when that product is due to ship and that happens instantaneously. So, orders are probably less of the strongest signal that we will get versus those demand signals that we get from orders.
So, thank you, Vivek. And we will go to next caller please.
Operator
We will go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes. Thanks guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Rafael, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the utilization actions you are taking? How much of a hit were they to the calendar first quarter gross margins? And I guess more importantly, I know it takes time for utilization actions to go through the P&L, but have the utilization rates now bottomed and how do you think about utilization relative to Q2 gross margins and going throughout the remainder of the year?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me try to frame that for you a little bit. Over the last couple of quarters, we have talked about how we are going to decrease our wafer starts to adjust to the expectations of revenue, while at the same time we are going to increase the portion or a dedicate portion of those wafers to building our low-volume industrial consignment or industrial buffer parts, and also the transition to consignment. So, we did those things and our operating plan did reduce, and we did take a hit to gross margins in that process, and that's what you are seeing in our P&L.
Now what I would sort of take you back to is look at it from a free cash flow standpoint, because ultimately that's what matters, right. What you are seeing from a utilization charges standpoint is a non-cash expense. At the end of the day, what we are focused on is allocating capital and allocating cash, right. So, by decreasing those wafer starts, what we did was dedicating less cash to that.
So in fact, leaving out more cash for the owners of the company, but generating enough inventory or the right amount of inventory to be prepared for the revenue that we want to meet in the future, and also to build those buffer inventory stocks so that we are prepared for future quarters and have the ability to meet customer expectations and customer satisfaction, which ultimately is what we are trying to do with that inventory so that it helps us position ourselves to meet those customer demands and help with our goal of continuing to grow the topline for a long time to come. 
Dave Pahl
Yes. Just a number on that, I think if you look at our first quarter, trailing 12-month free cash flow is at 38.4%. That was the same that we had last quarter, so it didn't change much.
Do you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer
Yes. Dave, just going back to the revenue guidance for the calendar second quarter, if you look at how that business has historically performed, I think I need to go back to 2001 to see a calendar second quarter that was down sequentially, and that was sort of in the wake of the tech bubble. Again, I am just trying to get a sense of what you are seeing in the bottoms up business to potentially have a scenario when they are of down sequential revenue? And I guess you mentioned in your prepared comments that the comms business can be lumpy historically. Is embedded in the Q2 guidance still good lumpiness or would you expect that lumpiness in the comms sector?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So I would say, first, if you look over, and you know this very well, John, if you look over 10, 15, 25 years of the comms equipment market, that business is lumpy. It's lumpy because of the way that operators put out tenders and place the orders and the OEMs, our customers, have to build to those. So history just says that you should be mindful of that and that doesn't make it a bad business. It's just an attribute of it.
And so, I think in the second quarter, I would remind you that we just completed the second quarter of year-on-year declines for TI. It's not likely that cycles, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, can last four or five quarters. Sometimes, they can be shorter and sometimes they can be longer than that, but we are two quarters into that. And per our practice, if there was something significant or unusual going on in our guidance, either by end-markets or a particular customer, we would make those things clear to help you understand it.
So, okay. Thank you, John. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
We will go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
Guys, thanks for taking my questions. Again, I want to push on the comm point a little bit. I know analog and embedded have diverged, partially because of this. If it wasn't for the upside on comm. and analog, do you think it would be seeing similar year-over-year trends without the strength in comm as well as in the embedded?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Stacy, they would be much closer. I think there are still some differences, but directionally all the end-markets are the same and they would maybe much closer from year-over-year decline standpoint.
Do you have a follow-on?
Stacy Rasgon
I do. Again, I want to follow-up still on comm. So we are seeing very strong ups I mean, I guess the first part of it is sort of I think you mentioned this that the upside versus guidance in the quarter that was all comm. So the rest of the business came in as expected. And I guess just secondly on how concerned are you, what's the possibility that the current strength we would see in comm is not actually matched and then ultimately worried about like order pull-forwards and most of the things from some of the larger customers? Like what are you seeing along those lines around the sustainability of the upside that we are seeing in comm now I guess over the medium to long term?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So I would say that the upside that we saw was almost all from comms. I think that the rest of the markets and businesses, if you looked at it from that way, performed about as we expected. And the comments on what the future of that looks like, I would just go back to the statements that we made before and just staring at history of that market it tends to be choppy.
So would we expect it to be choppy in the future? We would. That's not a comment on second quarter or third or fourth. It's just the comment of looking at history that that market just tends to be choppy.
So okay. Thank you Stacy. We will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We will go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, will your factory loadings go up sequentially in this quarter versus last quarter? Or are they going to be going down? I am try to understand if you believe inventories are going to be a source or use of cash this quarter?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. Last quarter we characterized that, because it was more relevant at the time given the inflection point on our revenue. Now that the midpoint of our revenue is about the same as the first quarter, I think it's time to just not focus on that and focus on the other things that we think are more important longer term, which is our ability to continue to grow the topline as we focus on analog and embedded industrial automotive.
And with that as we focus on growing free cash flow for the long-term, as Dave mentioned earlier and we mentioned during the call, despite the drop in gross margin and the drop in utilization, our free cash flow on the trailing 12-months was essentially unchanged from 90 days ago. And as a percent of revenue, it was 38.4%, right.
Dave Pahl
And I think that just speaks to the quality of the business model that topline can change quite a bit, but if you look at that trailing 12-months free cash flow, it just tends to be much more stable. And that just speaks to the quality of the model.
Mark, do have a follow on?
Mark Lipacis
Yes. Thank you. Dave, in your script you said, I may have misunderstood this, but you said that regionally the business trends were consistent except for communications equipment. I don't think I really quite understand that. I am hoping you can just spell that statement out for me? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Yes. So that you can think of the largest manufacturers of communications equipment, we try not to go by customer of who those are. But there are only a couple of regions in which they exist. And so you can imagine that you can connect those two pieces of information together. So hopefully that helps.
Thank you Mark. We will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We will go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. I had a follow-up on the comm segment. Dave, you talked about the business being up 30% year-over-year. What was embedded in your original guide for the first quarter?
Dave Pahl
Well again, I think that overall our revenue came within the range of our expected guidance. It was in the upper half primarily because of the strength that we saw in comms equipment.
Toshiya Hari
Okay. Got it. And then as a quick follow-up for Rafael. I wanted to get an update on your thoughts on capital return. Your stock is back up to now quite your 52-week high, but pretty close. How should we think about buybacks versus dividends versus other uses of cash going forward? Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. And I am happy to address that, Toshiya. First let me take everybody back to our capital management strategy, the objective that we talk about. And when it comes to cash return, our objective there is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company via buybacks and dividends. And we think that we recognize that sometimes you strategically build cash, sometimes you strategically drain cash, right. So then you can actually return more than 100% of free cash flow, as frankly we have done for the last few years.
But on the two pieces, so dividends and buybacks. On dividends, the goal is to provide a sustainable and growing dividend and we target to be somewhere between 40% to 60% of free cash flow. At the moment, on the trailing 12-month basis, we are at 45%.
And then on the repurchases is the creative capture of future free cash flow for the long-term owners. But that essentially means, so let me dive a little deeper on repurchases because I think that's where your question is going. We use reasonable assumptions, not aggressive, not conservative, but reasonable assumptions of our expected growth of free cash flow per share for the company for a long time to come and then based on that, we develop our assessment on valuation of intrinsic value of the company. And then we compare that to their market price and depending on the divergence of those, we buy back.
So as long as this is below their intrinsic and higher than market price, we will be buying back shares and how much it depends on their divergence, right. So you can see our history of the last year-and-a-half or so. I mean we have been returning significantly more than 100% of free cash flow as we do that assessment. But as long as the intrinsic value is higher than the market price, we will buy back shares in the open market.
With that, do you have a follow-up?
Dave Pahl
No, that was his follow-up. We will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We will go next to Chris Danley with Citigroup.
Dave Pahl
I think he got muted.
Operator
Mr. Danley, your line is open.
Chris Danley
Yes. Hi guys. I heard that the operator came on. Anyway, my question is on trends over in China. Can you just comment on how the order trends have gone over there over the last three months? Have you seen any stabilization? And then any words you can give us on distribution inventory as well?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Chris, I would say that as we said in the prepared remarks that really all the regions performed similarly with the exception of comms equipment that we talked about. All of our markets were pretty consistent this quarter. Distributor inventories were up a little more than a day sequentially to just a little over four-and-a-half weeks.
Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Chris Danley
Yes I do. So a bit of a longer-term question. I will break with [indiscernible] them on the call. If we look at your ""other revenue"", it's like a 8% of sales now and the operating margin has been sort of steadily trending down over the last few years and I think in the most recent quarter was 15%. So it was about 25% below the corporate average. A, why is that operating margin so low? What's going on there? And then B, why not just start shutting down or ending life of those products?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. A couple of things on that. Recently, in this last quarter, we did have a decrease inside of that business within our DLP business but a lot of that was due to this consignment transition that we have talked about. So that's part of what drove the short-term and also maybe some of what the margin issue that you are attributing to.
I would also remind you that some of the acquisition charges for example, restructuring charges, that's all in that other piece. Remember, especially on the acquisition charge, that's non-cash. So elsewhere that represents cash that went out the door about eight years ago. So you adjust for that. That maybe gives you a better picture.
And lastly, we do have the customized piece there, couple of hundred million still left per year there and over the next two, three, four years that will trend to zero. The rest of the business should be fairly steady and inside of other.
Dave Pahl
Yes. And the other comment that I would make, Chris, you can see the seasonality of calculator not only in the revenues but you can see it in the operating margin. So almost all of those revenues come for back to school. So we will see that at the end of the second quarter and the beginning of third. But obviously, the expenses for that business carry out throughout the whole year. So always you will see because that revenue comes in, in that short period of time, the operating margins in those two quarters look much nicer.
And the last comment I will make and we kind of joke about, we should have come up with a more creative name for other, like other good stuff or something like that. So those businesses generate lots of cash for us. And they don't take a lot of resources to maintain them. So that's why they remain in the family.
So with that, I think we have got time for one more caller.
Operator
We will go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
Hi. I just had a question on the genesis that some of the inventory related weakness you are seeing. We saw last year some of the tightness of things that TI doesn't sell, like MLCC capacitors and things like that where the lead times got really inflated and clearly that's corrected now. I guess as you look back on that, do you think that that triggered inventory of TI components to get built? And where do you think we are in sort of that cycle playing its way through in terms of shortages of other components that TI can't control?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think Joe that as you are describing it, that's kind of what drives semiconductor cycles, right. I think that if you think of a customer wherever they are in the world and they start to get notified from their suppliers and our peers that their lead times are going out, even though ours aren't going out, they may decide to proactively take their inventory position from six weeks to nine weeks over a 90-day period. And that will drive strength in the business overall and 90-days later they decide to go from nine weeks to 12 weeks of inventory, because things look like they are getting even tighter. And then, once they get comfortable, it moves back in the other way.
So as you watch that play out, we had 10 quarters of very strong growth. Most of that was double digit. I think most people when they looked at that would describe that as above trend and what follows 10 quarters of running above trend is a few quarters that will run below.
So you have follow-on, Joe?
Joe Moore
Yes. And I guess you may have touched on this and I missed it. But any change in your own lead times over the last three months?
Dave Pahl
Generally our lead times have remained stable. Even through the period of very strong demand, our lead times had remained stable. I think that you can always find pockets just as you can today where we will work with customers very aggressively to close. And I think another important metric that we track, Joe, is on time delivery and those have remained very, very high. Other customer service metrics remained very high. So meaning that, if someone does come and order products at lead time, are we shipping them to the commitments that we have got and those remained high through that whole cycle.
And some of the things that we are doing like building inventory of low volume parts during this peak period of weaker demand, we are doing that to ensure that we can continue to deliver product consistently to customers. That's really what's driving that. That and the visibility that we get through programs like consignment, kind of a combination of those things, we are actually doing other things around inventory positions and order entry and we have summarized that as really the belief that their strategic value in owning and controlling that inventory and keeping it on our balance sheet.
So with that, I will turn it over to Rafael to wrap things up for us.
Rafael Lizardi
All right. Thanks Dave. Let me finish with a few comments on key items for you to remember. First, as we mentioned last quarter, we will stay focused on what will make us stronger long term and diligent in the short term. Second, we will remain focused on analog and embedded, the best products and industrial and automotive, the best markets. And third, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning free cash flow to the owners of the company.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments 4Q '18 and 2018 Year-End Earnings Release Conference. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call to review our Capital Management Strategy on February 5 at 10 AM Central Time. Similar to what we have done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy.
For today's call, let me start by summarizing what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll be covering three topics: first, a high-level summary of the financial results for the fourth quarter. Second, I'll provide some details of the fourth quarter by segment and end market, and I'll include some additional color in light of the market weakness we are currently experiencing. And finally, since this is the end of a calendar year, I will provide a summary of our performance by end market for 2018. Rafael will then review profitability, capital management results and the outlook. We'll then open the call for Q&A.
Starting with the high-level summary of our fourth quarter financial results; the weakness in demand for our products that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. The weakness was across most markets and came in about as we expected. There were a few exceptions that I'll cover in more detail when I discuss our fourth quarter segment and end market performance.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 4% and Analog Processing declined 12% compared with the same quarter a year ago; both businesses growth decelerated. Operating margin decreased in both businesses, and similar to the third quarter, Embedded remained weaker than Analog, primarily because Analog benefited from increasing content in 5G, while the weaknesses in other markets became more pronounced in Embedded. It is not unusual for Analog and Embedded to perform differently in the short-term, but they are more consistent in the long term.
Earnings per share were $1.27, including a $0.01 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. As we note each quarter, we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $6.1 billion, up 30% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 38.4% of revenue, up from 31.2% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300mm Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2018, we returned $7.7 billion in cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
Moving on, I'll now provide some details of the fourth quarter by segment and end market and offer some additional color on the market. From a year ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 4% due to Signal Chain and Power, partially offset by declines in High Volume. Embedded Processing revenue declined 12% from the year ago quarter due to declines in both product lines; Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our other segment, revenue declined $31 million from the year ago quarter. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded grew 9% and 2%, respectively, and combined were 91% of TI's revenue.
Now, given the current market environment I want to provide some additional color on the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the weakness in demand and our products that began in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. Demand came in mostly as expected, although personal electronics, and specifically smartphones, was weaker, including Chinese smartphone manufacturers. Automotive and industrial, both declined sequentially but still grew single digits from the year ago quarter. In contrast, communications equipment grew about 20% year-on-year, benefiting from 5G deployments.
On a regional basis, demand in China was weaker than the other regions. End markets within China behaved directionally consistent with the rest of the world. We are seeing signs from our customers and the channel that this weakness is primarily from increased caution due to trade tensions. We assume that this weakness is a combination of lower local end demand, as well as reduced exports, but we do not have visibility into distinguish between the two. In addition, I would note that distributors, particularly in Asia, did get more conservative on their inventory positions late in the quarter.
Finally, as we do at the close of each calendar year, I'll now describe our revenue by end market for 2018, which is a good indicator of our strategic progress. We break this into six categories: industrial, automotive, personal electronics which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets, and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems, and other, which is primarily calculators. In summary; industrial, automotive and enterprise systems each grew double digits, while communications equipment was about even and personal electronics declined low single digits in 2018. Specifically, as a percentage of revenue, industrial was 36% and automotive was 20%. Personal electronics was 23%, comms equipment and enterprise systems were 11% and 7%, respectively. Other was 3% of revenue, down low-single digits.
One of our competitive advantages is diversity and longevity. For 2018, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue. We continue our efforts to diversify our growth across products, markets and customers, strengthening this competitive advantage. We continue to focus our strategy on industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
In 2018, industrial and automotive combined made up 56% of TI's revenue, up from 54% in 2017, and up from 42% just five years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, and we see great opportunity ahead.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.41 billion, or 64.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $814 million. Operating expenses for the year were up 1% and were 20.5% of revenue, within our range of expectations. For the year, we have invested $1.56 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter, and then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.52 billion, or 40.8% of revenue. Operating profit was down 3% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.7%, and for Embedded Processing was 29.6%. Our focused investments under best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth overtime.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.24 billion, or $1.27 per share, which included a $0.01 cent discrete tax benefit not in our prior outlook, as we have discussed. As a reminder, the year ago quarter included non-cash charges associated with the tax law changes. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.
Cash flow from operations was $2.15 billion in the quarter, up 11% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $323 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $736 million in dividends and repurchased $2.01 billion of our own stock for a total return to owners of $2.75 billion in the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.23 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt was $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.77%.
Inventory days were 152, up 18 days from a year ago, and above our targeted range as mentioned on our last call. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. We have reduced our operating plan starting in the fourth quarter, but we are also working to replenish inventory of low volume devices; these actions have served us well in the past. In addition, we have made progress on our next phase of our consignment programs with our distributors. We expect inventory will continue to run above our targeted range for several more quarters.
Now, let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2018, cash flow from operations was $7.19 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.13 billion, or 7.2% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2018 was $6.06 billion, or 38.4% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all our free cash flow to owners.
Total cash returned to owners in 2018 was $7.66 billion. These combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. In 2018, we paid $2.56 billion in dividends, or about 42% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.9% in 2018, and has been reduced by 45% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count.
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter; we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.21, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. For 2019 our annual operating tax rate remains unchanged from our prior expectation of 16%. As usual, details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our IR website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, we believe that after 10 quarters of year-on-year growth, the weakness we are seeing is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. In addition, the macro environment, including uncertainty caused by trade tensions, could impact the depth and duration of this cycle. Given our experience, we will stay focused on making TI stronger for the long-term, while remaining diligent in the short-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology and manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived positions [ph]. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products; Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets; industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as any of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
"
2019-01-23,Q&A," Session
Operator
We will take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya
I'm curious, how are you managing your utilization in this downturn that you are seeing? I know Rafael, you mentioned that you have long-lived parts but how are you managing utilization? And are you making any distinction by the end-market that the specific part is going into? And as part of that, should we continue to assume the same 75% or so incremental gross margin fall-through?
Rafael Lizardi
So let me answer the last one first, yes. And now let me go back to your question. So as I -- there is a bit of an echo on the call, but as I -- as we talked a lot on the call 90 days ago, we have reduced our wafer starts to align our operating plan better with our revenue expectations; we did that in fourth quarter, and we are doing that again in the first quarter. That does drive lower factory loadings, and that does have a P&L effect but the way we're thinking about it is as an owner, is from a cash standpoint. So inventory is a use of cash, as we drive down inventory that actually helps cash. And more importantly, it sets us up to support our revenue expectations for the coming year. As to revenue expectations, those revenue expectations change overtime, then we'll adjust the factory loadings and utilization in order to manage that appropriately.
Dave Pahl
And I'll just add to the second part of your question; we've got tens of thousands of products across 100,000 customers, so you can imagine the complexity of that planning. The strongest signal that we get is the orders from customers, as well as the demand signals that we get through our consignment programs. So as we go through and planned wafer starts, that is -- that's what we pay close attention to. And obviously in a time like this, we'll be very diligent in watching that, and then proactively moving when we need to. So with that, do you have a follow-up Vivek?
Vivek Arya
So the second part is, I know you mentioned that it's hard to predict when we come out of this downturn. But are there any other signs that you look at, even if there are qualitative, that can give us some indication whether this is a one or two or three quarter issue? I understand it's very trade dependent but have you seen cancellations that are any different or similar to prior downturns? Any other color that you could help -- that you could give us to help us try and at least predict somewhat when we come out of this would be very useful. Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Yes Vivek, so maybe just a couple of things. I think when we look at different things that we can look at like cancellations, they were up in the quarter, but just up a little. Lead times, overall, they continue to be stable. We can always find pockets where we're working aggressively with customers to close but by and far, they tend to be very stable. So we'll look at all of those signals. I think on the broader view, I've been in the industry for over 30 years now, and we looked at data over that period of time, and I've been through 9 up cycles, and obviously, we're entering into the ninth down cycle. And if you stare at the data, and I've seen in your reports, Vivek, that you've done some analysis on that too, there is no typical or average to those numbers but if you had to pick a number it's probably around the 12 months that a cycle could last. And things like that trade tensions could lengthen that, but it doesn't mean it has to be that long; as you know, it could be longer or shorter than that.
So again, the best signal that we get is those orders from customers. Rafael, you want to add to that?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, just to add to that, we are proactively setting the operating plan so that we can manage whatever comes at us. So it's at a level that if we can run sideways for a while, we are prepared to support our potential snapback. Or if it's deeper and longer, then we have to make further adjustments but we are in a good position to make those adjustments and protect the cash flow and have the company in a position going forward.
Operator
We'll move to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Just Rafael, going back to kind of utilization and inventory; I know you said in your prepared comments, you'll be above sort of your inventory targets for next several quarters. I'm just kind of curious relative to how you see the world today and what action you've already taken on utilization? Do you think 152 days will represent kind of the peak in inventory days or would you expect it to migrate to higher before migrating lower? And I guess as you answer the question, if you could just remind us with the consignment plan, kind of -- what are the new targets for inventory longer term?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, so that's a good question, let me just give you a few things to think about on that. First, as I said before, at the end of the day our objective here is to maximize long-term growth of free cash flow, so that's how we think about all these norms [ph]. Loadings and inventory is one of them, CapEx is another one, that all we're doing is trying to maximize that long-term growth. With inventory, as we say, we see value in owning that inventory, that's part of the reason why we are building that low volume, those low-volume buffer that we talked about is also the reason why we are increasing the consignment inventory. And that does push -- put upward pressure on inventory. At the same time, we -- overall we have lowered the operating plan, so that is to control the cash that's used for inventory, more or so than any particular inventory days target.
Now to get to the heart of your specific question, it depends, right. So if this thing gets weaker, then inventory days could theoretically go up higher than 152. If it stays above stable, then over one, two or three quarters, we'll get back to the insider range.
John Pitzer
Then Dave, as a follow-up, you talked about sort of -- there has been times where discrepancy in growth between Analog and Embedded; I'm wondering if you could just help us understand kind of from an end market perspective, where the discrepancy is sort of the largest? For example; I know in the comm space, there is a really good content story on the Analog side that might not be there on the Embedded side. So when you look at the difference of growth rates, is there any sort of end market color you can give us?
Dave Pahl
Yes, and certainly, both of those segments do have different end market exposure. We talked about the benefits that Analog is staying in comms equipment. You know, most of our PE revenues in Analog is well, so that's the difference, we do have some inside of Embedded. But -- and John, if you look at year-over-year growth rates for as long as we've had the segments out there, you'll notice in times that they are actually moving in opposite directions but overtime, if you look at those numbers, they really do perform more similar. And then, also if you look at just industry data for the Analog market and compare that to the Embedded market, those behave differently. So I think that that's just kind of the facts of how those two businesses behave. Thank you, we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We'll move next to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur
What was the book-to-bill in the December quarter? And near-term, kind of looking at bookings and the rolling forecast on your direct and consignment base customers, have you guys seen any signs of stabilization or do the near-term trends still suggests kind of continued weakness along the same sort of the slope?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So our book-to-bill, and I always make this comment whenever it's asked, we've got now 65% of our revenues on some type of a consignment program, so you're seeing that number begin to move up as we implement further stages of our consignment programs with distributors; so book-to-bill is somewhat you just have to be cautious with the number. But this past quarter it was 0.98, it was 0.98 a year ago and 0.96 in the last quarter; so that's just what the facts are. I think if you look at things like order linearity, orders decreased each month of the quarter. To some degree, that's not completely unusual that in a fourth quarter that you'd see weakness as you got into the third month. But I'd just say that those orders and the demand feeds that we get from our customers has really driven us to give you the guidance that we have; so that's really where we are Harlan. You have a follow-on?
Harlan Sur
Yes. Given the growth this year, you guys drove another $1 billion of Analog revenues to your 300-millimeter fabs, you've got probably about $3 billion left to go. So, if I assume kind of high-single digits type of normalized revenue growth for Analog, your 300-millimeter fabs are going to be full in about 1.5 years. So it would seem that that the team would be having to make a decision soon about your new fab expansion initiatives. So you guys have any updates there?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, let me give you my view, and then Dave may go ahead and chime in. But capacity planning for new 300-millimeter tranche of capacity, that's something we've got to take very seriously, and something that has a very long-term horizon. So this is something that is not changed by small fluctuations in short-term expectations, so we are continuing the planning process on that and right now we have options to consider and we'll continue thinking of that. As we have said, I think 90 days ago, whenever we do decide to go that route, if we do build our factory, that'd probably be a $600 million to $700 million cost on the shell, the actual building, and that will probably spend over a couple of years. So that's not the only option we have for -- to expand capacity, we can always buy an existing factory and that's another option that we're considering. And also I would say, the -- if we do build a factory, there are multiple locations that we're considering.
Dave Pahl
And I'd just add Harlan; that last year we had about $4.8 billion of our Analog revenue on 300-millimeter footprint, that was up from about $4 billion, that's real close to what the Analog segment actually grew. So again, we plan to talk about as Analog would grow, that it would be 300-millimeter that would support the growth. And roughly, that's what we've seen again this quarter.
Operator
We'll take Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Chris Danely
Dave, first of all, congratulations on surviving 8 downturns. Can you guys talk about the ability to manage CapEx and OpEx this year if this sluggish time period continues? Could you work OpEx down on a year-over-year basis? And then, I think you said CapEx was 7.2% of sales or something like that; what should we be thinking about CapEx as a percent of sales this year?
Dave Pahl
Let me give you some background there. First, as I mentioned earlier on the call, all the knobs that we have at the end of the day are to optimize and maximize long-term growth of free cash flow per share; so that's the main objective, as you know very well from knowing us for many years and our capital management strategy. So CapEx is one of those knobs, and for CapEx specifically, what is the objective, it's to invest and support in new technology development, it's revenue growth and to expand our low-cost manufacturing advantage. So in 2018, we spent $1.1 billion for CapEx and as you pointed out, that was 7.2% of revenue. At the same thing, we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow, that was 30% growth on free cash flow from the previous years. So despite that CapEx, we increased free cash flow, that 30%. Now that CapEx is positioning us to grow the top line and free cash flow for a long time to come.
Now given, as you pointed out and as our midpoint and our range implies, decelerating market, then we can do things differently on CapEx. Going forward, I expect -- if conditions continue, a slowdown in CapEx, probably not in the first quarter, maybe not even in the second quarter, but over 2019. We'll just keep that in mind -- keep in mind that is all dependent on expectations of growth beyond that for years, not just 2019 or even 2020. So we'll adjust those -- we'll adjust the CapEx plan as those expectations change.
Rafael Lizardi
And I'd just add; I think when you look at 2019, that we'd expect CapEx to run into the future even beyond 2019, closer to 6% of revenue. And that's higher than what it's been in the past just because of the availability of -- use the 300-millimeter equipment on the market, so that's where our expectations there are. You have a follow-on, Chris?
Chris Danely
Yes. Can you guys just talk about how the slowdown is impacting your two biggest end markets, industrial and automotive?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think that when we look at them, they both slowed in the quarter. We actually saw industrial; it was really broad-based growth on -- from a year-on-year basis, it was double digits but inside of the quarter, it actually grew upper single digits. And then automotive again, it had slowed, but it grew double digits in total for the year but for the quarter, for year-on-year quarter it grew in low-single digits. So again, both of those markets are growing but certainly not at the rates that we have seen over the past few years.
Okay, thank you, Chris. And we'll go to our next caller, please.
Operator
Thank you. That will be from Timothy [ph] from UBS.
Unidentified Analyst
Dave, can you give us an idea of OpEx for March? I know it's typically up like 5% seasonally, but it's also a little more fixed now than in the past. So is it going to be up a smidge [ph], both year-over-year and on a quarterly basis? Thanks.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, so I'll go ahead and take that. First, step back real quick, OpEx is just another knob that we have to optimize long-term growth of free cash flow per share, right; at the end of the day, that is the long-term objective. And in the case of OpEx, it's an opportunity to invest in R&D, so to put more products for industrial and automotive is an opportunity to invest in demand creation on the SG&A side and other things, other initiatives that's going to strengthen our competitive advantages. If you look at 2018, that OpEx came in at about 1% growth versus the previous year and 20.5% of revenue. On a go-forward basis for 2019, for dollars of OpEx, I would expect somewhere in the neighborhood, maybe up a couple of percentage points for pay and benefit increases, something along those lines. But generally speaking, at about that same level, all OpEx.
Now you asked specifically about the quarter, we give you a range for revenue, a range for EPS; we don't get in the lines between, but I will tell you we're not expecting anything unusual. You can look at the fall-through -- expected fall-through on revenue to GPM [ph] and do your own models, and you should get to a reasonable assumption or conclusion for those lines in between.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow-on?
Unidentified Analyst
I do, actually. So Rafael, the Repo [ph] was the biggest in -- as a percent of free cash flow, I'm thinking about 3 years. I know that you don't think of it that way on kind of a quarterly basis but it's historically been a little more mechanical than opportunistic. So should we kind of read into that that you were a little more opportunistic because of the stock pullback? Thanks.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, thanks for the question. So, again, let me step back and remind everybody, what's our intent when it comes to repurchases; and our intent is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company and that objective has not changed. We do that through a combination of dividends and buybacks, and we will be -- we have been and will be opportunistic with repurchases as it makes sense. So for example, in 2018, as I mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was $6.1 billion, that was an increase of 30% from the previous year. And we'd return $7.7 billion throughout the year through a combination of dividends and buybacks. And that year-on-year free cash flow growth was the biggest driver of that increase in returns, as a $6.1 billion increase from $4.7 billion in the previous year.
Dave Pahl
Okay, great. We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
That will be from Chris [ph] with Raymond James.
Unidentified Analyst
First question, I wondered if you can talk about geographic differences. And you mentioned China in your opening remarks, and I think that's obvious right now. Maybe what did you see there and contrast that with what you saw in the U.S. and Europe; was that weak also, just perhaps not as weak as China business?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, that's exactly right, Chris. So when we looked at China, it was weaker than the other regions. And then when you drop down into the end markets within China, I just described it as really performing very similarly, directionally, meaning that comms equipment was up as it was in other areas, we saw the markets of auto and industrial, as well as enterprise get weaker from that standpoint; so we did see that difference this quarter. You have a follow-on?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. And I guess, you would also mentioned in your remarks the impact of the trade issues and tariffs. And obviously, it's very hard to disassociate that from what's going on in the end markets. But with that, have you also seen -- I guess we've heard this from some others that perhaps there was some activity of either pulling forward orders to get ahead of tariffs, or pushing out things because of the tariffs; and obviously, the deadlines have changed and we've got another deadline coming up. I guess the question is what effect it may have had on order patterns as we went through the quarter?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think it's hard for us to actually distinguish that specifically. But the one thing that we did see was, distributors did get more cautious on their inventory late in the quarter. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks; I think that kind of coupled with the signs of weakness that we saw in China, that's really led us to the belief that that's part of the caution that they are seeing from a trade tension standpoint. So -- okay, thank you, Chris and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Thank you. That will be from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst
This is Jerry [ph] on behalf of Ross. I just have a quick question on -- you mentioned consignment transition; is there -- could you quantify an impact to the 1Q '19 guide and 2019 as a whole [ph]?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I'd say that we saw probably about $50 million impact in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter -- Rafael, you can remind me, it's about $20 million or $30 million…
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, in the third quarter.
Dave Pahl
In the third quarter of 2018. We'd expect as we go through next year that that impacted to be about in that range. And by the end of the year, we should have that next phase fully deployed. You have a follow-on?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, there has been some questions about end markets; I just want to ask in a different way. Could you just talk about quarter-on-quarter what the end market did, specifically focusing on the fourth quarter?
Dave Pahl
Certainly. So industrial declined upper single digits, I'd just say those declines were broad-based. Automotive declined upper single digits with all sectors decreasing, personal electronics declined low double digits, comms equipment grew single digits, and enterprise systems declined. So with that, I think we have time for one more caller.
Operator
And that will be from Amit [ph] with RBC Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst
I guess two questions from me as well. I mean, first off, when I look at the March quarter guide and the implication is revenues will decline from 1% in December year-over-year to about 8% in March. What is driving that acceleration in revenue declines? Is there a couple of end markets you would specifically call out that's driving it where perhaps the challenge was adjusting [ph] aggressively or is it more or less broad-based?
Dave Pahl
Amit, when we give our guidance we don't do it by end markets unless there is something specific that is going on that kind of would be discontinuous with how things are operating. So we'll finish up the quarter and let that -- it will provide the details by end markets then. But clearly, the weakness that we saw in the third quarter continued into the fourth. Obviously, that -- we're continuing to expect that to continue into first.
Rafael Lizardi
And just to add to that, as we've said in prepared remarks and during the call; we think this weakness is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle. We've grown for third quarter in a row [ph], and that's the sort of thing that happens in the semiconductor industry. And in addition to that, the macro environment, including the trade tensions could also be having an impact and could affect that and the duration of [indiscernible].
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-on, Amit?
Unidentified Analyst
I do. In the past, best you have talked about your ability to keep picking up 30, 40, 50 -- 30 to 40 basis points a share across your end markets. As you look at '19 where revenue or broader industry trends are somewhat more challenging, is it easier for larger analog company to pick up more market share or is it more difficult for you guys? How would you kind of stack that up?
Dave Pahl
I think when you look at the quality of the opportunity in the Analog and Embedded space, if market share just doesn't move quickly across any of our peers in these marketplaces; and I think that just really speaks to the quality of that opportunity. So we continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are our manufacturing and technology we talked about earlier, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels which includes our sales force and the size of it but also our presence at TI.com, and then diversity and longevity. So we're not dependent on any particular customer or product or technology to drive that revenue. So we're working and investing to make those stronger, it's just hard to pick up market share; I can tell you that everyone here at TI will be focused on that even as we go through the downturn, and probably have even more diligence and intensity around that overall. But again, if you could make that number higher, we absolutely would, but it is a hard thing to move.
So with that, let me turn it over to Rafael to add some final comments.
Rafael Lizardi
All right. So let me finish with a few comments on some key items for you to remember. First, during this period of weaker demand, we will stay focused on what will make us stronger long-term and diligent in the short-term. Second, we will remain focused on the Analog and Embedded, the best products, and Industrial and Automotive, the best markets. Third, we will continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning all free cash flow to the owners of the company.
Dave Pahl
Okay, thank you for joining us. Again, please plan to join us for our Capital Management call on February 5 at 10 AM Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

That does conclude our conference call for today, everyone. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Executives
Rafael Lizardi - CFO
Dave Pahl - IR
Analysts
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
John Pitzer
The morning session fireside chat with Texas Instruments. My name is John Pitzer, I’m the semiconductor analyst here at Credit Suisse. It’s my pleasure to introduce to my immediate left, Rafael Lizardi. He’s the Chief Financial Officer of Texas Instruments and to his left, Dave Pahl, who runs Investor Relations. We’ve got about 20, 25 minutes in this setting. If you do have a question, please raise your hand. We do have a couple of mics floating around and we’ll be happy to entertain questions from the audience, but first Rafael, Dave, appreciate the time this morning.
 Rafael Lizardi
Yeah. Good morning. Thanks.
John Pitzer
Maybe, I’ll kick things off. I hate the near term aspect of this question, but every three or four years, this conference gets dominated by sort of the health of the industry cycle questions. And you guys were relatively early in the reporting cycle for the calendar third quarter and the bullish conspiracy theory is that you reported ahead of a lot of your peers and when your peers reported, they actually saw some relative stability in the bookings backlog of their business, which is why you guys guided the way you did, perhaps a little bit more conservative than some of your peers. The question I have is, how are you characterizing the current environment. On the conference call, you said this was a semiconductor downturn, not a macro event, and I think that led to some confusion around investors. What’s the message you’re trying to give about the near term?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah. So let me frame it for you, we’re clearly seeing deceleration. So over the last couple of years, at our company level, certainly in our focus areas of analog and embedded processing, we’ve seen double digit growth and that is above the trend line. So at some point, that means that there's inventory being built in parts of the chain, not directly in front of us, because largely 60 some percent of our revenues on consignment, but somewhere in the chain. So at some point, that’s correct. 
We did not say that it was not macro. We said that it could be, macro could be having an influence and clearly and you read about it in the newspaper and you hear in various sources that there are some areas of the world that are decelerating from a macro standpoint. So could that be playing a factor? Yes. But for us, we just wanted to report on what our customers’ -- the orders that they are sending us, the pull rate and just based on that, we are clearly seeing a deceleration that was there. So, we reported. 
The other thing I wanted to mention, you said something about conservative guidance. Our guidance is not conservative. Our guidance is what we believe and there is a range for a reason and there's a midpoint for a reason.
John Pitzer
Do you buy into the bullish conspiracy theory that you went earlier and therefore you had less information as you gave guidance.
Dave Pahl
No. Yeah. And, John, as you know, our guidance is based on the orders we get from customers. So the demand that they tell us they want us to ship to them in fourth quarter and 60% of that is on consignment, right. So we get direct feeds from their planning system into ours and the guidance is based off of that.
John Pitzer
The other thing that I think investors really keyed off of -- off of the earnings call was the commentary that perhaps this current correction could be more severe than what we saw in ‘15 and ’13. To me, it sounds like your argument is the growth leading up to this sort of top was stronger than 15, 13 and so what goes up, must come down, if it goes up more, it probably needs to come down more. I understand that, but I would also argue that there's probably a stronger content story going on in semis today or content growth story going on in semis today than ’15, ’13. So maybe I'll give you just the opportunity to explain a little bit more detail kind of what you were trying to articulate with that commentary on the call.
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah. John, I'll start and Dave, you chime in. I believe I recently looked at a 30-year analysis of the semiconductor less memory and ups and downs during that time. Frankly, I don't think you can draw any hard conclusions and I know that. There is just every slow that has been different, the upturns have been different. So with that, the last two have lasted about a couple of years or so, the upturn and the downturn, a slowdown is less than about a year. So take those 2 and maybe you can draw some conclusions.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. And just to clarify, what the analysis we're looking at was monthly data, 3 year moving average, but it was monthly and it was year-on-year. So, I know, a lot of people look at it sequentially and you will get a different set of numbers, but that’s what we’ve meant that. And just to add to that, John. Someone asked me the question of what's different today than back in ’15. And I made the observation that revenues grew stronger in to the cycle. I stopped at making the conclusion that therefore it had to correct stronger. It might. Obviously, we just don't know that as a fact. So we’ll get more insight into that as the quarters go by.
John Pitzer
And then hopefully my last near term question, but just as you think about the pause we're going through right now, can you differentiate by region, by end market, I had a couple of companies that were -- Electronica over in Germany a couple of weeks ago and except for what's going on with the mission testing in autos, the feedback that I've been getting is that actually the European customer base is pretty positive and pretty upbeat and this really feels more like a China phenomenon than anything else. How would you kind of think about the pause in terms of either geo or product or end markets.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. I think when we look -- of course, we've made the comment before that our regional data is a poor look through to what’s going on in a specific region. Every once in a while, it will be so pronounced that it will pop out in the numbers. We didn’t see anything that in the numbers that would say, hey, it's just one particular region. And if you looked at the charts of the end markets and you can put industrial up there, automotive up there, enterprise and even PE, I’m a little cautious to put PE in, because it is choppy and specific by customer, but they all slowed about at the same rates. Now, they, of course, started at different growth rates and ended at different growth rates, but the rate of that slow looked very similar when you looked at it on the chart. So -- and then underneath that, within sight of industrial as an example of what that slowdown wasn’t driven by one or two of the 14 sectors is pretty consistent across the board.
Rafael Lizardi
I want to connect some things earlier on the content growth and you mentioned it in reference to the cycle, but I want to connect that to the longer term secular trends that we're seeing in auto and industrial and that is where the content growth is happening. That's why the sort of two end markets that we’re focusing our investment. And, we know it is easy to think about, we all drive cars. We are seeing them, we know how they're improving, the electronics are going into that for safety reasons, for all kinds of things, the movement to electric vehicles that clearly that adds more semiconductor to cars. So clearly, that's a big driver. Industrial, if you get more exciting. 
And industrial, we see some of that in our houses and buildings that we work, different places, but a lot of the content growth is happening in places that we don't see, in factories, medical, defense, aerospace. We've broken down that end market in 14 sectors and each of those is broken down in equipment and there's hundreds of them and the content growth that’s happening there is incredible and our portfolio is very well suited for that. We have signal change, we have power, we have connectivity, all of that is needed to connect all these machines to each other and to humans.
John Pitzer
Over the last several years, the fundamental strategy for the company has been to optimize free cash flow growth and then to return any excess cash back to shareholders in the form of a dividend or a buyback. I think I’ve actually memorized that line from your conference call. That's a -- there's a lot of inputs that go into optimizing free cash flow. There's revenue growth, there's margin. When you look at the last several years, I think one of the concerns investors have is you have a tailwind on the margin front, you had done a tremendous job bringing up your gross margin, tremendous job bringing up your op margin, you’ve kind of had a tailwind of relatively cheap capacity on the CapEx front. 
As we look out over the next 3 to 5 years, what are the elements you think are going to be most important to optimizing that free cash flow growth, because clearly, if you're talking about CapEx probably being above trend, starting in the middle of next year for a couple of years, how do we, as investors, think about those inputs for free cash flow growth.
Rafael Lizardi
Let me start and Dave, you want to chime in.
Dave Pahl
Sure.
Rafael Lizardi
But yes, we do believe free cash flow per share growth is the biggest driver of value to the owners of the company. Okay. And there are others, that’s not the only one, but if I have to pick one, that's the main one. So as you alluded to, over the last several years, we've grown that and at the top of the company, you see outside of the last couple of years, you see our revenue was relatively flat, because legacy wireless was decreasing, but in spite of that, Analog and Embedded have been growing pretty consistently for 10 years now. In fact, the CAGR 15 years, so the CAGR for 10 year and 5 year growth is about 8% in both of those comparisons. 
So it’s M&A independent, because one of those comparisons includes the national acquisition and the other one, it was already embedded. So, that has been happening. There's no reason why that shouldn’t continue to happen. Right? So that is to get to your question and on a go forward basis, that's the number one driver. Right? We want to -- we need to grow revenue, but we have shown that we can do that with analog and embedded, and specifically from an end market standpoint, auto and industrial, as I mentioned over there.
The other one is margin. Margin, is not the driver for value. Okay. I know a lot of people like GPM and this is a big deal. But that's not the driver for value, right, the driver for value is dollars of free cash flow. But generally speaking, we do see that there are more tailwinds than headwinds on GPM, everything else being equal. Now that’s not the same as 3 or 4 or 5 years ago, but there are still more of those. The other one is OpEx discipline, which we have and we will continue to do that, to keep that tight. That doesn't mean we're going to decrease it, but can we increase that a little less than revenue? Of course.
The last one is what we do with that free cash flow. Right? And that is very important. So I said, free cash flow generation per share is the number one metric. Maybe, the number two metric is the return of that free cash flow and because two companies can do the same thing on generating, but one returns and the other one does frivolous things without free cash, when you are going to get very different results. So we return all free cash flow to the owners of the company, about half of that with dividends, about half of that on buybacks. So there are more buybacks that we do, we lower that denominator, so then that also adds a little bit of juice to our free cash flow per share growth.
John Pitzer
It sounds like though that your expectation for the core businesses of analog and embedded growth isn't really that different from what it has been historically. I'm kind of curious, given the content story, shouldn't we see faster revenue growth and at what point, if ever, the scale really begin to matter in these businesses where customers are going to be forced to deal with fewer suppliers who can do more and if that trend becomes predominant, aren't you sitting sort of in the capital seat?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Maybe I'll start and you can add in Rafael. I think, there are many natural competitive modes around both the analog business as well as the embedded business. We've got four competitive advantages taken together we think make us unique and you’ve heard us talk about them before. Our manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, so we can just engage with more customers and when we do engage with more customers, we just got more categories of products to sell. So we can just get more sockets or more dollars per engagement when we do engage. 
That drives more people to our website, which is the reach of our channel as well as it allows us to afford a larger sales and apps for us, so we can go and call on more customers directly and go deeper into the larger customers. And then the fourth one is diversity and longevity. So diversity means we're not dependent on any one smartphone cycle or any one technology like 5G or level 4 driverless cars to drive revenue. We’ll benefit from those things, but we’re not dependent singularly on any one of those. So we've been investing and we've Rafael, a dozen initiatives at the company that we've been working on. Some have graduated. We’ve added new ones to that mix over the time. 
But things like, you've heard us use the words of owning and controlling our inventory we think is a strategic value to us as well. Why is that? Well, that's part of that reach of market channels and trying to develop a closer more direct relationship with our customers. We've got other initiatives that are strengthening that competitive advantage. So when you look at it and you make the comment, geez, it looks like all those things are getting stronger, the traffic over our website, the size of that portfolio continues to improve. 
It's hard to know for sure what that's going to translate into in the market share gains and that's because there's a lot of those natural competitive modes that sit around. So we've gained 30, 40 basis points of share a year when you look back 5, 10 and probably even 15 years. So we have confidence that we could probably do that again for the next few years. I think our confidence is pretty high. Could it be better? It could be, but we don't have any data that tells us that absolutely no, it would be.
John Pitzer
I will give you one anecdotal data point. When I look at suppliers of semis into autos, of the top 5, I think you're the only one that actually outgrew the market over the last three years and to me, this idea of customers being forced to deal with fewer suppliers who can do more, the auto vertical seems like the most apparent one where that trend is going to materialize. So why can't I use that analog to other parts of your business?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. I’d just be careful with it. It is all I think that there are natural competitive modes, what’s the famous saying that you can define good quality opportunities, you can even run them poorly for a long time and they will do well. So making progress is just not something that's easy to do, doesn't happen quickly, but if you're consistent and execute well, those small changes will become very large over time.
Rafael Lizardi
I rather come to point after I go through the whole, not before.
John Pitzer
Rafael, back on the op margin, there's a gap between analog op margins and embedded op margins and you've done a good job growing both, but how do we think about that gap longer term? Is embedded just a higher OpEx business or should we start to see convergence towards the higher end in the embedded business?
Rafael Lizardi
Frankly, so we get that question from time to time. The goal is not to equate those. It goes to generate more free cash flow and free cash flow per shares I talked about earlier. We can do that, we’ve embedded at 30 some percent margin versus the 40 some percent margin and we do that and we just optimize for the dollars that we get.
John Pitzer
And then I think the other thing is there is a lot of unique things about Texas Instruments model. To me, one of the ones that stand out is just your R&D burden as a percent of revenue and how it compares to the rest of the industry. You guys used to get the question of, are you spending enough.
Rafael Lizardi
Or you’re not spending enough.
John Pitzer
Yeah. You’re not spending enough. I’m going to actually turn that on to the head. I think one of the strengths of your business is that you can maintain your franchise value at a lower sort of OpEx R&D burden. And I actually think investors are willing to pay up for that, which is one of the reasons why I think industrials trade at a higher multiple to semis. If you kind of think about that R&D burden today, are you willing to let that continue to glide down or do you feel like 10% sort of the proper range relative to your growth aspirations?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah. I would tell you that it’s a bit of a misnomer to look at it that way. It’s not how we think about it, because the percent -- you're comparing today’s R&D to today’s revenue. That frankly makes no sense. Right, I mean that’s how we show in the P&L, but today’s R&D is compared to the revenue three or four years from now, in some cases, even longer than that, right. So we look at that like from a return on investment standpoint. If I get put an extra $10 million on a particular analog project, that is going to yield $200 million and most of the dollars we have frankly, that you can just make it up on a spreadsheet and justify anything. 
But if you can get comfortable that there is a technology that you're number one or number two, that is a set of products that are going to sell not to one or two customers, but are going to sell to 10, 15, 20 customers that its products that are going to go into industrial, into factory automation, building automation where you do see the content growth happening. Then that gives you a level of comfort beyond whatever spread to it would say, right. So that's how we think about it.
The other comment I'll give you is that there is scale advantages, there are scale advantages in R&D, because there are, in analog in particular, because there are some expenses that you need to have at a certain level, no matter how big you are, right. There is packaging technology that you have to develop, there is processing technology that you have to develop, even if you are using founders, which some our competitors do. So then that favors us, because we both have about the same amount of dollars than on a revenue base.
John Pitzer
Any questions from the audience?
"
2018-11-27,Q&A," Session
Q - Unidentified Analyst
[indiscernible]
Dave Pahl
Yeah. For the webcast, the question was, on the call, we weren't specific of regional weakness, but since time has gone on, it looks like China has weakened. So when we're asked the question, what we do is, we look at the data that we've got from our sales and where we're shipping product. And I usually make a comment that that's a very bad proxy for what's going on in a region. Every once in a while, it's strong enough that it will pop out, but we may ship a product and I use, we may ship a product to an auto tier 1 in Indiana that then gets put into a BMW in Germany, that then gets put on a ship and sold in to Beijing. 
And you have a slowdown in Beijing that shows up in our order book as a slowdown in Indiana. So we don't have a way to track where that revenue goes and just as a lot of the revenue we ship into China ends up shipping into other regions around the world. So what I can tell you as when we looked at the data last quarter, there was not a specific region that jumped out. I think I read the same headlines in reports that you do a slowing in China. Is that in the order book? Absolutely. We won’t escape that either, right, but what we can see directly is what we talk about.
Unidentified Analyst
I had a question on your new 12-inch fab. Do you have a timing for when you expect to ramp that fab up. And when you look at the profitability, how do you see the greenfield capacity margin versus existing business. And also, do you expect a period it will take to get up to scale where we could get less incremental gross margin than we've seen in the past few years?
Rafael Lizardi
Okay. So let me take the first shot and that has a multi question -- questions. I forget some of them, but at a high level, we probably do 15.8 or so billion dollars of revenue this year and our overall capacity, if you look at what we said on 300 millimeter specifically, you should come up with about 18.5 billion or so. So that leaves almost $3 billion with the existing infrastructure that we can continue growing. Now, if you didn't take the 15.8 and project it forward, at some point, we run out of capacity, right, and that could be, depending on what assumption you make between, we’ve used 2% to 8%. If you do 8%, we will run out in the back half of 2020. At 2%, we run out in 2024. 
But either way, at some point, we run out. So we have been and will continue to look for options to increase that capacity and this is specifically 300 millimeter wafer capacity, which is significantly less expensive, 40% less expensive than 200 millimeters. So we think, it's a competitive advantage. We have multiple options to do that. We're still looking at potentially buying an existing factory and have been, but another one is to build a new factory. That could be in various states in the United States or it could be outside of the United States and we're looking at that and we'll give you whatever that we're ready, we will talk about that. 
Now let me tell you some specifics on that factory. So, if we do build a new factory, you don’t build half a factory or a quarter of factory, we have to build the whole thing, right, the entire building. So that would be one kind of discrete expense. It’s probably going to be $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years, because you obviously don’t build it in one year. It takes about a year and a half or so to build. So that will be a discrete expense on that and then after that, you still have equipment more incrementally that is always ahead of demand, but incrementally. 
Now, I think you asked about the returns. This is how we like to think about it. A factory like that, it will cost, all in, building and equipment, $3 billion to $4 billion. And some of that depends, if you buy the factory from somebody else and you have to equip it or you build a building and you have to put most of that equipment new, so that would be on the $4 billion, the previous case, on the $3 billion side. But once that is fully equipped, that can generate $5 billion of revenue per year for 20 to 30 years at 80% plus of fall through of cash fall through margin, right. Do the math on that. That is a huge return, whether you put 3 billion or 4 billion on the spreadsheet, on the investment, you’re still going to get a really good return. So that is the power of 300 millimeter for analog specifically, because the digital would be a very different story because you wouldn’t be able to run it for 20 to 30 years, but the analog factor, you can run it that long and get a really good return.
John Pitzer
Rafael and Dave, I think it was about this time last year on a conference call that you kind of caused a little bit of controversy around dividend versus buyback and you kind of left the impression that perhaps going forward you get more back in dividend than buy back and then you spent the next couple of quarters actually buying back more stock, then the trend over the last few quarters. As you think about that excess cash, can you talk about dividend versus buyback and maybe also throw in the M&A card, the frequency of M&A has been about every 8 to 10 years, so it’s hard to draw a trend with that frequency, but we're coming up to that 8 to 10 year period.
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah. So on returning cash to investors, so we believe, like I said before, generating free cash flow is the most important thing, maybe the second most important thing is returning to the owners of the company and we do that through dividends and buybacks. And the dividend, 40% to 50% of the free cash flow is our target. We think that's sustainable. And on the trailing 12 month basis, I think we're up 41% or 40%. So plenty of room on that front.
The downside of that, the remaining is buybacks. So for example, over the last 12 months, we have generated 5.9 billion of free cash flow and we have returned through dividends and buybacks, 6.2 billion. So about the same. So -- and some people look at our buybacks in isolation and say, wow, that has increased. Well, it has, but the free cash flow is what really has increased to begin with. So at the highest level, that's the strategy. Can we do a live in more during times where the stock price is depressed? Sure. We can do that. We have done that and we’ll do that. I think that’s created through the owner of the company.
On M&A, I’ll tell you a few things. One, our high level framework is, we only look at analog companies that have catalog products that are focused on industrial and automotive and with differentiated products and only when the price is right. Okay. That's the symbol framework. And it has to pay -- and the price being right, it means that if I spend $100 on day one, within 4 years, I better be getting my cost of capital from a cash flow standpoint. So in my cost of capital, call it 10% for simplicity, by year four, I need to be getting after tax cash of $10 per year every year, right, and then growing. That's a difficult hurdle to achieve, ladies and gentlemen. So we don’t do it very often, but I think that's good for you, as owners of the company, because we’re not expanding your capital.
The other thing to consider with M&A is at the time or frankly for a number of years, since we bought national, we don't have a gap in our portfolio. So this is not -- we're not going out there desperately looking for a match in order to fill some big gap in the portfolio. We consider niche things here and there that augment, but nothing that would meet kind of the strategic portfolio gap definition.
John Pitzer
Great. With that, we've ended our time here, but I want to thank both Rafael and David for joining us today. Appreciate.
Rafael Lizardi
Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Texas Instruments’ Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI’s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I’ll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 4% from a year ago; however, demand for our products slowed across most markets during the
quarter. Earnings per share were $1.58. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 8% and Embedded Processing revenue declined 4% compared with the same quarter a year ago.
Analog and Embedded performed about the same directionally within most end markets, with communications equipment as the exception. In communications equipment, Analog products saw double-digit growth, which included early 5G product ramps, while Embedded products declined from a year ago, as we expected. Without the decline in communications equipment, Embedded would have grown.
With that backdrop, I’ll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be
representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $5.9 billion, up 40% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 37.5% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that’s long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.
For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $6.2 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion, taken together these reflect our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to our owners.
I’ll provide some details by segment. From the year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 8% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue decreased by 4% from the year-ago quarter due to Processors. Connected Microcontrollers was about even. In our Other segment, revenue declined 6% primarily due to custom products, as we expected.
Now, I’ll provide some insight into this quarter’s performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand slowed to upper-single digit growth with most sectors growing year-on-year.
Automotive grew double-digits from a year ago, but the growth slowed from previous quarters. We continue to focus our investments across 14 sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive. We believe these investments will continue to deliver broad-based and diverse revenue growth over the long-term.
Personal electronics declined mid-single digits as increases at some customers were offset by declines at others. Communications equipment increased low-single digits from a year ago as Analog, which included early 5G product ramps I mentioned earlier grew and was offset by declines in Embedded. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. And these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion or 65.8% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 130 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $786 million, about even from a year ago and about as expected.
On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.55 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.
Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.94 billion or 45.5% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 49.8%, up from 47% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 34.6%, down from 34.9% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions will enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth over the long-term. Net income in the third quarter was $1.57 billion or $1.58 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.11 billion in the quarter. It increased $384 million from the year-ago quarter primarily due to a lower tax rate and higher revenue, which includes more 300 millimeter Analog revenue.
Capital expenditures were $370 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.93 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, up 40% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we paid $602 million in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock for a total return of $1.8 billion in the third quarter. We have returned $6.23 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
As Dave mentioned already, in September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24%, and we increased our share repurchase authorizations by $12 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.62 to $0.77, or $3.08 annualized. This is our 15th consecutive year of dividend increases, and over the past 5 years we have increased the quarterly dividend by a compounded average rate of 21%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $18.2 billion at the end of third quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $5.11 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt is $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 131, up 13 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory. In the third quarter, we began the next phase of our consignment program with our distributors and implementation will continue through the end of 2019.
Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.6 billion to
$3.9 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.34. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and about 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to non-cash charges.
To help you with your model for 2019, we are providing the quarterly discrete tax benefits and tax rates for the year. We expect a discrete tax benefit of $20 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters, and $5 million in the fourth. Therefore, the effective tax rate would be 15% for the first quarter and 16% in the second, third and fourth quarters. These details of our expectations for taxes can also be found on the IR website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, the strength of our business model has been demonstrated over the past 15 years through up and down markets. We are heading into a softer market, and we plan to execute as we
have in the past: First, we will be disciplined with our operating plan. We will reduce wafer starts; however, inventory days will rise above our range as we strategically build low-volume, long-lived products and implement the latest phase of our consignment program. Second, we will continue our R&D investment levels and plans, which have a long-term focus. Third, we will be thoughtful with SG&A.
There are important areas of investments that increase our competitive advantages, like our demand-creation initiative, and these would remain unchanged. In other areas of SG&A, we will be prudent as appropriate. And lastly, we are planning our next phase of 300 millimeter capacity expansion to be available as soon as 2020 or 2021. A slowdown will have little effect on our timing to get the next 300 millimeter factory shell in place.
In conclusion, we are focused on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which will enable us to grow free cash flow per share for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys, thank you for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about drivers of gross margin in the next quarter. You mentioned a few things, you’re going to reduce wafer starts but inventory days are also going to rise. You mentioned your 300-millimeter next phase is coming on, which suggests CapEx continues to be elevated so depreciation goes up. I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on the different drivers as we get into Q4 and how should think about those drivers evolving into 2019 and beyond as some of them are longer-term?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, Stacy, let me take that. The big picture of fall-through on our revenue is the same as it has been before. 70% to 75% is what we have talked about and that applies on going up, it also applies going down. So that’s what we would expect. Of course, that is over the long haul. So any one quarter, it could be a little different. The other thing I would tell you, obviously, when we are increasing wafer starts, that is a help for gross margins and when we’re decreasing wafer starts, it’s a headwind on gross margins. And so you will see that and you should expect that. You have a follow-up?
Stacy Rasgon
Yes. So I guess, how do you continue to build inventory going forward if you’re reducing wafer starts? How does that work?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. So it depends on how much you reduce wafer starts depending on the revenue change, right? And also it depends on the timing of that. Wafers cycle times can be anywhere between 12 to 16 weeks. It doesn’t change on a dime. But the key point on keeping those, the wafer starts, at a level that even though we are reducing them, but we can still build those long-lived inventory buffers for industrial and automotive. Those are low risk buffers. Those parts live for a long, long time and they enable us to then support our customers on the other side of this slowdown. So overall, it’s just a better way and a smart way to allocate our capital.
David Pahl
Yes. And I’ll just add to that, Stacy, that not only will we build that strategic inventory of low-volume parts but we’re also, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, moving a larger proportion of our revenues to consignment. So both of those things will put pressure on inventory. But we believe those are the right things to do long term. So thanks, Stacy. We’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We’ll now hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, just relative to your comments in the prepared remarks about Embedded in the comms space, can you help us sort of quantify the size of that business now? And is that at all influencing the guide for the December quarter?
David Pahl
Okay, yes. So let me take you back to our capital management strategy back in February. And if you look back even over the past few years, we’ve been talking about how we’re allocating R&D just through an end market view. So as you walk through that, no surprise that industrial and automotive, we’ve been taking our allocation of R&D up there. In Personal electronics, no surprise there. It’s down, but it’s more selective, it’s not zero. We still find good opportunities. And then comms equipment really has been a different story on Analog than it has been on Embedded. And we’ve long talked about in Embedded that we’ve taken our spend there up. In Analog and Embedded, we’ve actually taken it down.
The reason why is that when you look at 5G, there are what’s new and what operators need and the OEMs that are delivering that new standard creates more complexity in the radio. And for us, that translates to more Analog contents and more opportunity. The new 5G standards really don’t change things much from a digital standpoint. So we’ve got good position there that’s not – that isn’t something that we’ve needed to invest in. So really, what we are seeing is just the result as that rolls out. So we’re confident in our 5G position as that market begins to grow. And we also have a great 4G business and we’re still shipping some 3G stuff.
So we are convinced that the majority of our growth is still going to come longer-term from industrial and automotive. But we’ll – comms equipment will be a very good market for us for long periods of time. Do you have a follow-up, John?
John Pitzer
Dave, I guess my question specifically is, is there another shortfall in revenue coming in Embedded Comms in the calendar fourth quarter? Because it looks like it was at least, on a year-over-year basis, about $40 million in the calendar third quarter, if your comments about Embedded growing ex comms is correct, if I’m doing the math right. Is that – is there more to come in the calendar fourth quarter? Or is this now behind us?
David Pahl
Yes. So last year, comms equipment was 12% of our revenues in total. And I would say that, if you have listened to the commentary, which I’m sure you did, it was the one market that actually grew inside of the quarter, right? So we saw year-on-year growth in communications equipment in total even though that was not contributed by the Embedded business. So yes, those things are in our guidance going forward. I think our guidance is more influenced by the fact that we are seeing most of the markets beginning to slow versus the specifics of what’s going on inside of comms equipment. So thank you, John. We’ll go the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. Chris Danely with Citigroup, please go ahead.
Chris Danely
Hey thanks, guys. Just a little more color maybe on the slowdown. When you talk to your customers or the distis, does it feel like things could get a little bit worse? And then maybe which – it sounds like comms looks a little bit better, which of the end markets has fallen off the most?
David Pahl
Yes, let me start and see if Rafael wants to add anything. So Chris, I think that it’s always best when you enter a period like this. We just kind of stick to the facts of what we can see, what we can measure. We just turned in 4% growth year-over-year. If you take the midpoint of our guidance, revenues would be flat. So that’s a different number than what we’ve just delivered inside of this quarter. So where it goes from there and how long it lasts are just things that we don’t know. We will be in a position with what we’re doing with wafer starts. That if it’s a more shallow correction, we will be prepared to support it on the other side. If it’s longer lived, we will be monitoring our wafer starts on a daily basis and we know how to react in those situations.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, let me add to that and I’ll just frankly just emphasize what Dave say he covered it very well already. But most end markets have slowed, that’s what we know. And we believe this is mostly driven by a slowdown in semiconductors, meaning we really can’t speak to any macro driven event here. As we have said before, the direct effect of the tariffs for us in any of the trade issues is minimal. It’s really not there. So all we can judge is by what we see right in front of us, what our customers, the signal they send us and that’s what we are basing this on.
In addition to that, as Dave said, the key thing here is what we do with the operating plan so that we put ourselves in a position so that if this is shallow, we can very quickly ramp back up and support growth. If it’s not shallow, if it actually goes the other way, we are also in a position where we can make additional adjustments to just continue to do the right thing from a free cash flow standpoint and from an operating plan standpoint. On the investment side, as I said during our prepared remarks, we are not going to change anything on R&D. SG&A will be prudent and then on 300-millimeter, we’re going to continue with the plans to continue expanding that, strengthening the competitive advantage.
David Pahl
Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Chris Danely
Yes. I guess, not talking about the future, but just given what’s happened to you up until now. What would you attribute the cause of the slowdown? Is it just overall demand? Is it tariffs? Is it China? Is it too much inventory? Anything more specific on just the slowdown in semis? What do the customers or disties are telling you, I guess?
David Pahl
Yes, Chris, I think that kind of reiterating what Rafael said and maybe add a little color is that we believe that’s mostly driven by a slowdown in the semiconductor market just after several years of strong growth. It doesn’t preclude that there aren’t other things and other factors, the macro things that are going on. Certainly, as the quarters evolve, those things will become more obvious of what role that they’ll play. But that’s where – we’ll just stick to what we can see and what we know. So all right, thank you, Chris. And we’ll go to the next caller.
Operator
Caller your line is open Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
Hey guys, thanks to let me ask a question. I guess I wanted to hit it from a lead time perspective. David, doesn’t seem like you’re going to give terribly more color on it. But if it’s short lead times and your lead times haven’t really changed, it seems like it would be more of a demand than an inventory perspective. So any color you could give on that? And then maybe even geographically, is there any color about one market acting differently than any of the others?
David Pahl
Yes, Ross. Let me just comment on a few of the things that we can see. And certainly, we watch all those indicators. And to kind of start with where I want to end is the best indicator that we get are orders from customers that we get directly as well as we’ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment where we actually have demand fees that customers are telling us what they plan to build. And those clearly are the best signals that we can see. Our outlook will be built on that. And certainly, those indicators show that demand slowed across most of the end markets during the quarter.
And that’s why you see the guidance as it is, the sentiment that kind of as we are working through things here. So when you look at the other indicators that we see, so things like distributor inventory, it’s up slightly but it’s still running at about four weeks. Cancellations are up, but I would still describe them as running at low levels. Our lead times, as you mentioned, they have continued to remain stable. And it doesn’t matter what period you’re in, you’re always going to have places where demand will be tight and we will work with customers on that. But the vast majority of products have continued to be very, very stable from a lead time standpoint. So that’s kind of what we see. Regionally, I don’t think when we look at our numbers, there’s nothing there that we would call out, specifically. And also, just as a reminder, I know you know very well that we ship product into a particular region, it may get put into a subsystem or a system and then shipped into another region of the world. So actually, looking at our demand by regional results really doesn’t give much color on what’s going on from a macro standpoint. So you got a follow-on?
Ross Seymore
Yes. Just quickly, you haven’t mentioned the automotive market in any short-term fashion. But that’s been the market that probably has the biggest laundry list of headwinds from your customers and your customers’ customers. Any color of what you’re seeing in aggregate or on the five sub segments within it?
David Pahl
Yes. On Automotive, growth did slow there. But as you know, we’ve been growing very strongly and really for five years plus. So demand slowed but it still grew double-digits, right? So we saw that growth was broad-based. It was across the sectors. But in aggregate, it did slow as well as the demand inside of industrial. And so, okay? Well, thank you, Ross. We’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
Joe Moore
Great, thank you. I wonder if you can just – I think just take one more cut at this demand question. I mean, when you guys are guiding for Q4, is the conservatism entirely just what you’re seeing in your order book? And to what degree, when you see these automotive shortfalls at your customers and, to a lesser extent, industrial shortfalls of your customer, are you budgeting for that to maybe soften from where your current level of visibility is? Or is not that the way you’re looking at?
Rafael Lizardi
I’ll just make a quick comment and turn it over to Dave. But I wouldn’t categorize or characterize that guidance as conservative. This is the best we know, based on the orders that we are getting from our customers and the best signal that we have. And that range encompasses the best of our knowledge.
David Pahl
Yes, I think that’s well said. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?
Joe Moore
Yes, sure. I mean, do you have a sense for, when you look at your third quarter, do you think your customers built inventory? And did you see any people building ahead to get ahead of tariffs, either the 10% or the 25% tariff? Just any indications that your inventories may have built and that some element of this is softening? Is inventory declining in Q4? Just how are you thinking about those inventory levels?
David Pahl
Yes. I’ll point out or I’ll just remind you, Joe, because I know you know, we’ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment. So for that revenue, there isn’t an inventory buffer at our customers that are in front of that. The demand that we’re seeing is the actual – is close to the factory order builds as you’re going to get. Our visibility ends there, right? So their demand downstream and downstream into their kennels, of course we have no visibility on that front. So we are fairly early in the announcement schedule and lineup. And so we will find out where that – if there is inventory out there as more companies report. So thank you very much. And we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We’ll go to Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of America – sorry with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Lastly checks to BMO, thank you.
David Pahl
Never know.
Ambrish Srivastava
Never know. I’m sure Vivek is there on the line as well, sorry, Vivek. You’re safe, buddy. So just, Dave, on the demand side, I just wanted to – you guys have been to several sectors. I just wanted to make sure and you’re correctly calling out that you’re telling us what you’re seeing on the fact space. But then these metrics like cancellations or debookings or what have you, is there a rate of change that you look at and say that you can give us any perspective on how deep it’s going to be or what kind of duration this would turn into?
Rafael Lizardi
I’ll take a shot at that. And Dave, you want to add to that. But frankly, no, we – as Dave said, we have – the visibility that we have is to the consignment inventory that’s in front of us. And by the way, that is inventory that is still in our books. So we haven’t recognized revenue for that. So that’s one advantage of having that consignment, that inventory like that. And so that’s the data point we have and we use that to forecast the next quarter’s revenue. And the other data point is what Dave already mentioned, right, cancellations. They’re up slightly but they continue at low levels and our lead times have remained stable.
David Pahl
Yes. And I’ll just say, things like distributor inventory, Ambrish, I’ll point out, it’s still around four weeks. That’s half to a third of what many of our peers run with distributor inventory. And as we implement these next phases, that number structurally will continue to come down over time. So now that doesn’t mean that we’re not going to see cycles in those types of impact. And even with consignment inventory, we have as good a visibility as you can get of what our customers are going to build. But never confuse high visibility with – that, that number can’t change and change quickly. So – but we know about it as soon the customers plan to do something and something different.
Rafael Lizardi
And let me add a little bit to that. On that next phase of consignment that we talked about, as Dave just mentioned, that’s going to take those distribution inventory weeks, from about four to maybe about three over the next year or so. That did put some headwind on our third quarter revenue of about $20 million. And it is probably going to put – it is putting another $50 million or so to our fourth quarter revenue. That is incorporated of course in our guide. Of course, that is a small part of what’s going on here. As we’ve said, most of our markets have slowed down and that’s the main driver of the guidance that we’re giving.
David Pahl
Great. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes, I did, and that was helpful. What was the book-to-bill for the quarter?
David Pahl
Our book-to-bill, I knew you would ask that question. It is 0.96 in the quarter. And as I always give that number, I have to – for those who don’t follow us and talk about the consignment programs, we don’t carry any orders for that demand. And so book-to-bill, just be careful with the number, use it in the safety of your home. So with that, we’ll move onto next caller please.
Operator
We’ll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
David Pahl
Hey, Vivek.
Vivek Arya
Thank you. Yes.
David Pahl
Are you still there?
Vivek Arya
Glad I’m still here. So when I look at the last two downturns that you guys went through, and I’m just focusing on the core Analog and Embedded business, and I’m talking about say the first half of 2013 or late 2015, they kind of lasted for two quarters, and then you saw your core Analog and Embedded business start to then start to grow year-on-year. I know you don’t want to say anything about the future. But if you were to just help us contrast the customer behavior and the signals that you’re seeing now versus what you saw in those downturns, is there anything that stands out, positive or negative?
David Pahl
Yes, I’d start that as we look at those, and we all look at industry data. As we went through those other downturns, the ups weren’t very strong and therefore the downs weren’t very strong, right? And I think we’ve just described those as we’ve moved through them. It’s just operating in a world that really have low economic growth, right? So the last couple of years, certainly, we’ve had much stronger upturn in the economy overall. The economic growth has been stronger over the last couple of years. So that’s certainly different. I think that our business has continued to evolve. We have more industrial, more automotive business.
We are continuing to invest and ensure that, that revenue is coming from diverse and long-lived places. I think that we’ve continued to invest in our 300-millimeter Analog footprint and grow. So we’ve got that going into the numbers. So – and if you look at the financial performance of the company over those last cycles and even this quarter, and you look at the amount of free cash flow that we’re generating, we just turned in as a percentage of revenue, 37.5%. Those are good, strong numbers. And I think that those are the things that give us confidence to continue to make the investments, to make the business stronger, investing in the competitive advantages. Markets will strengthen and weaken over periods of time. But we continue to stay focused on our opportunity.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, let me comment on that. So yes, to Dave’s point, we have demonstrated for a number of years now the strength of the business model. And that’s through ups and now, downs. And the right thing to do, what we will continue to have done and what we will continue to do is continue to strengthen our competitive advantages so that we continue to become stronger. One of the things or one of the competitive advantages as you know is our manufacturing technologies, specifically 300-millimeter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are looking at the next tranche of capacity. So we are exploring options for our next 300-millimeter factory.
And we’ll likely make a decision within the next year or so. And this slowdown is not going to stop us from putting that in place. Now we’ll do it smartly and the first thing that you have to do when building a factory, we can still buy a factory. But when we are building a factory, it would be to build the shell, the actual building, and then we can decide on equipment more incrementally beyond that. So to give you some things to think about on that front, our CapEx – as we do that, our CapEx will increase to about 6% of revenue. In fact, it’s already there. In the last trailing 12 months, we were at 6.6%.
And then that is excluding the factory shell that I just talked about. So when we went on building a factory, it will be about 6% CapEx as a percent of revenue plus the shell and that shell will be $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years. So I want you, Vivek, to consider that and think about that. So that will be – that’s how we are looking at it and how we are planning the next tranche of capacity. Do you have another question?
Vivek Arya
Yes, thanks for that information. The next question is on buybacks. You bought back $1.2 billion, right. You’ve been very active in buybacks. So with the trailing 12 months, you still have, I believe you said $18.2 billion left. The stock is down 25% from its highs. Is it fair to assume that you can be more aggressive on buyback to take advantage of the stock price? Or in general, how do you think about when to be more aggressive with your buybacks? Thank you.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. First, let me take a step back, what is the objective here? And the objective was to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. So the last 12 months, we generated $5.9 billion of free cash flow. And then we returned $6. 2 billion. So we’ve returned virtually the same thing that we have generated. So that’s consistent with what we’ve done for a number of years. And we will continue to do that. Can we, on the margin, do a little bit more here and there? We could and – but the big picture is that we would return all free cash flow to the owners of the company.
David Pahl
Okay, thank you very much. And I think we have time for one more caller.
Operator
Thank you. We’ll go to Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg
Yes, thank you. And congratulations on that Analog operating margins, that’s pretty impressive. First question, your SG&A was down quite a bit sequentially. It’s now below 10%. Is that going to be sort of the rate that we should consider going forward? And does that kind of already incorporate you managing the OpEx a bit more conservatively?
Rafael Lizardi
What I would tell you, we think of OpEx in general, not just SG&A, but OpEx and SG&A and R&D as investments. Not everything there, but certainly, all of R&D is an investment and part of SG&A – that’s part of SG&A. And that is to drive growth in revenue and free cash flow over the long-term. And that’s how we view that. We suggest you also look at it that way and then it’s easier to then look at it on a trailing 12-month basis. It gets some of the quarter-to-quarter transitions out of the way. That can be a little noisy.
So on that basis, OpEx is up about 2% versus the same time period last quarter – or last year, I’m sorry. And that is a good expectation of how that number should trail. The other thing that I would point to is that SG&A in particular in third quarter was down in part because of our CEO transition. Do you have a follow-up?
Tore Svanberg
Yes, Rafael, that’s very helpful. My follow-up is on inventory days. So I completely get it and I understand the new consignment plan. But how high are you willing to let the inventory days go given the structural change?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes. I don’t want to get into specifics. But I’ll frame it this way. One, as I said, it will likely go above the range. So right now, the range is 115 to 145. So it will likely go above 145. We think like owners. So to me, to us, that is a use of cash, right? So I feel compelled to use that cash for inventory because I think it’s a good return on that investment because it’s going to help us on the other side of our recovery. And as I said, it’s a very low obsolescence type of inventory. But we wouldn’t keep it at those levels indefinitely. If it’s a long lasting slowdown, then we would take additional measures to modulate that inventory, bring it back within the range at some point in the future.
David Pahl
Okay. Thank you very much, Tore. We appreciate all of you joining us tonight. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good night.

Please standby. Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
You likely saw last week we announced that Rich Templeton had resumed the roles of President and CEO along with his current role as Chairman. Rich has successfully led TI for the past 14 years, and under his continuing leadership we look forward to making TI even stronger and better. I've met with Rich several times over the last couple of weeks and I can tell you he's excited to be back. He'll be attending several conferences in the near future and will be meeting with investors over the next few months. As you might imagine, he's fully engaged and busy doing what he does best, and that's executing our strategy, strengthening our competitive advantages, and running our operations with laser focus.
Turning to this quarter's results, I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the second quarter increased 9% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 12% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses.
Earnings per share were $1.40, including a $0.03 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop I'll provide some details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term.
Free cash flow for the trailing twelve-month period was $5.7 billion, up 42% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 36.6% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that's long lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing twelve-month period, we returned $5.6 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our commitment to return all of our free cash flow to owners remains unchanged.
I’ll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, analog revenue grew 12% due to Power and Signal Chain [ph]. High volume declined. Embedded Processing revenue increased 9% from the year-ago quarter due to about equal growth in both processors and connected microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 7% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC.
Now I’ll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial and automotive demand remained strong due to broad based growth. We continue to be pleased with our investments, which are directed across fourteen sectors in industrial and five sectors in automotive and continue to deliver broad based and diverse revenue growth. Personal electronics grew low-single digits with increases across several sectors and customers. These increases were offset by declines at some customers. Communication equipment declined from a year ago and declined low-to -mid single-digit sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael?
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.62 billion or 65.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $825 million, a 2% increase from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing twelve-month basis, operating expenses were 20.6% of revenue within our range of expectations.
Over the last twelve months, we have invested $1.53 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top-line and gain market share. Acquisition charges and noncash expense were $79 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 then declined to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.71 billion or 42.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 47% up from 44.7% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing, it was 35.4% up from 31.2% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the second quarter was $1.41 billion or $1.40 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.83 billion in the quarter. It increased $909 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a lower tax rate as well as higher revenue, which includes more 300-millimeter analog revenue.
Capital expenditures were $249 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $5.73 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis, up 42% from a year ago. In the second quarter, we paid $606 million in dividends, and repurchased $1.02 billion of our own stock for a total return of $1.62 billion in the second quarter. We have returned $5.6 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 41% of free cash flow underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remained strong with $5.13 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we retired $0.5 billion of debt as it became due andraised $1.5 billion of 30 year debt with a coupon of 4.15%. We currently have total debt of $5.1 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.77%. Inventory days were 135, up 2 days from a year ago and within our expected range. We continue to believe there is strategic value in owning and controlling our inventory.
Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.11 billion to $4.45 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.63, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 20% in 2018 and 16% starting in 2019. Just as a reminder, the higher tax rate this year is due to non-cash charges. More details of our expectations for taxes can be found on our website under Financial Summary Data.
In closing, I will know that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years from top-line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our comparative advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products.
We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products, Analog and Embedded Processing, and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, we can now open up the lines for questions in order to provide as many of you possible the opportunity to ask your question please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we’ll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
"
2018-07-24,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Thank you, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. So, David, my first question is just on the high volume analog segment. I think in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that’s declined year-over-year in the June quarter. I’m kind of curious to what extent was that by choice as you pruned the portfolio, to what extent do you think that that's just a handset phenomenon as it builds last year for product cycles more robust than this year? And to what extent do you feel that might be a leading indicator for maybe some excess in the “cycle”?
David Pahl
Yeah, John, thanks for asking that question. I think what we're seeing there is a result of how we've been allocating our resources in R&D. And if you remember back in February in our Capital Management Calls, we went through that. We've got a pretty disciplined process. And essentially, what we're trying to do is steer more money to long-lived revenue opportunities where we've got some level of differentiation and we'll have that for some time.
So, you know, I think when you look at the results overall, revenue grew 12% year-over-year. That’s inclusive of what happened inside of high volume. And again, I think that that's a result of allocating resources to the best sustainable opportunities. If you drop down into there in the prepared comments, obviously industrial and automotive continue to do well. Inside of HVAL, you would see that industrial and automotive did well as well. It just doesn't make up as much of a percentage of that revenue. So anyway we're pleased with that outcome and not surprised by it. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer
Yeah, and then Rafael as my follow-on, I know it's probably better to look at the business trends on a year-over-year basis rather than sequential and on a year-over-year you showed really good operating margin leverage in the embedded business. But sequentially it was flat on op revenue and there's still that gap between embedded op margins and analog op margins. How do you think about the leverage in the embedded market from here? And will we ever close that gap between embedded and analog?
Rafael Lizardi
So, let me step back and take you back to our capital management strategy and some of the things that we say there and how we think about driving value for owners of the company. And to us, it all comes down to growing free cash flow per share. So it's not operating margins, it’s not gross margin, it's not analog versus embedded, it's all about growing free cash flow per share. Both of those businesses are and we expect to continue to be contributors to that free cash flow per share. So the focus is growing the top-line. As we continue to invest in what we think are the best markets, the industrial and automotive, and in the case of analog as we continue to expand our 300-millimeter footprint where we have a structural cost advantage.
David Pahl
Okay, now we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
And we have Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
Timothy Arcuri
Thank you very much. I had a question on the guidance. The June numbers were a little bit below seasonal and I know that seasonal is hard to really figure out what's actually normal. But that was kind of coming off more difficult Q1 comps. But if I look at the September quarter guidance, it's a few hundred basis points below seasonal and it's up like 300 basis points year-over-year, which is you know the lowest in a couple of years. Is there any element of more difficult comps or is there in fact some kind of channel inventory headwinds? Thank you.
David Pahl
Yeah, Tim, I just say that when we put together our guidance, the two strongest signals that we see are orders that we get from customers as well as the demand fees that we get through our consignment programs. And I would just say that if there is something specific to call out as we have in the past, if there was a specific customer or specific end market or something like that that was changing, we would let you know about that.
And as example lead times remain stable, cancellations remain low, reschedules remain low. We look at inventory and the channels and that remained steady at about four weeks. So we really don't see any changes from that standpoint. And the other thing as you pointed out when you look at a couple of data points, it's hard to describe what is exactly seasonal. And so if you look over the last five years, we've had a 9% sequential growth. Three of those five years has been at 6%. And if you look over a ten year period, it's 7%. So certainly our guidance from a seasonal standpoint is certainly within the range of things that we've seen in the past. Do you have a follow on?
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks and then I guess just as a quick follow on. Dave, can you give what orders and book to bill were?
David Pahl
I can give that. Let me just find it. Yeah, so orders, book to bill – orders were up 10% sequentially, book to bill was 1.06. I'll point out it was 1.06 a year ago and 1.03 last quarter. I always feel the need to comment on book to bill with about 60% of our revenue going through consignment programs where we don't get any orders in advance of pull from that demand. So the book to bill isn't as strong of a signal or is at least as clear of a signal as what it used to be in the past. So thank you, Tim. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
And we'll take our next caller from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
Hey, guys.
David Pahl
Hi, Ross.
Ross Seymore
Let me ask you a question. Dave, just want to ask about from – not necessarily a cyclical point of view, but from a macro point of view. With all the discussion of trade wars, tariffs, et cetera, I know you haven't called out seeing anything further, your answer to the last question, but just how does TI in general think about that dynamic as potentially impacting your business? And are you, in fact, seeing any impact as of yet?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, Ross, I will go ahead and take that. First, let me take TI's long-term support of free trade and strong IP protection. And those are both important to TI and the broader ST industry. So we continue – we feel that way. We have stated, we had been in that position for a long time and we continue to do that and advocate that. Specifically on the tariffs that have been announced on integrated circuits, those are still subject to public comment through the end of July, so those are not in place yet.
If – once they go into effect or if they go into effect, remember, they will apply to goods that are deemed of Chinese origin that are then imported into the United States. For TI, only about 13% of our revenue is imported into the United States. In other words, 87% of our revenue is exports, so not subject to U.S. tariffs. And that 13%, only a sliver of that has Chinese origin as a – would be deemed as Chinese origin.
So bottom line, only about 1% of our revenue would have those tariffs applied to it. And that's before we make any potential – any adjustments, supply chain and other things that we could do to even minimize that impact further. So at the end of the day, we don't see a major event or any direct impact other than some minimal impact. Now, that's not to say that at a macro level, that could have an impact, but that's a very macro comment that goes beyond TI and beyond the semiconductor industry that free trade – anything against free trade between the two largest economies in the world, that could eventually have a macro effect that would be detrimental to everybody.
David Pahl
Do you have follow on, Ross?
Ross Seymore
Yeah, I do. Just switching back to your product segments, it seemed like Analog sequentially was pretty much in line what we've seen for the last few years, but Embedded was lower and Other was much higher than what we've seen. And I know you guys think of things year-over-year, but if we look at it sequentially, is there any reasons behind the Embedded being lower and the Other being so much higher?
David Pahl
Yeah, I think if you look at Embedded, it has a higher percentage of comms equipment. So it was impacted by that. And then in Other, don't forget that we've got strong seasonality in second and third quarter. So, thank you, Ross, for those questions. And we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
We have our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks a lot. I guess, two questions for me as well. Maybe first off, could you quantify the revenue impact you had from – not your word, mine – but product rationalization or product optimization that you guys went through in the June quarter? And does that revenue headwind, if you may, flow into the September quarter as well to some degree?
David Pahl
Amit, can you clarify what you mean by product rationalization?
Amit Daryanani
Yes. I think, Dave, when you talked about the consumer-centric markets, you talked about how some of the revenue declines there were driven by the fact that you just decided not to participate in some of these markets, a reflection of how your R&D budgets are tracked over time. Is that fair? And if so, I guess, how much was that revenue impact driven by?
David Pahl
Well, I think, if you look and we shared this back in February on our Capital Management Call. As we looked at allocating resources across end markets and specifically in personal electronics, when you compare our spend there versus five and ten years ago, it's lower. Now, it's not zero. There's still good opportunities that we find inside of personal electronics and continue to invest. We're just looking for sustainable growth opportunities inside of that space. So that's really what we're talking about.
So again, I think the first question came in specifically about one of the businesses inside of our Analog segment. I think you have to judge the efficiency of our capital allocation by the total results. And that, we're quite pleased with. So does that help to answer your question?
Amit Daryanani
No, that's helpful. And I guess, if I could just follow-up, you guys have had multiple quarters of gross margin expansion, very consistent on a year-over-year basis. As you think about the back half of 2018, can you maybe talk about what are the levers that could enable gross margins to continue to expand from here? And do you feel comfortable that gross margin should expand in the back half?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, I’ll go ahead and take that Amit. As we have talked about in Capital Management and in other settings, our focus for value creation for the owners of the company is free cash flow per share. It's not gross margin. It's not operating margin. It's dollars of free cash flow per share. So the opportunity for expanding that and continuing to grow that are simple. It's the top line as we continue to invest in the best products and the best markets and the best markets because that's where the semiconductor content is expanding and we continue to gain share there.
And then, 300-millimeter. We have talked about that for a number of years. As of last year, about $4 billion of our revenue went through 300-millimeter, four out of ten in the Analog space. So that leaves a lot of room for continued expansion on 300-millimeter and continuing to grow that free cash flow per share.
David Pahl
Okay, thank you, Amit. And we will go the next caller please.
Operator
We will take our next question from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur
Yes, good afternoon. Solid job on the quarterly execution and strong free cash flow generation. Your focused markets, automotive, you've got 5 subsegments. Industrial, you've got 14 subsegments. Can you guys just give us a sense on the breadth of the year-over-year growth in these markets? Were a majority of these subsegments up year-over-year? Any color here would be helpful.
David Pahl
Yeah, Harlan, when you look at that growth, we're really pleased with it. It’s very broad based. And when you look at all of the sectors, out of the 19 combined that we had, 18 of them actually grew. So it’s very broad-based. I think when you look across different products, different investments and we look at our design-ins in our pipeline, that – those continue to be very broad-based. So that gives us confidence in the sustainability of that growth. And of course, it doesn't mean that we won't see cyclical headwinds at some point. But when you look at it from a five and ten year standpoint, we feel really good about the progress that we have made. Do you have follow-on, Harlan?
Harlan Sur
Yeah, thanks for the insights there. And so kind of to follow-up on that maybe from a geographical perspective, right? I think last quarter, all regions – and I know this is ship to, right? This is ship to data, but still, nevertheless important, but last quarter I think all regions were up except for Japan. What did you see this quarter?
David Pahl
That is the same story. And my friends in Japan, I've talked to them a couple of times. They're – give them a shout-out to them that the revenue is down, but when you look at – we've got some reporting tools that allow us to look through what we call channel independent reporting. And as you mentioned, it's a ship to. So they're continuing to make progress with the customers there. Just a lot of that revenue ends up shipping either somewhere in Asia or it ships in Europe or in the U.S. even though it's designed in there. So – but the actual measurement that we have is the shipping label on the box. So unfortunately, they're still called out on the conference call, which I know they're not happy about. So thank you, Harlan. And we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from bank of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good execution. For the first one, your CapEx is now – I think it was over 6% in Q2, I think, trailing four quarters, it's 5.5%. Depreciation is now below CapEx. So where are all these incremental investments going? And what is the right long-term model we should assume for CapEx and depreciation?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, let me take that. First let me step back to remind you what the objective is, right, for CapEx. It's to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically to extend our low-cost manufacturing advantage, including 300-millimeter, which maximizes our opportunity to grow free cash flow per share for the long-term. So the percent of revenue is an interesting metric to have in mind, but the real driver is that long-term growth of free cash flow per share.
So we have been – and in periods of sustained strong demand, that CapEx tends to go up and that's part of what you're seeing. That CapEx is going to – is going primarily to support 300-millimeter. There are other things. There's assembly test. There's even other factories where we invest some of that CapEx, but predominantly, it's to continue to expand that footprint of 300-millimeter within our fab and building cost at the existing factories.
Before you go to the next question, I want to go ahead and make a point on free cash flow on our free cash flow growth. In the trailing 12 months, free cash flow grew $1.7 billion from about $4 billion to $5.7 billion, a 42% increase. So what would that drew – what drove that? First and foremost, our profit before tax grew about $1 billion in that comparison. So that is higher revenue, more revenue driven by industrial and automotive, which, again, drove the majority of the revenue growth; and more 300-millimeter, which, to the question earlier, that continues to help with the expansion of free cash flow.
And then second and obviously, tax reform. So in the United States, we had a – we have tax reform and, as we have talked about, that did lower our tax rate in 2018 versus the previous year in a significant way. Additionally, we had about $200 million of year-to-date of one-time tax related benefits that are also associated with tax reform. So that also played a factor in that comparison.
David Pahl
Okay, so with that Vivek do you have a follow-up?
Vivek Arya
Yeah, thanks, Dave. Beyond just the trade issue, I know there has been talk of shortages of passive components. I know you guys don't supply that, but your other peers do. But have you seen your customers behave in a different way, stock up, stock down on various things that might impact your trajectory just because your customers might be short of other components to help complete their systems?
David Pahl
Yeah, Vivek, I think one-thing that we have spend a lot of time trying to do and remain focused on is keeping lead time stable. And for the vast majority of our products, they continue to remain stable. And that doesn't mean that we don't have hotspots and, of course, we'll work with customers to close those gaps as aggressively as we can. And the other important metric that we look in inside of that is on-time shipping performance. So you've got a stated lead time and if you're not shipping inside of that, customers tend to get nervous.
And that has continued to remain at very, very high levels. So we can't see any bottlenecks from customers not being able to get product from other places that shows up in the order book specifically. Could it be there? It certainly could be, but it's not something that we would have visibility into. So I think if we just remain focused on what we can control, which is the lead times and shipping performance, customers can have confidence in getting product from us. Okay, we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is ask about the near-term OpEx trajectory. Normally in Q3, you'd probably be down a little bit sequentially. Is there any drivers or anything that could be going on that would make things into this Q3 different than what we might ordinarily have seen given, I guess, some of the historical trends that we've seen leading into this?
Rafael Lizardi
So, Stacy, as you know, we give revenue guidance and EPS guidance and stop it at that unless there were any unusual trends and if so – right between the lines, and if so, we would point that out. We're not pointing that out because there's nothing unusual. So you should expect just our usual trends within reasonable ranges.
David Pahl
Do you have follow-on, Stacy?
Stacy Rasgon
I do, thank you. There’s earlier question on CapEx. And we know it's elevated now because you guys are out looking for other assets. At the same time, obviously, as you continue to grow, you're filling out 300-millimeter and that's a margin benefit. Do you think, over time, the benefit from increasing penetration of 300-millimeter more than offsets the depreciation expense on your gross margins?
Rafael Lizardi
Well, so the way I like to look at this is from a cash standpoint. So I think of that investment as cash flowing out, the first cell on your spreadsheet, and then after that is return. I don't think about it for those purposes from a depreciation standpoint. So as we continue to invest on 300, we think that is – those are very good, long-term investments that will last for a long time. Any time we put any of these tools in place and the cash fall-through on those investments is pretty high.
David Pahl
Okay, thank you very much, Stacy. And I think we have time for one more caller.
Operator
And we have one more question from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
Great, thank you. You said that some of your personal electronics markets were up and some were down. Can you give me a bit more color on which? And I know smartphones, in particular, I think grew in Q1 as smartphones continue to grow into Q2? Thanks.
David Pahl
Yeah, Joe, I won’t go into that level of detail. We did want to give some color on what was going on inside of personal electronics that we see – we saw multiple sectors growing inside of there. We had some customers that were growing, but also wanted to point out not all customers were growing. So that's what we saw. I think what that illustrates is the power of having a diverse product portfolio and being able to sell to multiple customers.
And kind of to my point earlier, we look at the opportunity inside of personal electronics. Longer term, we don't see that as a significant growth engine for us, but it is a place that we continue to invest and we really believe the majority of the growth is really going to come from industrial and automotive. So incrementally, as we've taken up our spend, we've moved it more into those growth areas. So – but again, we're going to have handsets and PCs and those other things for decades to come. So we just find good opportunities inside of there and want to continue to invest in them. Do you have follow-on, Joe?
Joe Moore
Yeah, thanks for the color there. In terms of longer-term question on communication infrastructure, obviously, it's been soft for everyone in the last few quarters. How do you think about the 5G opportunity? I think the comment that you've made just now and repeatedly that the investment areas are industrial and automotive. Do you think there's an opportunity around 5G that you need to invest in? And just to help us understand how that will affect TI.
David Pahl
Sure, yeah, so I think again I would refer back to our capital management presentation as we walked through that thinking remains consistent with that. So from a comms equipment standpoint, I would say that our investments have shifted over time. If you look at the 5G standards and the things needed to support the new things, new frequencies being added, things like the massive MIMO, antennas that are going in for beamforming and other things like that, that is all complexity that you find in the radio itself.
And for us, that translates into Analog products to be able to support that. So our spend in Analog is up for supporting that 5G transition. It has been for some time when we look at our spend versus, say, 5 and 10 years ago. But at the same time, that same change in standards and mix really doesn't impact the digital side. So our spend actually is down on that. So again, I'd describe our growth primarily coming from industrial and automotive as we look over the next decade. So that's where we've tried to increase spending, but we will shift spending around to take advantage of things like 5G. And I'd just say that, in general, very confident in our position. And we've got – we're building off of a great position inside of 4G as well. So we're very pleased with those investments.
Rafael Lizardi
So, that was the last call?
David Pahl
Correct.
A - Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, so before we close, I just want to make a point because it wasn't asked, but our results, among other things, demonstrate our continued discipline and execution on capital management strategy. We generated on a trailing 12-month basis $5.7 billion of free cash flow and we would return $5.6 billion of free cash flow in that timeframe. So virtually, all free cash flow generated was returned to the owners of the company. That was both through dividends and buybacks. In the case of dividends, on that comparison, it was 41% of free cash flow. So right between 40% and 60% guidance, but clearly towards the lower end, so I'd just underscore the sustainability of those dividends.
David Pahl
Okay, thank you, Rafael and thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.

And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments First Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will also be available through the website.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 11% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the industrial and automotive markets. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 14% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.35, including $0.14 in tax-related benefits not in our original guidance. These were primarily due to the recent tax reform law.
With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.9 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 32.1% of revenue, up from 30.7% a year ago.
We continue to benefit from the quality of our product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $5.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year-ago quarter, Analog revenue grew 14% due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year-ago quarter due to growth in both Processors and Connected Microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from a year ago primarily due to Custom ASIC products.
Now, I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Industrial demand remained strong with broad-based growth. Automotive demand remained strong, with all sectors contributing to growth. Personal electronics grew, with increases across several sectors and customers. Communications equipment declined, but was about even compared with the fourth quarter. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
As we get more insight into and guidelines on the tax reform law, we have updated our tax estimates. First, we now expect a 16% ongoing annual operating tax rate starting in 2019, down from our prior expectation of 18%. Second, for 2018, investors should now assume a 20% annual operating tax rate, down from our prior expectation of 23%. The 2018 rate is higher than the 2019 rate due to a transitional non-cash expense in 2018. As a reminder, our operating tax rate does not include any discrete tax items.
To get you to an effective tax rate by quarter, for the balance of the year, we continue to expect the benefit from stock-based compensation to be about $10 million in the second and third quarters, and about $5 million in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the effective tax rate will be about 20% in each of the remaining quarters of 2018. You will find this information summarized on our IR website under financial summary data as we have done in the past.
And then lastly, in the first quarter of 2018, we had about $140 million of tax benefits that were not in our original guidance. These include $50 million due to stock-based compensation, $50 million due to the updated estimates related to the tax reform law, and $40 million primarily due to the previously described decrease in the tax rate for 2018.
In summary, we continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. These markets also provide diversity and longevity. All of this translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.45 billion, or 64.6% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin increased 160 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $818 million, a 1% increase from a year ago and about as expected. R&D grew 4 % and SG&A was about even. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 20.9% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.52 billion in R&D. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D that allows us to continue to grow our top line and gain market share.
Acquisition charges, a non-cash expense, were $80 million. Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019, then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years. Operating profit was $1.55 billion, or 40.9% of revenue. Operating profit was up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 45.4%, up from 41.4% a year ago, and for Embedded Processing was 35.4%, up from 29.9% a year ago.
Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the first quarter was $1.37 billion, or $1.35 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $189 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.92 billion on a trailing 12 month basis, up 17% from a year ago.
In the first quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $873 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.48 billion in the first quarter. We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the same period, our dividends represented 45% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt is also $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 136, up 4 days from a year ago and within our expected range.
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $4.10 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit.
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance over the last few years, from top-line growth and margin expansion to free cash flow generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach, and diverse and long-lived products.
We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products Analog and Embedded Processing and the best markets industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Rafael, operator, you can open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up.

[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and consistent execution. For my first question, since you guys have such a wide perspective on the global economy, I was wondering if you could give us a sense on what you are seeing versus for example what you might have thought at the start of the year. Are you noticing any areas of slow down or pause or anything because your Q1 results are very strong, Q2 is above consensus expectations perhaps sequentially it's not what it has been in the past. So just broadly what you're seeing in the economy versus what you thought three months ago?
Rafael Lizardi
Let me -- I will start with that and then Dave, you want to chime in on that. But I will tell you from a global standpoint, but we're seeing a very continued -- that the macro economy continues to be constructive although uncertainties have been introduced clearly with the -- in the geopolitical area. With everything going on that we read in the news. Now it's too soon is that -- what that impact is going to be on the macro level. From what's important though on a year -- from a year ago basis we continue to see strength in industrial and automotive, as Dave highlighted in his prepared remarks. Personal electronics grew across several sectors and while communications equipment declined, it was [above reasonable] sequentially. Dave.
Dave Pahl
I think Vivek when you look at the quarter with revenue increasing 11%, the demand continuing to remain strong in both industrial and automotive and I just described that demand is continuing to be very broad-based. So I think that speaks to you. One of our competitive advantages which is diversity and longevity of products, so we're certainly benefiting from that today. Do you have a follow on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya
CapEx its up 42% on a trailing 12 month basis running ahead of revenue growth that's closer to 5% or 6% up there versus the 4% target. I'm curious why is CapEx growing so much faster when you're only 50% utilized in your 300 millimeter factory? I mean should we look at growing CapEx as a sign of confidence in demand or at what point should we be worried that maybe you are going to buy too much inventory?
Rafael Lizardi
I will give you a few -- a few things on that. First most importantly let's step back and think about what is the purpose of CapEx. We talked about this during our capital management strategy a couple of months ago. In CapEx our objective there is to support technology development and revenue growth. We want to expand our low cost manufacturing advantage specially to the 300 millimeter where the only analog company with its own 300 millimeter factory and what that does at the end of the day is allow us to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth. So that's what the ultimate objective is. The CapEx percent of revenue that's just a general guide that we gave.
And on that our sense is that 4% that could vary depending on what's going on in the marketplace, because of very strong demand, when we are expanding capacity, that could run off. And right now on a trailing 12 months basis 4.9%. But of course the reason that would run off is that we see opportunities to continue expanding our technology development and our low cost manufacturing advantage so that ultimately we drive long-term growth of our free cash flow per share.
Dave Pahl
Thank you, for that and we can go to the next caller please.
Operator
We will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
First I wanted to ask about OpEx, in Q1 it was -- it grew but probably a little less than with ordinarily be typical sequentially. Were there any specific drivers to that maybe push out of spend maybe into Q2 and I guess along those lines Q2 OpEx would usually up a little bit? Any change that we should expect from what will be typical there?
Rafael Lizardi
On OpEx on first quarter, it came in about as expected and we continue to be pleased with how we are allocating capital to OpEx in general, specifically to our R&D as it continues to drive growth in the top line and we continue to gain market share. On the subsequent quarter as you know, we gave a range on revenue and EPS we don't give in between the lines. If there was something unusual going on we would point that out, we are not pointing out because there is nothing unusual going on in between those lines.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-on Stacy?
Stacy Rasgon
I wanted to ask about the [Technical Difficulty] grew year-over-year. I was also surprised just given what we've heard from other players in that space right now. Could you give us a little more color, I think you said like in certain segments could you give us a little more color about what's actually going on under the covers in personal electronics? And I guess, whether or not you see the current trends actually extending into next quarter given what is going on in the supply chain?
Rafael Lizardi
Let me talk about this quarter that we are reporting and wait for second quarter results to go through the details there. We described that we saw growth across several sectors and several customers, so you know that we tried to point out there it is not just the insets that are growing there are other things are growing inside of that. And I will describe the growth as somewhere in the mid to single-digit. So good growth, especially for a sector like personal electronics. Long-term of course, we think that we will see auto and industrial driver business that where we've been allocating increasingly our capital too. And that's just the belief that those will be the two areas that will drive growth not just for us but certainly in our industry overall.
Operator
Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
On inventory Dave I think Q1 inventory grew about 4% sequentially. I think days inventory grew a little bit as well. Can you describe how you guys see internal inventory today? And if you can comment on the channel, where you guys are seeing the channel that will be helpful as well?
Rafael Lizardi
I'll talk about internal inventory and then Dave will talk about channel inventory. But on inventory let me step back again and refer you to our long-term objective that we talked about at the capital management call. What do we want inventory for? The objective of our inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, minimize obsolescence, improve our manufacturing asset utilization and we also see value in controlling that inventory, having more of it in our own product distribution centers, more in consignment, more in low-volume buffers. I talked about this at the capital management call as well as 90 days ago when we closed the last quarter and this topic came up. So we're very pleased where our inventory ended up. From a day space as it was 136 days, from a year ago that's up 4 days, sequentially is up 2 days and is well within our 115, 145 day inventory basement.
Dave Pahl
And Toshiya from a channel standpoint inventory remains at about 4 weeks and I will just as a reminder for those that are not familiar as Rafael pointed out there is -- we believe that there is value in owning and controlling our own inventory, and actual result is in the consignment program. So, about 65% of our distribution revenue is shipped through a consignment program, so that 4 weeks really represents maybe half to third of what many of our peers will run in the channel. So we feel that's a good level. That combined with the inventory positions that we have on our books. Do you have a follow on Toshiya?
Toshiya Hari
I do thank you. So on communications equipment specifically I think 3 months ago, you guys talked about the business being a little bit choppy and today I guess you told us that revenues were down year-over-year and flattish sequentially. At what point would you this expect this business to revert to growth, is that sort of in the second half of '18 given lower comps or do we need to wait longer for this business to start growing again?
Dave Pahl
Yeah so I won't try to predict what the back half of the growth for comms equipment will look like. As you mentioned and you have been following the industry long enough you know that factor is just choppy the way that operators place orders and the OEMs have to build inventories to respond to that. That doesn't make it a bad business. It is just the nature of it and there will be more communications equipment shift in the coming years. So we have got a great position today in 4G products. We will have a great position in 5G products and really any time trying to figure out when that mix will begin to shift and we will just enjoy the demand as it comes in. All right we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question will come from with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
Why don't you just talk about what you're seeing, you mentioned channel inventory. If you can speak to your customer's inventory a little bit and I guess we've seen shortages of things outside of your space like passives and embedded memory and things like that. Is that causing any change to your customer's inventory behavior in your business either because they have inventory waiting for those things are in shortage or are they holding more of a buffer or is it sort of business as usual?
Dave Pahl
I would say that we got no indications of inventories growing or double orders for that matter, which history suggests also and very quickly pointing out that you never really see that ahead of time. So I think with that said I think it is always important to qualify what we can see. So we've got good visibility in the distribution inventories that I talked about earlier, good portion of that remains on consignment. So we will actually hold the inventory on our books. Our visibility in the customer inventories varies -- really it depends on whether we've got consignment or not. So with consignment OEMs we are carrying that inventory, on our books. And we are not seeing anything that I would describe as unusual signals things like expedites and things like that would suggest that there would be some other broader issue.
Now our visibility inventory beyond our customer's manufacturing operations of course is very low. So our lead times remain stable. Of course, we always have hot spots, we work aggressively with customers to close and other metrics like cancellations, reschedules those also remain at very low levels. So those are the things that we can see and we can measure. And for a long time we will just try to keep doing what we have been doing which is with our manufacturing and internal inventory strategies we just stay focused on keeping those lead times stable. And more importantly delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence that they can get support from us when they need it. You have follow on Joe?
Operator
Our next question will come from Chris Danley with Citigroup.
Chris Danley
First question just a quick one. So sequentially revenue increased the gross margins were down a bit, can you comment on why that happened?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, when you look at gross margin fall through which kind of was embedding your question there, in any one sequential transition particularly when revenue was about flat is up 1% is difficult to do that analysis and make -- have anything meaningful come out of that. You probably want to look at it on a year-on-year basis and on that basis our gross margin, gross profit margin increased 160 basis points the fall through was about 78%. And that's along the lines of what we have guided all of you before that on a long-term basis that falls through that you should expect from our revenue gross should be between 70% to 75%.
Chris Danley
Yes, so my follow-up. You never said but the tax rate continues to go down. Can you just talk about your plans for this extra cash? Is it possible I know you usually raise the dividend sometime around August or September? Is it possible or feasible you could raise the dividend twice this year? Why not crank up the buyback a little bit more, I think you took your share count down by just a couple of million around that?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, let me step back and talk about cash return and how we think about that and then how we think about dividends and repurchases. From a cash return standpoint our objective to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. And we have been doing that for a number of years. In fact on a trailing 12 month basis we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow and we have returned $5.1 billion of free cash flow. So we are doing that. Now obviously we do that in two ways, dividends or repurchases. From a dividend standpoint we want to provide sustainable and growing dividend. As of the end of last year we have been growing that dividend 24% on a compounded basis for the previous five years, and at the end of last year also on a trailing 12 month basis that's 45% of free cash flow. So that underscores the sustainability.
On the repurchases, we just got done repurchasing $873 million of our own stock and our objective there is accretive capture of the future free cash for the long-term owners of the company. So we just resell our assumptions to extrapolate estimate what we think our free cash flow growth is going to be and then based on that we come up with different scenarios and valuation as well as the market prices below those scenarios, we buy back the stock and that's what you have seen us do for a numbers of years now and we will continue doing that.
Dave Pahl
Okay thank you. Chris, we will go to our next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis
Actually maybe I could just follow-up on the last question on gross margin, made on guide specifically in for June but just kind of similar question. Sequential growth in the June, what's the way to think about gross margin is there any segment to think about mix wise or such as to why the gross margin will be up?
Rafael Lizardi
I will just tell you of course for, whenever you in fact hear a specific projection on that we give the revenue range and an EPS range. But the bigger picture on that is that; a, we continue to drive revenue growth and that's the biggest contributor to free cash flow growth. And then in addition to that we continue on increasing our loadings on 300 millimeter, which has 40% cost advantage, that's one of our competitive advantages. We're the only Analog company with own 300 millimeter factory. So every time we build an incremental wafer on 300 millimeter we have better fall through on that. We have better free cash flow per share growth. So we will continue to do that for the foreseeable future and even beyond the current capacity of [those taxes].
Blayne Curtis
Just in the March quarter you saw a good strength in embedded and particularly processors wondering if you can just speak about that strength in terms of end market or particular product discussed will be helpful?
Dave Pahl
If you look at embedded overall and processors specifically they have a very high exposure to industrial and automotive. So that growth is really coming from very diverse places. It will -- connected microcontrollers also grew very nicely as well and again that includes our connectivity products there and they are doing quite well and we are encouraged because that growth is coming from diverse places which I think gives us confidence in the long-term ability of that portion of our business to continue to grow.
Okay Thank you. Blayne we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montreal.
Ambrish Srivastava
Thank you very much Dave, Rafael, I apologize if I had missed it. What were the orders for the quarter?
Dave Pahl
Our orders for the quarter were up about 11% year on year and that put our book to bill about 1.03 and whenever I give a book to bill I always try to remind everyone that we get about 60% of our revenues that go on consignment. So we don't carry backlog, we get orders running up to the quarter they all want -- they have the new revenue [cap-ins]. So always be cautious on both of those numbers. You have a follow on Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes I did and thanks for the color. Geo wise, was there any geos that stood out as stronger, weaker as you went through the quarter? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
So from a geo standpoint we had revenue up in three of the four regions from a year ago. So Asia was up followed by the U.S. and Europe, Japan is down. And a couple of comments, so first, I'll make the comments that that is measured by where we ship the product and not where it's consumed. So usually our regional shipments don't often reflect the broader macro in a particular region. And the second thing then I'll add is from a Japan standpoint we are seeing that companies in Japan are building products in other regions of the world. So as products get designed in Japan they actually may be produced in other regions, so I wouldn't look too much on that as well.
Okay. Thank you Ambrish and we will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We will take a question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
Chris Caso
Just a question on what you saw as perhaps better and worse in the quarter and it looks like the revenues came in a little better than you had expected? Can you talk about what was the driver of that?
Dave Pahl
Yes, Chris, so revenues came in within our expectations for the quarter. Certainly they are in the upper half of our expectations. And I'd just say that of course that was driven by industrial and automotive. And I just say that strength we saw very, very broadly. So there wasn't one specific thing that we point to. And I think again that highlights one of those competitive advantages of diversity in line with positions. That we can see that kind of strength and it comes through and shows up even on the top line. You have a follow-up?
Chris Caso
I do, thank you. And I guess that we've been in a situation where business conditions have been stable if not pretty good for a while. I know you guys have been doing this a while, whenever the things are good in semis we wonder how long it's going to last. Can you talk about perhaps what we're seeing now? What perhaps is different than what we have seen in past cycles? Are there things that TI is doing differently? Is there things within the industry that are different as compared to last cycles such that things would be more stable now?
Rafael Lizardi
What I'm going to point out for this question is that we are now a much larger company in terms of industrial and automotive. Our percent of revenue is as of the end of last year was 54%. You go back a few years ago, that number was sub 40%. And that provides inherent stability to our revenue because our revenue comes from many, many customers, many, many sectors within industrial and many -- in equipment. Now does that mean that we would be immune from a correction? I think a correction would short-term or in medium term would affect all those sectors but the important point is that longer-term this is the place where we want to be, because this is in both of those end markets automotive and industrial. That's where the company is growing. So, even if there is -- when there is a correction and we go through that the end point down the road 10, 15, 20 years from now still the same which is more and more content in those end markets.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Chris, and we've got time for one more caller operator.
Operator
We will take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.
Romit Shah
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hey guys. So just following up on the last question, Rafael if I look at the five and 10 year averages for revenue growth, Q1 has been down low to mid single-digits, Q2 and Q3 have been up high singles and then Q4 has been kind down the most. Given your enhanced exposure to industrial and automotive, do you still think those averages are good guideposts for us as we forecast your business or do you think it's different now?
Dave Pahl
Romit I will take a shot at that. I think that when we look at seasonality, I would remind you that we still have a very nice calculator business that has a strong seasonal pattern with the back to school. So that along with the balance of the semiconductor business in the past has been stronger in the second and third quarters. So as you know for seasonality in general, that makes second and third quarters stronger than the first and fourth quarters. If you look at those sequential changes you will see that you can take an average of them but the lot of the last five or 10 years is a very, very wide range of numbers that are in there. So when we look at it, we just talk about seasonality in those two quarters. Do you have a follow on?
Romit Shah
Yes, thanks for that, just on R&D in the last several years in Q1, R&D has gone up by about 20 million to 25 million, this Q1 R&D was down 1 million. I know that in 2016 R&D grew faster than revenues and then it grew about in line with revenues in 2017. Just given what we've seen so far year-to-date is it reasonable to assume that we might see more R&D leverage this year versus the last couple of years?
Rafael Lizardi
We are pleased that we're allocating capital to R&D, even SG&A and CapEx and ultimately to drive a top line growth in market share. We do that based on long-term expectations on growth particularly industrial and automotive as I talked about earlier given how well our portfolio matches those markets. So we will continue to do that. And if we have opportunities to increase R&D because we have even better opportunities we will do that, if not we will keep it about where it is but we don't have any said percent increase or number to give you.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you Romit and with that we will wrap up the call. Thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter 2017 and 2017 Yearend Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
First, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold an update to our capital management strategy on February 06 at 10:00 AM Central Time. Similar to what we have done in the past, Rafael and I will provide insight into our strategy.
You also likely saw that last week we announced that Brian Crutcher will become President and CEO on June 01 and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you'll join me in congratulating them both.
Before I give you an overview of the fourth quarter results, I want to summarize the impact that December 2017 Tax Reform Act had. We applaud the reform to U.S. corporate law because it enables U.S. headquartered companies like TI to compete more effectively on a global basis. The new law recognizes and rewards companies for exporting and having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the United States.
Regarding the financial implications, there's three important points I'd like to point out. First, investors should assume an ongoing 18% annual operating tax rate starting in 2019. This rate comprehends the 21% statutory corporate rate and the benefit of exports and having manufacturing R&D and intellectual property in the U.S. This rate does not include an estimate for stock-based compensation impact, which we provide at the start of each year.
Second, for 2018 investors should assume a 23% annual operating tax rate before stock-based compensation. This 23% rate comprehends the long-term rate of 18% that I just described plus five percentage points of transitional tax effect that must be expensed in 2018. These transitional tax effects are mostly non-cash.
To get you to an effective rate by quarter, we're assuming about $55 million of stock-based compensation benefit for 2018 split quarterly with $30 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second and third quarters and $5 million in the fourth.
Therefore, the effective tax rate should be about 21% in the first quarter, 22% in the second and third and 23% in the fourth quarter of 2018. You'll find this information summarized on our IR website under Financial Summary Data as we've done in the past.
Lastly, in the fourth quarter of 2017, our tax expense included approximately $800 million of expense that was primarily related to the recently passed Tax Reform Act. This included about $700 million for the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings as well as about $60 million for a reduction in deferred tax assets. The charge on deferred tax asset is non-cash.
The charge associated indefinitely reinvested earnings will impact cash flow and will be paid over eight years. We'll pay about $60 million in the first five years, $100 million in the sixth, $140 million in the seventh, $160 million in the eight year. This will have impact -- there is no impact to cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of these tax changes.
Of course, our initial estimates of the financial impact on the Tax Reform Act could change as we refine our analysis and if any additional guidance on this new law becomes available. Our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged by tax reform.
With more cash available on an ongoing basis, we'll continue to invest to grow our business, to strengthen our competitive advantages and return all free cash flow to our owners. Again, we believe the reform to U.S. corporate tax will enable U.S. headquartered companies like TI to compete more effectively on a global basis.
Now I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 10% from a year ago as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive and industrial markets. Communications equipment declined, while personal electronics grew mid-single digits, but results varied by customer.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 11% and embedded processing grew 20% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.34 including $0.75 of tax-related expenses not in our original guidance, primarily due to the recently passed Tax Reform Act that I just discussed.
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of our ongoing strength of our business model. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.7 billion up 14% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin for the same period was 31.2% of revenue, up from 30.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that's long-lived and diverse and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output.
We believe free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In 2017, we returned $4.7 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago quarter, Analog grew 11% due to power and signal chain. High volume declined. Embedded processing revenue grew 20% from a year ago quarter due to growth in both product lines, which are processors and connected microcontrollers.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 16% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties which began in the first quarter of 2017. For the year in total, Analog and Embedded, each grew about 16% on broad-based growth and combined are now 90% of TI's revenue.
Let me describe our -- next our revenue by end market in 2017. Just as a reminder, we provide an estimate of TI's revenue by end market on an annual basis. We break this into six categories; industrial, automotive, personal electronics and that'll include things like mobile phones, PC, tablets and TVs, comps equipment, enterprise systems and everything else which is primarily calculators. Notably, every market contributed to growth in 2017.
Specifically, industrial comprised 35% of our revenue, up two percentage points from 2016. Automotive was 19% up one point. Personal electronics was 25%, down one point. Comps equipment and other were 12% and 3% respectively, down a percentage point, while enterprise systems was about 6% in both years. Also, we did not have a customer who was more than 10% of our revenue in 2017.
We continue to focus on our strategy on industrial and automotive markets where we've been allocating capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets.
They have increasing semiconductor content and these markets provide diversity and longevity. Taken together, this all translates to a high terminal value of our portfolio.
In 2017, industrial and automotive combined made up 54% of TI's revenue up from 42% just four years ago. We've established momentum in these markets and we are far from satisfied and continue to make improvements.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.44 billion or 65.1% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing cost. Gross profit margin increased by 250 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $795 million.
Operating expenses on a trailing 12-month basis were up 3% and were 21.4% of revenue, within our range of expectations. For the year, we have invested $1.51 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.
Acquisition charges will be about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019 due to amortization of intangible. It will decline to about $50 million per quarter for two remaining years.
Operating profit was $1.56 million or 41.7% of revenue. Operating profit was up 17% from a year ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 46.9% up from 43.2% a year ago and for a better processing, it was 34.3% up from 28.8% a year ago. Our focus investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Other income and expense declined $176 million as we signed several intellectual property agreements in the year ago quarter that will not repeat or that did not repeat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $344 million or $0.34 per share, which included $0.75 in tax-related expenses not in a prior outlook as we have discussed.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.93 billion in the quarter, up 39% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $231 million in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we paid $611 million in dividends and repurchased $706 million of our stock for a total return of $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $4.47 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We issued $500 million of debt in 10-year notes during the quarter. This leaves total debt of $4.1 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.05%. Inventory days were 134 up eight days from a year ago and within our expected range.
Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2017, cash flow from operations was $5.36 billion up 16% from the previous year. Capital expenditures were $695 million or 4.6% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectations. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.67 billion or 31.2% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model.
As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. We remain committed to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company.
Total cash returned to owners in 2017 was $4.66 billion. This combined returns of dividends and share repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return all free cash flow to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $2.10 billion in dividends or about 45% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability.
Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.3% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count.
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.79 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.17, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit.
In closing, I'll note that the strength of our business model was demonstrated throughout our financial performance, from topline growth and margin expansion to free cash generation. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are technology manufacturing, portfolio breadth, market reach and diverse and long-lived products.
We will continue to strengthen these advantages to the disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best products; analog and embedded processing and the best markets, industrial and automotive, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for a long time to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lineup for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for a follow-up. Renee?
"
2018-01-23,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya
Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on what you're seeing in different end markets at the start of the year? When I look at your Q1 sales outlook, it's in line with consensus; seasonally somewhat conservative after seasonally or below seasonal quarter you had in Q4?
And Dave, it seems to be in somewhat contrast to the very strong micro environment. So, is there something that you're seeing that is keeping you more conservative than usual?
Dave Pahl
Yeah Vivek, first just take a look at the results in total. If you look at the quarter, fourth quarter came in with 10% year-over-year growth. We just took for the year, the company came in at 12% year-over-year growth. And if you look at the outlook, at the midpoint, we would be at mid-upper or I'd say upper single-digit growth overall.
So, I think if you look inside of that, we've continued to see strength in automotive and industrial. The exciting thing about that of course is that both of those markets we think will drive our revenue for quite some time. I think inside of the fourth quarter as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we did see weakness in comps equipment.
That's a market that traditionally is choppy and then in PE it's really more of a mixed bag there and more dependent or varied by customer overall, but again with double-digit growth in the quarter and 12% growth for the year, I'd consider that as still strong performance. Do you have a follow-on?
Vivek Arya
Yeah. Thank you, Dave. So maybe let me ask that same question in a different way. So, you grew 10% in Q4, when I look at Q1, it's pointing to a somewhat deceleration to 7%, which is still impressive but a deceleration regardless. So are you seeing anything in the environment that is making you conservative and for a follow-on from that is do you think this is a sustainable growth rate right.
I know you don't give out full year guidance, but do you see the trend sustainable for the rest of the year, thank you?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, so let me now try to forecast the year. I think as you said, upper single-digits is still strong growth. I think when we look at the macro environment, it overall seems constructive, continues to seem constructive for us. We did see changes in comps equipment.
I wouldn't describe that as something that's necessarily a macro effect. It is just what it is that continues to be a choppy market for us, but a good market. It's a market that we continue to invest in and make money there for some time. So overall, I think we're positioned well and again I think that the overall environment in constructive.
Rafael Lizardi
Let me just add to that view, take a step back and think about on the sustainability question, the way we think about our markets, it starts with a global GDP growth, 3% to 4% or so and then semiconductors should grow on top of that 1% or 2%. Particularly, the markets that we focus, which are industrial automotive and that's because, that's where the semiconductor companies have been.
And then on top of that, we've been gaining share in Analog and Embedded on a pretty consistent basis. So, you can think of another point or two on top of that for our long-term sustainable growth. Of course, any one quarter, even any one year, that can vary, but over the long haul, this is a great market to be in particularly industrial automotive, which is where we're focusing our investments, our efforts because that's what the semiconductor content growth is happening.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to our next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Did 21% roughly growth that you had in your industrial business, any color you can provide Dave on what's going on underneath the covers there? That's a very, very impressive number and kind of getting at the same sustainability question, any color that you could give looking backward might be helpful?
Dave Pahl
Yeah you bet Ross and I think if you, the numbers that we provide you are a rounded percentages, so I would describe industrial growth overall in the upper teens when you look year-over-year and that growth is based on almost all sectors growing. So very, very diverse.
That's one of the things that we -- that we like about it and for those that listen to us regularly, you've heard me talk about the 14 different sectors that we have that make up the industrial segment now include things like factory automation and control, industrial transport and things that you would expect, but it also includes things like medical and healthcare, avionics appliances and those types of things that perhaps the financial community wouldn't put inside of industrial, but behaves much in the same way. So that's why they're in there.
So, we're really pleased with that growth. What's encouraging about it again is it's coming from very diverse sources and it's really about content gains inside of that market. Do you have a follow-on Ross?
Ross Seymore
Yeah, I do. Switching over to the OpEx side for you either you or Rafael, in 2017 there was a big delta between what R&D did versus SG&A and then now also that you have some better profitability with the tax rate being lower, really just wanted to see what your views are on the OpEx side of the equation overall?
Will you spend more now that you have more cash and how will it be split if any differences between those two buckets?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah Ross, what I would tell you is that first at a high level, OpEx to us is an investment, whether it's R&D or SG&A. In the case of R&D, obviously we're putting out more differentiated products, focused on industrial and automotive to strengthen our competitive advantages, in this case, the breadth of portfolio for us.
In the case of SG&A, there are a lot of things there, but one thing that we've been focusing on is the migration and that strengthens another competitive advantage which is a channel advantage. So, we did that in 2017. Our OpEx was up about 3% and we're going to continue focusing our investments on that.
On the second part of your question on tax reform, and by the way on that, let me step back for a second. As Dave said during the call, that is a great thing. We're very happy with tax reform. It's going to enable companies like TI, U.S.-based companies to compete more effective on a global basis.
Now we are on an even playing field versus companies outside the United States. So that is great, but our long-term investment strategy remains unchanged. We're going to continue investing to strengthen our competitive advantages as we have talked about before and now with more cash, we're going to do that and then we're going to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company, which is our commitment as part of our capital management strategy and we have been talking about for a number of years.
Dave Pahl
Right. Thank you, Ross and I will go to our next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We move next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dave, you talked a little bit about the communications equipment market and the weakness there. Was that focused on around a single region or a couple of customers or was it broad-based and when would you expect that part of the market to inflict to the upside?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Well first I'd say that it was different by customer and it impacted our segments differently because of that exposure and it's really hard to predict what direction that market will take over the long term.
The good news is that our position even there is very broad-based. So, we will be reflective of the overall market. People will continue to buy communications equipment based stations and things for some time to come. We continue to invest and position ourselves well for newer technologies as they come out. So that includes trends like carrier aggregation or massive multiple antennas that we'll see in later 4G as well as 5G standard.
So very confident about those positions and in the short-term the market will be what the market will be. Do you have a follow-on?
Toshiya Hari
Yes. Thank you. I had a question on inventory at TI what you see in the distribution channel also your end customers, specifically on your own inventory, I was a little bit surprised to see inventory tick up on a sequential basis. I think historically Q4 would be flat to down if I'm not mistaken. So, if you can comment on how you would describe inventory that would be great, thank you?
Dave Pahl
Yeah Toshiya, let me start and then I'll hand it over to Rafael and I think when you look at inventory and I'll start with inventory, the channel it remains steady at about four weeks. I'll point out to those that aren't as familiar with us, that's structurally lower than many of our peers will run because of consignment program. So, you'll see that as a half to about a third as what many of our peers will run and we feel very comfortable at those types of levels.
What we see down channel from customers is we'll depend on what type of arrangements we've got. If we've got a consignment program with them, we can see very into their manufacturing plans and their build plans because we own that material until they pull it, but really our visibility ends there meaning that when they -- if they're building inventory of if they're putting inventory down channel, we can't see that.
But we see no indications of inventory that's building there overall. So, let me turn it over to Rafael about our inventory.
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, so let me step back and tell you how we think about our inventory overall. We want to maintain high levels of customer service; one, to minimize obsolescence, optimize manufacturing utilization and all these things vary depending on multiple factors. For example, consignment, we have many consignment engagements and in fact we want to continue increasing consignment engagement because we get -- we tend to get a better signal to consignment engagement.
So, all that is good stuff. Also step back and think about our strategy focusing on diverse customers, focusing on diverse positions on industrial automotive where we design a part in industrial and that part may sell for 10, 20 even 30 years. So, the inventory is good for a long, long time.
So, we don't have to worry about this obsolescence risk that maybe in the past we have the other types of focus that we had. So, in this particular case, in the fourth quarter inventory days ended up at 134, that's within our range and we had a chance to replenish some of our low-volume high mix stuff.
So, we're going to -- we did some of that. In fact, we're going to continue doing that because over the long haul, as we would replenish that, we have inventory available to sell to those industrial and automotive customers and be able to keep those high level for customer service.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thank you, Toshiya. We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave or Rafael, maybe just to follow up on the inventory question, I guess maybe asked a different way, were you planning to grow inventory sequentially in the calendar fourth quarter or did it end up growing because some revenue upside did not materialize in the quarter?
And I guess importantly as you look out to calendar first quarter, how do you expect to management inventories for the calendar first quarter? Will it come down from here? Are you taking any unusual utilization action around inventory to bring it down?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, what I would tell is inventory came in about as expected. And on the second part of your question, of course we don't get into that level of detail, but I would tell you that as I mentioned to the earlier caller, we want to have buffers of inventory, particularly when addressing the industrial market, but also the automotive market.
It's a good thing to have to these buffers and we have many, many of our products are low-volume high mix and by the way those are products that last for -- we can keep them for 10 years in our shelves and then we sell them to our customers for 20 or 30 years.
So, from a manufacturing standpoint, it makes sense to build them and keep them in storage and building them in batches and it's just a lot more efficient that way. So, we did that in fourth quarter and if depending on the market, we can now build some more in the first, second and third, we'll do that again.
Dave Pahl
Yeah and I'll just add kind of the corollary to the point that Rafael made. We do look at risk of obsolescence. So, if we have a part that's a custom or primarily used by one or two customers, we'll tend to keep very low inventory on those parts. So, managing that inventory stack to risk of obsolescence is something that we aggressively do. Do you have a follow-on John?
John Pitzer
Just to be clear, is this a change in sort of your long-term inventory targets or are we just kind of still within those targets, just perhaps maybe migrating to the higher ends?
Rafael Lizardi
The objective is the same. As far as the target, as we do every year, we look at our metrics for the capital management strategy and as you know, we have 10 or 12 metrics. So, we look at those and if we need to do tweak them, we tweak them. So, if February sticks with our call and we'll go to there and if we need to tweak some of those metrics including inventory, we will do that at that point.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, John. We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Hey. Good afternoon, guys and solid job on the quarterly execution. Can you just give us an idea of the breadth of the demand trends on a year-over-year basis by geography? I think last quarter you guys saw year-over-year growth in most geographies except for Japan which was flat. Just wondering if the strength continues to be broad-based here?
Dave Pahl
Yeah Harlan, it was broad-based. We saw revenue growth in Europe, in Asia as well as the U.S., but again this year, Japan was down. It's almost very similar, but I would describe that the growth is being very broad-based. Do you have a follow-on?
Harlan Sur
Yes, I do. Thanks for that. Your analog revenues grew by about $1.4 billion in 2017 and if my memory serves me correctly, you guys exited 2016 with your 300-millimeter fabs diving about $2.5 billion in revenues on an annualized basis. Is it therefore fair to assume that you're driving now close to about $4 billion in revenues through your 300-millimeter analog fab? So, utilization roughly about 48%.
Dave Pahl
Yeah that's -- you're right in zip code Harlan and so we ran about 50% of that capacity in our 300-millimeter fabs which includes the Richardson fab and also DMOS6, so somewhere in the ZIP Code of about $4 billion of revenue and I think as we look at that and just to take a step back, manufacturing and technology is one of our four competitive advantages. 300 millimeter is probably one of the best examples that we can point to inside of that.
And we have because of 300 millimeter, when you look at the number of dies, we produce on that versus 200 millimeter, we just have a structural cost advantage on every wafer that we build and every dollar of revenue we put through there. So that's the benefit that has -- we've accrued over the years and have increased that.
But the great news is we continue to have a lot of -- a lot of headway, a lot of runway ahead of us. So…
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, just to build on that, that is part of what's supporting the free cash flow grow that we're seeing. This year free cash flow growth was 14% on a per-share basis with 16%. Just to illustrate the strength of the business model with the competitive advantages, our focus on auto and industrial and analog and embedded.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Chris Danely
Thanks guys. I guess first question for Rafael, if you look at your cash flow deployment over the last few years, it will take out I think around $500 million in debt and then the rest of it goes to kind of one third buyback, two thirds dividend with the extra cash. Can we assume those same ratios or would you look to take out a little more debt or keep the kind of the same?
Rafael Lizardi
So, Chris you have a few things there. Let me may be take one at a time. First with the debt, the way we think about that is we take on debt when economics make sense and right now the economics make sense. We have $4.1 billion of debt and is at a 2.05% weighted average coupon rate.
And the one we took out recently was 10-year debt at 2.9%. Of course, that's pretax. So, the economics make sense and of course we do it in a very judicious way. We have -- we don't have concentrated maturities and we maintain a strategic flexibility.
On the first part of your question, our commitment is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company. You know us for a long time and you know that we've been doing that. This year for example, we generated $4.7 billion free cash flow and we returned guess what $4.7 billion. So, we're committed to doing that and we do it through both dividends and buyback.
This year dividends were $2.1 billion, buybacks $2.6 billion. We have a robust and flexible model to do that. It doesn't have to be necessarily any particular split. Dividends would like to be between 40% and 60% of free cash flow of the current year and essentially repurchases is everything else. Do you have a follow-up on that?
Chris Danely
Yeah thanks. Another I guess historical/longer-term question. So Q4, you guys are roughly on a sequential basis seasonal and if you look at I think the six quarters before that, every quarter was probably 1% to 3% about seasonal. So, are you seeing things I guess stabilizing or are cooling-off or any signs of that in the industry or am I just looking at the numbers too much and doing a little paralysis by analysis?
Dave Pahl
Maybe more of the latter. I'd just say, when you look at the numbers Chris, really from the topline growth down to free cash flow generation, you just see the strength in the business model right. We've got -- we've been investing in analog and embedded. They represent 90% of our revenue. They go through 16% year-on-year.
Industrial and automotive make up 54% of that. So, we won't control the short-term demand. It is what it is, but when you look at those numbers overall, I think at least when we look at it, we think -- we think they look pretty solid. So, thank you and we'll go to our next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford C. Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding the near-term OpEx trends, last few quarters OpEx come in light at least verses street expectations. I know you guys don't guide short-term OpEx, but I'd say this time it came a little higher than at least what we had expected. How did OpEx come in versus your own expectations in the quarter and how should we be thinking about as we go into Q1? Are there any I guess changes or differences versus what might ordinarily see in a typical Q1 in terms of your plans?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah Stacy, first OpEx came in about as expected. That's a short answer to the first question. Then before I go to the second question, let me take a step back. I think I alluded to this earlier, but just to mention and again we see OpEx as investments right. Whether it's R&D or SG&N and those were up 3% for the year. So very reasonable given the growth that we're turning our key markets in analogue and embedded and industrial and automotive.
So, we're getting the results that we want from those investments. And those investments go to strengthen our competitive advantages and in the case of R&D maybe the easiest thing to point out is the broad portfolio that continues to grow and strengthen.
And in the case of SG&A the easiest one to point to is demand creation and everything that we're doing there. Going to the second part of your question on the first quarter, as you know we don't get into specific detail there. What I'll tell you that it's normal.
People are still going to take less vacation in the first quarter than they do in fourth because of Christmas and Thanksgiving and other things and we still have pay and benefit increases in February. So, we expect about the same as we usually expect in that transition.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow-up Stacey?
Stacy Rasgon
I do. Thank you. Around the inventory buffers that you were talking about putting in place, are you actually seeing shortages or lead times for those specific products actually just beginning to extend to drive that buffer addition or are you just being sort of proactive about getting in place now?
And how much of the I guess inventory you guys -- total inventory as it stands today out of the $1.96 billion would correspond to some of these buffer areas?
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah, let me start and then Dave will chime in on the rest of your question, but the buffer, this is nothing new. We've had about four, five, six years or so obviously depending on demand, strength of demand, it fluctuates. We were able to build or it would drain in the buffers.
So that's what they are there for. At times, we drain them. And frankly off the top of my head, I couldn't tell you how much of the $1.9 billion and change is for the buffers, but the bigger point is why we have the buffers?
We're focusing end markets but industrial is the best example. We have a lot of small customers across the world, in the middle of the U.S., in Shenzhen, in the middle of Germany. Small customers focused on 14 sectors, hundreds of end equipment. You couldn’t possibly build to order that stuff right, because if any one customer may order a few thousand pieces, so what you do is you build in, in bigger batches you store it and then you sell over time.
And because the parts and just in our inventory last 10 years, then it's very affordable. It makes a lot of sense to do that and we do that with very low levels of scrap in any one quarter or any one year.
Dave Pahl
I'll just add, I think when you look we're doing that Stacey, so that our lead time is going to remain stable and then probably coupled with that is we focus on making sure that we've got very high customer service metrics. So, when we say, we were going to ship something that we actually ship it on that date to customers.
And those two things combined are what gives customers confidence that they can get the products that they need from us. So, we spent a lot of time and that's maybe just a highlight that that's one of the initiatives that we've had at our company as we looked at having more analog, more embedded products, more industrial and automotive, we knew we needed to ensure that we put in place the capabilities to be able to service customers of any size and have those types of metrics.
Rafael Lizardi
Yeah and just to add a little bit to that, back on the way we look at inventory, think about improving manufacturing asset utilization. If you can improve and run the factories not completely level because you can never do that exactly like that, but fairly level that.
It goes to a long way to improving your manufacturing processes, your yields, your cycle times and that just translates into lower cost, which gets what translates into more free cash flow and that goes to the strength of our business model how we generate all that free cash flow that we have been growing consistently for what now 13-14 years.
Dave Pahl
Great. Okay. Operator, I think we have time for one more caller please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next caller is David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong
Thanks very much. So, a follow-on from Vivek's question earlier. So, you're seeing a slight deceleration in your overall blended growth, but in the December quarter you had really strong growth in analog and embedded. Would we expect in the March quarter sort of roughly equal deceleration in both analog and embedded or is it one more than the other?
Dave Pahl
Yeah Dave, we provide guidance at the top level for revenue and we try not to get into the corners by markets or by products. So now if there is something unusual going on, either those by market or a specific customer or in one of those business units, we would call that out and there's nothing for us to highlight inside of there. Do you have a follow-on?
David Wong
No. That's good. Thank you very much.
Dave Pahl
Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to Rafael.
Rafael Lizardi
Sure, let me just finish with a few comments on some key items that I want everybody to remember. First, the strength of our business model is demonstrated through our financial performance. We have strong growth in both analog and embedded, which are the best products and industrial automotive, which are the best markets. That's where the semiconductor content growth is happening and we're confident that's the way it will continue to happen for many, many years to come.
Second, as I said before, we're very excited about tax reform. It's made TI just more competitive on a global scale, so we're excited about what we can do with that. And finally, we continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy. We remain committed to returning all free cash flow to the owners of the company. Dave?
Dave Pahl
Thank you all for joining us. Again, please plan to join us for our Capital Management Call on February 6 at 10:00 AM Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.
Operator
Thank you. This does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Good day everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the third quarter increased 12% from a year ago. Demand for our products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive markets.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 16% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share was $1.26.
With that backdrop, I'll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model. In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, and free cash flow margin was 29.0% of revenue.
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.3 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 24% and also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion, which together reflect our commitment to return all of free cash flow to our owners.
I'll now provide some details by segment. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 16% due to growth in power and signal chain. High volume was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 17% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers. In our Other segment, revenue declined $70 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E, which began in the first quarter of 2017.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago. Industrial demand remains strong, with broad-based growth as most sectors grew double digits. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Personal electronics was about even, with results varying by customer. Communications equipment grew while results varied by customer. And finally, enterprise systems grew, primarily due to servers.
We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, where we've been allocating our capital and driving initiatives to strengthen our position. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content and that they provide diversity and longevity of products, which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio.
Raphael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.66 billion or 64.5% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 240 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $787 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, were 22% of revenue, within our range of expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.5 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation.
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.79 billion, or 43.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year-ago quarter.
Operating margin for Analog was 47%, up from 41.2% a year-ago, and for Embedded Processing was 34.9%, up from 28.2% a year ago. Our focused investment on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the third quarter was $1.29 billion or $1.26 per share. This included a $38 million discrete tax benefit that was $18 million higher than our original guidance for the quarter, adding about $0.02 to earnings per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.72 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Capital expenditures were $186 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.82 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $574 million or about 4% of revenue, consistent with our long-term expectation.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.25 billion or 29% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term, and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.
As Dave mentioned already, in September we announced we will increase our dividend by 24% and also increase our share repurchase authorizations by $6 billion. Our quarterly dividend went from $0.50 per share to $0.62 per share, or $2.48 annualized. This is our 14th consecutive year of dividend increases. And over the past five years, we have increased the dividend by a compounded average rate of 24%. Our total outstanding repurchase authorization was about $10 billion at the end of third quarter.
For the third quarter, we paid $495 million in dividend and repurchased $650 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.15 billion in the third quarter. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.99 billion in dividends, or about 47% of free cash flow, evidence of their sustainability.
Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 43% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count.
Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.32 billion. These combined returns of dividends and repurchases and our recent announcement to increase the dividend and share repurchase authorizations demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners.
Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. This is consistent with our long-term objective to have onshore cash readily available for multiple uses. Inventory days were 119, up 1 day from a year ago and within our expected range. Our total debt is unchanged at $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%.
Turning to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit.
Our expected annual operating tax rate for 2017 continues to be about 31%. For fourth quarter 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be about 29%, which includes about $20 million of discrete tax items, up from our previous guidance of $10 million. This is the rate you should use for your model for fourth quarter. For 2018, we're providing you with our quarterly tax rate expectations for both the operating and effective tax rates. You can find this detail on our Investor Relations website under the Financial Summary Data section.
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow up. Rebecca?

Operator
Thank you. And first we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, thanks. This is Adam Gonzalez on for Vivek. So my first question is, last year you guided Q4 pretty conservatively and ended up reporting growth that was about twice as fast. How would you contrast the demand environment this year versus last year? And the reason why I bring this up is because your Q4 outlook of down 10% seems to be below seasonal. And I'm wondering, if that outlook really holds true, what are the areas of weakness that you're seeing that's driving this? Thanks.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. So I think that if you look at our guidance, I'd say that we're not indicating that anything is atypical that's occurring. And I'd just remind you that whenever we've had something that's been unusual, whether that's been by market or by sector or sometimes even by customer, we've been pretty clear on that and would share it, and we've got nothing to share. So I'd just point out that if you look at the range of our guidance, that's going to vary and can comprehend several different scenarios. And at the midpoint, on a year on year basis, we'll grow about 9%, which we consider to be pretty robust. So, do you have a follow-on?
Adam Gonzalez - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. I guess looking at your free cash flow per share growth, the last couple of quarters, it's kind of trended below the longer-term 8% to 10% that you traditionally see. I'm wondering why that is and what are the catalysts to get that back up to where it has been. Thanks.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, Adam, thanks for giving me opportunity to talk about that. On free cash flow, it grew 4% on a trailing 12-month basis, and that is compared to a higher number for revenue on the same basis. And the difference is higher working capital, particularly accounts receivables and tax payments. If you look at the accounts receivable from 3Q 2015 to 3Q 2016, that actually drained whereas from 3Q 2016 to 3Q 2017, it built. So that is a source of cash in one case and a use of cash in another case. But, and in the case of the tax payments, we had a higher, disproportionately higher tax payment in the most recent comparison versus the previous trailing 12-month comparison.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Great. Thank you, Adam. Tell Vivek we said hello, and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Next we'll hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hello. Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution, the free cash flow generation and the capital return. Clearly the demand trends are pretty strong in the markets that you serve. Maybe you could just talk about the demand trends from a geographical perspective. I think last quarter you saw year over year growth in most geographies. I'm just wondering if the strength continues to be broad based.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, Harlan, I would say that certainly the demand was broad based. If you look across our product lines, we've got 65 to 70 different product lines, and the demand was very strong across those as well as strong across the region. So we had revenue up in three of the four regions year on year in Europe, Asia and the U.S., and it was about even in Japan.
And again, I just always remind that when we give regional color, that's where we ship the product. That's what we can measure. Where that product actually ends up from a regional standpoint, we really don't have visibility into. Do you have a follow-on?
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, thanks for the color there. On the OpEx front, great operating leverage. You drove 12% sequential growth in sales, but your OpEx declined by 3%. So you guys are driving some serious leverage here. The OpEx as a percent of sales is actually just below your target range, and so I guess the question is, what drove the sequential decline in the OpEx. And how should we think about the OpEx profile just over the next few quarters?
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, I'll take that. For OpEx, we think of that in terms of, from a model standpoint, we think of it as a percent of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, and for the last couple years, we've actually been running at about 23%. And in the current trailing 12-months, we're about 22% of revenue. So we have said that in a stable environment, which we are, we can run in the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%. So we've been running at about 22%, so that's well within that.
Of course to us, OpEx are investments, and obviously that goes for R&D, but even inside of G&A we think of a large portion there as investment. So in R&D of course we're focusing on industrial and automotive, because those are the best markets. where semiconductor growth is happening. But in the G&A front, we have many investments there on ti.com and demand creation just to continue building on our reach of channels, reach of markets, competitive advantage that we have talked about.
Before we go to the next caller, I'd like to just make a comment on the previous question on working capital. I want to stress that while our accounts receivables increased in that last comparison, the delta days sales outstanding actually decreased by 1 day. So it's at 34. So that just goes to show you how healthy the account receivable balance is. I wanted just to clarify that.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Okay, great. Thank you, Harlan, and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
From Deutsche Bank, Ross Seymore.
Unknown Speaker
Hey. This is Jerrell (17:41) on behalf of Ross. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Just asking about the general end markets here, could you provide some end market detail in terms of how they trended quarter on quarter in addition to year on year?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Sure, Jerrell (17:54). If you look at industrial, it increased with most sectors growing. And again, we've got 14 sectors there, so fairly broad based. Automotive increased with most sectors growing. Personal electronics increased, as one would expect, as you move into the holiday builds with most sectors growing there. Comms equipment was even, and enterprise systems grew due to both servers and projectors. Do you have a follow-on?
Unknown Speaker
Yes. Just a question on the report here. So your September quarter revenues exceeded the high end of your prior guidance, and it's the first time in about a year that happened. However, gross margins expanded just 20 basis points. I think we were expecting more. So given the magnitude of the revenue beat, why didn't higher revenues result in more than 20 basis points of gross margin fall through?
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. What I would tell you is that generally what we suggest and what we recommend to analysts and investors to think about our fall through – in the 70% to 75% range. But that is over the long haul, over a relatively long amount of time. In any one quarter, that fall through can be a little different.
Now for example, in the comparison versus a year ago, which arguably, I would argue is more relevant as it has more time obviously in between, that was close to an 85% fall through, right. The increase in gross margin was 240 basis points, just as an example of a comparison to the sequential basis.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Okay. Thank you, Jerrell (19:38). And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong results. I guess my first question, I'm just kind of curious. When you look at year over year growth now for the core business, Analog and Embedded, you've had very healthy sort of double digit year over year growth. I'm wondering if you could kind of comment to what extent you think that's share gains, to what extent you think that is just easy compares, to what extent you think that might be a little bit of overheating relative to customer order activity. And you did a fantastic job on your own balance sheet, kind of managing inventories. I'm wondering if you could give us some color around customer inventory levels.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. So, John, I think that if you look at general market conditions, they're similar to 90 days ago and certainly continue to remain strong. However, I think it's still yet to be seen how long that will extend over how long of a period of time. So we've got no indications of inventories growing or double ordering. And like I pointed out last quarter, history suggests we never really see that, those types of things ahead of time.
But I think again, it's important to qualify what we can see. So we've got really good visibility into our distributors' inventory, and that remains at about four weeks. It's even both sequentially and year on year. Our visibility in customer inventories will vary depending if we're on consignment or not. So for our consignment OEMs, we hold that inventory on our balance sheet, and we don't see any unusual signals or other things like expedites that would suggest that there's issues inside of that. And our visibility of course into inventory beyond that and down our customers' channels, we just can't see that of course.
So we just remain focused, as we have for a long time, focusing on both our internal manufacturing and internal inventory strategies. And we're focused on trying to keep lead time steady, which they have. Delivery metrics really high because that's what gives customers confidence that they can get the product when they need it.
So you have a follow-on, John?
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yes. I do for Rafael. As I think Harlan mentioned, you guys did a fantastic job on operating leverage in the quarter. When you look at absolute operating profits though, there's still a pretty meaningful gap between the Embedded business and the Analog business. And I think you've commented in the past that, theoretically, there's no reason why that gap can't close over time. I'm kind of curious. When I look sequentially, the operating leverage in the Embedded business was particularly high. I think the fall through was almost 86% Q on Q. I'm just kind of curious. Have we reached a scale point in that business where we would expect fall through to be higher from here on out and that gap to close more quickly? Any comments around that would be helpful.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Sure. Well, to your point, the profitability of that business has in fact improved significantly. On a year on year basis, profit from operation is up 673 basis points. But at the end of the day, the main objective here is to grow free cash flow. We think that is – we believe that is what really drives value for the owners of the company, so and then return all that free cash flow to the owners.
So we're not particularly focused on any one of those percentages because there are many ways to drive that free cash flow and one of them is expanding the margins. But then the other one is just growing the top line at the same margin, right. So that's the key message that the core objective that we're trying to achieve.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And that'll come from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.
Unknown Speaker
Hi, there. This is James Limz (23:52) and Shirley Hu on for Stacy. Sorry if we missed it, but we were just wondering what book-to-bill was for the quarter.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Book-to-bill was, it was 1.0.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
1.0. Yes.
Unknown Speaker
1.0.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
So.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
And again, we always, we give that number. I would say that always be cautious with it because we've got 60% of our revenue that's on consignment that we don't carry any backlog or don't get any orders in advance. So that's part of the reason why we don't focus on it. Do you have a follow-on?
Unknown Speaker
Yes. I guess so. We were just hoping for some more color on the OpEx and why it was a bit light and just how you see that trajectory going forward.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Well, it came in about as expected. So I wouldn't characterize it as a bit light. And as I mentioned earlier on an earlier question, on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how we think is appropriate to look at, is, came in at 22%. I think in the last couple years it's been at 23%. So it's trended a little down over the last few years, but it is well within the bottom half of our expectations of 20% to 25%, which is our expectations when things are stable, which they are now.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Okay. Thank you. We'll go to our next caller, please.
Operator
C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, forward look outlook on gross margins. Can you talk about what you're expecting mix wise and whether that fits in with an incremental gross margin around 70%? Or are there kind of puts and takes around that?
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
On gross margins, what we have said before, and we'll continue to say, really hasn't changed our guidance on that is that our general expectation is revenue to pull through at about 70% to 75%. And that's over the long haul, right, not in any one quarter. So you should think about it that way. And as we continue to grow the top line, driven by our investments in analog and embedded from a product standpoint, and industrial, automotive from an end market standpoint, we expect to continue gaining share and that additional revenue to fall through at about those rates.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Do you have a follow on, C.J.?
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Yes, please. Could you provide an update on where you are on the 300-millimeter? Interested in terms of utilization rates as well as some of the work you're doing on the back end and other fronts to drive even higher incremental margins. Thanks.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, you bet. I think, as C.J. asked that question, there are probably callers on the line and listening that aren't familiar. But we've got four competitive advantages, the first of which is our manufacturing and technology. And I think the 300-millimeter is a good example of that strength.
The other three, just quickly, are the breadth of the product portfolio; our channel advantages, which includes the size of our sales force and ti.com; and then just the diversity and longevity across markets and sectors and customers and products, which I think leads for investors a high confidence and a high terminal value of that product portfolio.
But why 300-millimeter matters is that we've got a structural cost advantage. So with that larger wafer size, we get 40% lower cost on the chip when we manufacture that. And most chips in the industry are built on 200-millimeter. So we started this year, we've had about 25% of our 300-millimeter capacity footprint utilized. Essentially most of the analog growth this year, and as we have seen for several years, is supported by 300-millimeter.
We'll actually give an update to that in our February capital management call on what the precise numbers are, but that revenue continues to grow on 300-millimeter, and we continue to see the benefit.
So thank you for that question, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question. You've had for several quarters strength in automotive and industrial, and that continued in the quarter you just reported. In the outlook, I'm wondering if there's any change in terms of the relative strengths of your expected results by end market?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes – well as you know, we don't provide color below the top line, but certainly if there was anything significant there, we'd call out. And I can tell you there isn't anything significant. And I think if you look at that strength inside of industrial and automotive, I think as we look at third quarter, as it has for some time, that strength has been very broad based.
So, we've got 14 sectors inside of industrial. Most of those have been growing double digits for some time. We continue to direct our investments across those 14, so it's a very intentional investment and return. Same thing in automotive. So we've got diversity across five different sectors. All five of those are contributing to growth. And that diversity is across the product lines, it's across geographies. So we feel really good about that strength. Do you have a follow-on?
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thanks, Dave. I do. One more. We're aware that there's been a change in compensation to distributors. It's been pretty well publicized, I think, relative to paying them for demand – so-called demand creation. I'm wondering if there are still benefits to be made by TI, if there was anything squeezed out in the quarter just reported or anything that's still on the come, either in December or beyond from that change in sort of how you work with distribution. Thank you.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. So again, we don't – we no longer do pay for demand creation. As you indicated, distributors of course will continue to play a role in order fulfillment for our customers. So those relationships have been evolving, especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to strengthen. So as I mentioned earlier, even in this call, that is a unique advantage and includes both ti.com and the size and skill of our sales and apps team.
So those changes began implementation three years ago, for any accounts where we had direct TI resources. That represented about 80% of the TAM. And then later last year, we implemented changes with the remaining 20%. So I'd say a good portion of that is worked through, and it's not significant enough that it's going to make any of these earnings conference calls. So we just continue to invest in our demand creation activities, and we feel really good about the results that that is producing.
So with that, I think we've got time for one more call. Operator?

And that'll come from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
Great.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Hi, Romit.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
Hey, Dave. How are you?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Great.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
I just wanted to ask about the revenue growth, if you look at sort of growth over the last 12 months. I mean semiconductor demand, it just seems like there's a resurgence here. We certainly see that looking at the performance of your Analog and Embedded businesses. And that it's more than just – it's coming from more than just consumer confidence and how they're managing inventories. And I'm just curious, if you look at the performance of Analog and Embedded over the last 12 months, has it changed your outlook for the long-term growth of the company?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yeah, I don't think so, Romit. I think that we're fortunate that we've got investments in capacity and we've got a product portfolio that is very, very diverse. It's rich in automotive and industrial, which are the best growing parts of the market. And I don't think that that changes our outlook over the long term. And the best signal that we get from customers are orders, so we're able to respond to those if things continue to strengthen and strengthen from here. And if they go the other way, we've got a playbook ready to go if that were to happen. So do you have a follow-on?
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet
Yeah. I mean you talked about automotive, and one of the things that we see is that this shift to electric vehicles has a lot of momentum and that with electric powertrains, we could see demand for power semiconductors accelerate. And I was just curious how you guys think about the opportunity in electric vehicles. Is that a sub-segment that TI is uniquely positioned for?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yeah. I think that our investments in automotive are really directed across five different sectors. So powertrain is one of them, which is primarily EV. So, but if you look at the other spaces like infotainment cluster, passive safety, ADAS or advanced driver assist systems, and body electronics and lighting, we're very intentionally directing our investments across those areas.
So certainly as EVs become a higher mix of units that are sold on an annual basis, we'll benefit from that, but we're not dependent on it. And I think if I bring you back to our four competitive advantages, just that diversity and longevity. We'll benefit from ADAS systems being deployed and as the industry marches forward to autonomous driving or the mix of EVs.
Those are things we'll benefit from, but our business model isn't dependent on them. So we're real excited with the diversity of design wins that we have there, and we think we've got a lot of runway there as well as inside of industrial.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
So with that, we'll wrap up tonight's call, and thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded.
At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter '17 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI’s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I’ll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continue to strengthen in the industrial market.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 18% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 15% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.03. With that backdrop, I’ll now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI’s business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $917 million. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.0 billion, and free cash flow margin was 28.5% of revenue.
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output. We believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned 4.1 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 18% primarily due to growth in power and signal chain each of through about the same amount, high volume also grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 15% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers by about the same amount. In our other segment, revenue declined $60 million from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC and the move of royalties to OI&E beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
Now, I’ll provide some insight into this quarter’s revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth as most factors grew double digit. Personal electronics grew while results vary by customer. Lastly, communications equipment grew and enterprise systems was about even.
We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets which for the end markets where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they will provide diversity and longevity of products which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.37 billion or 64.3% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 300 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $812 million and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.3% of revenue, which is in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.
Operating profit was $1.48 billion, or 40.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 31% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 44.7%, up from 38.2% a year ago. And for Embedded Processing was 31.2%, up from 25.4% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enabled both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $1.06 billion or $1.03 per share, which included $28 million discrete tax benefit above what we expected.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $917 million in the quarter. You will see that while net income was significantly higher than a year ago, that increase was more than offset by a higher tax payment that was driven by our outlook for higher profitability this year. Inventory days were 133, even with our year ago and within our range.
Capital expenditures were $151 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis cash flow from operations was $4.56 billion. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $527 million or about 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.04 billion or 28.5% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.
In the second quarter, we paid $498 million in dividends and repurchased $650 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.15 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $4.05 billion.
Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.88 billion in dividends. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.2% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. This combine returns of dividend and repurchases demonstrate our confidence in our business model and commitment to return excess cash to our owners.
In the quarter we retired $375million of debt and year-to-date, we have retired $625 million. In addition, we issue $600 million in debt in two branches, $300 million each in four year and seven year notes. This leads total debt of $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of cash and short-term investment, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
Turning to our outlook for third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.04 to $1.19, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit.
Our annual operating tax rate for 2017 is now about 31%, compared with our prior expectations of above 30% due to our outlook for higher profitability this year. This annual operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and it's what you will need to use at the starting point for your longer term model.
Next, we're assuming discrete free tax items of about $20 million and $10 million in the third and fourth quarter of 2017 respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rate which include discrete tax items translate to about 29% and 30% in the third and fourth quarter respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models.
I will also remind analyst who are beginning to work with 2018 model that we would expect the discrete tax benefit in 1Q '18 to be higher than what we’re projecting for the third and fourth quarter of 2017, but lower than 1Q '17. To estimate the 2018 annual operating tax rate start with 2017 PDP tax of 31% than apply a 35% tax rate to any incremental profit. Then model discrete tax benefits by quarter, knowing that first quarter is expected to be higher than the others.
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long-term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

2017-07-25,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst
This is Jerald, on behalf of Ross. Just one question from me. You detailed how your end markets change year-on-year. Could you provide some details on how you estimate they change quarter-on-quarter?
Rafael Lizardi
Sure, Jerald. For automotive, basically, it increased sequentially with all sectors growing. Industrial, again, we saw a very broad based growth across the sectors and overall it also increased. Personal electronics increased with most sectors growing. Communications equipment was about even sequentially and enterprise systems are showing also good growth. Do you have a follow-on?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, sure. So you talked in the past about R&D potential is being a little bit elevated in near term now you guys came in further to our model for the quarter. How much longer could R&D be elevated in order to invest in the business?
Dave Pahl
I'll take that first. I would point out that I know you are asking about R&D, but let me address it from on OpEx standpoint. We look at that OpEx as a model and our model is turning to be between 20% and 30% of revenue I mean stable times to be at the lower half of that in fact that's why we've been in the last 2.5 years here so, 23 to 22, now we are running at 22% of revenue and again in stable times we think we can operate there.
Now, inside of that they are both in R&D and actually in SG&A, we have various investments that are strengthening our competitive advantages on the R&D front. We continue to focus on industrial and automotive to broad -- continue broaden portfolio. On the SG&A side, we invested on to increase the reach of our channels ci.com in particular we are thinking that we are going to continue to make those investments to strengthen the Company.
Rafael Lizardi
Okay, great and we will go to our next caller please.
Operator
We will go now to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Adam Gonzalez
Hi, thanks, this is Adam Gonzalez on for Vivek. First question, maybe could you contrast auto demands now versus say maybe six months ago? Anyhow industrial is an even larger market where you guys even though auto tends to get all your attention. Just wondering, did it correlate at all? Can industrial offset any potential demand fluctuations in autos? Thanks and have follow-up.
Dave Pahl
Sure, yes. So, the strength that we've seen inside of automotive is something that we've seen for probably greater than four years now. So, I'd attribute that to our early focus on that market, the breadth of our technologies and really just the overall diversity of our position. We’ve got five sectors inside of automotive that we are in investing in. So that includes infotainment safety systems, ADAS or advance driver assist systems, power train, which includes EV and hybrid and body electronics and lighting. So we are seeing good growth across those comms vectors that sit inside of the automotive market.
And really also diversity, across sub-system suppliers, across car companies, across geographical regions, so we feel really good about that, very similar story inside of industrial very broad-based growth. I won’t to speak to whether they'll be connected through economic cycles are not, but both do have increasing content. So, I’d be a little cautious to think that increasing content could offset correction that we may see in a near-term in any one given quarter or even in any one given year. But we believe that there will be more content there over the long-term when you’re looking five and 10 years and that’s why our investments are higher today. Do you have a follow on?
Adam Gonzalez
My second question is more on your free cash flow growth. I’m just curious why if you look at on a trailing 12-month basis, why free cash flow hasn't grown year-on-year despite your core NOI embedded businesses growing into low double-digit range? And what’s the catalyst for maybe getting that back to the higher single-digit maybe low double-digit range? Thanks.
RafaelLizardi
Yes, thanks for -- this is Rafael. Thanks for a chance to clarify that. First, in any given quarter, you're going to have puts and takes on free cash flow -- on in line with the P&L, but particularly on the cash flow -- on the cash flow statement. In this particular quarter and also on a trailing 12-month basis, but what you see there is we had an increased tax payment in 2Q ’17, that was primarily due to our outlook for higher profitability this year.
Dave Pahl
Okay. And we’ll go through the next caller please.
Operator
We will take our next question from Chris Danely with Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- excuse me with Citigroup.
Chris Danely
I had a question on gross margin. So your revenue is basically back to it was in the third, well I guess little bit higher than it was in the third quarter last year, but the gross margins are 230 basis points higher. Can you just kind of give us the reasons why they are higher? And then what would be the gross margin drivers going forward?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, sure. I'll be happy to address that. So, our gross margins in second quarter of ’17 ended at 64.3% and that was 300 basis points higher than in the same quarter last year. And as you reflect the quality of our product portfolio, as we continue to focus on automotive and industrial, but also the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy and as you know, we have the unique advantage of having 300 millimeter factory that at the chip level provides 40% cost advantage. As of 2016, we had about 2.5 billion of our revenue running to 300 millimeter and as we continue to grow the Company, and in this case the Analog in particular, and that growth primarily runs through 300 millimeter then we're going to accrue that benefit over and over and it's a cumulative benefit that really yield some nice results. Through the gross margin line about in more important to their free cash flow and free cash flow for share to for the owner of the Company.
Dave Pahl
Do you have follow-up, Chris?
Chris Danely
Another thing that's going on out there at least some of your competitors have talked about their lead time extending. Is that happening at all at TI?
Rafael Lizardi
Chris, I described our lead times continuing to remain stable, if we do have pocket where we got a processor package, supply tightness, but we’re aggressively working those. But overall our lead times continue to remain stable.
Dave Pahl
Okay thank. We'll go to go the next caller.
Operator
We will go next to William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein
It's sort of a follow-up to the last one. We’ve heard quite a bit about shortages for complimentary products SME's in particular on the faster aside. And I'm hoping you find out, if TI is seeing any sort of tapping of its growth opportunities because customers are certainly not going to order, parts if you think they can get a full kit from all their supplier racing that dynamic play at all.
Rafael Lizardi
I would say in general, I'm not sure we could see that if that was there. But I'll just remind you that about 60% of our revenues are on consignment, so we got no inventory of our products sitting in front of the customer's production line that they owned. We may have position that one of our balance sheet and same thing with distributors but we actually do get demand forecast from them and those often times will be several months out, sometime even as far as six months out. And that doesn’t mean that they can't change. And I would say for that where we do have very good visibility and won't see anything unusual going on inside of there, no one usual expedites or cancellations or those types of things. Do you have follow on?
William Stein
Maybe you could comment on order linearity through the quarter and book to bill?
Rafael Lizardi
Sure, so again, I’ll make the comment that we’ve got 60% of our revenues on consignment, so there we actually don’t have orders or backlogs, we only see that those demand forecast. So book to bill is less helpful inside of that but orders if you look at through the month, they were strong overall and they did accelerate as we went through the quarter and into the month of June. Book to bill overall was 1.06. So and with that, we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur
Solid job on the quarterly execution margin expansion on the outlook, clearly macro dimensions are strong in yearend markets similar to our last quarter. I'm just wondering, if you could just talk about some of the dimensions from a geographic perspective. I think last quarter you guys saw year-over-year growth in of geographies, wondering, if you can just provide us with some details on the June quarter?
Rafael Lizardi
Sure. Harlan. Year-over-year revenue was up in all regions so Asia, Europe and the U.S. and Japan on a year-over-year basis and that was true additionally on a sequential basis. So we saw growth very really across the board there and just as a reminder some of those as well some don’t that the we attract our revenue on where we ship it, so it's not where that product is ultimately keeps in as so we may ship in to a car manufacturer or Tier 1 car manufacturer in Europe and -that's car may end-up and be sold in China as an example. So, it's really is not a good look through for end consumption by market. Do you have a follow-on?
Harlan Sur
Yes, I do. Thanks for the color there. So on embedded strong year-over-year growth in sales. I think your operating profitability was up something like almost 600 basis points year-over-year. Is this mostly leveraged on the OpEx as you drive revenue growth? Or are there some positive mix benefit? And I'm not sure for example if some of your processes solution is going into automotive carry like higher gross margin profile?
Rafael Lizardi
Well, this is Rafael. What I would tell you that the driver the main driver of what you are seeing near is the revenue growth as we have a over a number of years now we've refocused our investments in embedded and now that really being up very nicely. They have embedded has a quite a bit of our investment there is in automotive and industrial just like it is in Analog and then those as we have said those are the best markets and there is that's giving very nice results.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thank you, Harlan, and will go to our next caller please.
Operator
We will take our next question from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani
I guess two questions from me as well. First off historically that you've always talked about this 30 to 40 basis points of share gained actually on an annual basis. I'm just wondering given the inflection of R&D high over the last several quarters now, should we start to think about share gains potentially accelerating or share gains happening in place where the margin profile is much richer? And when do you see those benefits transfer for you guys on the revenue line?
Dave Pahl
Well, I'll take a shot at that and if Rafael wants to add something, he can jump in. I would just say that as we look and allocate R&D, worth allocating those to the best projects that we can find one so that we are going to produce, it get designed into the most customers into the most market and have longevity of revenue. And really mostly that's about finding better opportunities to invest in and trying to just settle the number of products as an example that we're doing. But we have found more opportunities to make investments its things as our products will live longer and repurpose products into adjacent markets that we found opportunities to be able to do that.
So and I think just in general the quality of the opportunity share doesn’t shift very quickly. And so we are not penciling in an inflection point inside of our revenue. But when you look at our competitive advantages and -- I just say, just as a reminder, all four those together and the investments that we are making, and that includes the manufacturing and technology, the most visible one there is the 300 millimeter advantage that we have. The broader portfolio and just the tens of thousands of products that we’ve got the opportunity to sell more products to customers the reach of the channel market including ti.com that Rafael had mentioned earlier as well as our sales force. And then just the diverse in line with positions, all those working together, I think this is confidence that in the -- in the future that we can continue to gain share in that range 30, 40 basis points.
Rafael Lizardi
The only thing, I would add is, as you know we talk about it quite a bit we’ve been focusing on our industrial for quite some time now because they’ll start advance, there’s kind of benchmark that they have the highest semiconductor content growth. And we are confident that will continue to have that for -- for many years to come. So as of the end of last year 51% of our – of our revenue was automotive and industrial and obviously with the growth we are seeing year-to-date that number appears to be picking up that percentage. So that numbers increases and we continue drive in a performance on those two segments. Then mathematically overall revenue will do better.
Dave Pahl
Amit, do you have follow-on?
Amit Daryanani
I do and hopefully I don’t jinx the strength right now. But last four quarters I think all you guys have been pretty much at the high end of our revenue guide that you guys initially provide. Is there a change in the way you provide guide? Or you rolled up the revenue forecast that things have actually ended up at the high for four quarters in a row? Or is it just happened to be the case?
Rafael Lizardi
It’s really the later, when we look at the out quarter, again we’ve got 60% of the revenues that we don’t have patterns to look at, but we can actually seeing the demand patterns that that our customers have. And that can move in both directions pretty quickly, right. So even though we got great visibility there, things can strengthen or we can very quickly on us. But we do have very, very good visibility for that 50% of our revenue. And rest of that we look at, we do look at the backlog, we look at order patterns and our sales teams provide forecast as well. So, we go through our bottoms up and tops down approach. So, the revenue guidance that we gave for the third quarter is our best estimate of what we think we’ll do. Okay.
Dave Pahl
Okay, thank you, Amit. And we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We’ll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Rafael, I apologize if I missed this. But, what I think just talk a little bit about OpEx trends going into the September quarter, typically, it’s a seasonally down quarter for OpEx. I’m just kind of curious, is that how we should be thinking about modeling it this September? Or are there some incentive or variable bonus offset that might actually have OpEx flat or up sequentially?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, I’ll be happy to add some clarity on that. As you know, we don’t guide specifically on OpEx or GPM, any line for that matter, matter other than revenue and EPS. But on OpEx -- and I should say, on OpEx we focus on the model, the 20% to 30%. And we’ve been operating in the lower half of that. So we like, you guys to think a lot that way. I would tell you though if we had anything unusual going on an OpEx, we would point that out second to third and we do not. And we also don’t have anything like vacation or compensation adjustment that sometimes or we do see fourth to first for example. We do not have that going on in a second to third concession.
Dave Pahl
Just add to that when you look at our history we had some restructuring in the last few third quarters that you may have seen that transition that Rafael stated. There is not a seasonal impact you see inside the third quarter typically. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer
Dave, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the auto market because clearly over the last several year, it's been one of the better semis, but there have been some sort of mix data points, starts decelerating, you've seen some auto manufactures actually coming forecast in the back half of the year. So I guess how do you think about kind of solid unit growth versus content growth? And how is the visibility there? And are you seeing things that others might have highlighted last week on their conference call?
Dave Pahl
Yes, so the one thing that been clear, our business has grown a very strong for four years plus now, so and that’s really due to the early investments that we had made inside of this market, we continue to make. And again we're trying to ensure that we're making those investments as broad as we can, so we're not ending on one particular technology or one type of portion of that demand that’s increasing.
And clearly I don’t think it's well know that actually content has grown faster inside auto's and if you go down into a showroom you can see that pretty clearly in any car today versus even just a few years ago. So we’re confident that that trend will continue and we've also seen the announcements, like you've mentioned that some car companies have reduced their bill plan, we certainly continue to monitor those markets overall but we're confident in our long-term position there and we will continue to make those investments. Okay thank you John and we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
We will now to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Sorry about that straddling two calls and I apologize if this has been answered already. In the reported quarter, did the upside comp versus your expectations going into the quarter?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, Ambrish, it was -- things were pretty strong, really across the board. So, we saw growth really in most market, most geographies and even lot of the sub sectors inside of automotive and industrial.
Dave Pahl
And with that, three quarters of our growth came from industrial and automotive. So that just shows you how strong those were.
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes, I did Dave, and this is you're kind enough always when we have this topic comes up every couple of quarters and not surprisingly we're in an economic expansion for a while now, top of the cycle. You have metrics that you look out with your cancellations, booking and so you share them quite frequently with us. So where are we, where is TI's on those metrics Dave. Thank you.
Dave Pahl
I would say that if you look again inside of distribution, our inventory there remains at about four weeks is actually down sequentially and down from a year-ago. Our visibility in the customers inventory is of course very depending on if for on consignment or not so with our consigned OEMs were not thinking things that's unusual there such as expedite that would suggest that we have an issue, and off course our visibility and the inventory beyond with customers manufacturing operations is very little overall, so again cancellations remained low lead times continues to remain steady. So all of those metrics I think really our very similar to what we saw 90-days ago. So I think you Ambrish and I think we have time for one more call.
Operator
We will go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley Financials.
Craig Ellis
I wanted to come back on the gross margin point so congratulations on getting to 64% in the quarter. When I look at the incremental for the quarter, it was 79%, which is above the 68% to 69% level but that it had been for the last five or six quarters, not unprecedented but look like a step-up. Is that something we should interpret as being more sustainable? Or were there some either mix items or other lumpy 300 million transition items that contributed to be atypical surge in the quarter?
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, this is Rafael. Well, we would tell you any given quarter the follow through will be a little different. In our company the size of ours are there is just a lot of puts and takes inside this big P&L the more important thing to remember is that we have some fundamental structural drivers that are have increased our GPM percent and we think we are in a continue increasing our GPM percent for a forcible future. And those are the quality of their portfolio as we continue to focus on the best market that are more even an industrial and the diversity and possessions and long live possessions that we get with those where we invest our R&D today and we get the revenue for decades to come. And then the other piece is 300 millimeter Analog as stated earlier that is 40% more cost efficient than 200 millimeter. And that accurse me and you starting one part on that and then in the next part you started on 300 and the third part and the fourth part and you making it all a bigger percent in terms of your company's is running on 300 millimeter and it was only the 30% as of 2016 and the 30% of the capacity we have on 300 which used. So we have ample room to continue growing 300 millimeter and accrue benefits to the Company.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow on?
Craig Ellis
Yes, thank you. Just regarding the end market color you provided in response to earlier question Dave. Comps are going to be flattish quarter-on-quarter. Can you just what pressure maybe in terms of where that the Company stands with respect to how it's looking at comps from a strategic standpoint and where you see demand is as we look around and look at 4G infrastructure investments being made globally? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Sure. Yes, so comps equipment is 13% of our total revenue the viral or debt infrastructure will be sector inside of that which tends to take a lot of the calls it's more than half of that end market owned by itself so pricing more in the mid-single digits as a percentage of our revenue. And you know there I think when we look at incremental dollars of where we are investing. And if I refer you back to our capital management call that we get stay back in February, we talked about the fact that we wanted to increase incrementally dollars in both the industrial and automotive market because that’s where we believe the growth will be.
With communications equipment, I would say that we got some caveats depending on which business we are looking at. In Embedded, I would say that those investments are down versus where say where maybe five years ago. But on the same view inside of Analog, they're actually up because the some of the complexity that, that’s being developed inside of the radio.
So, we do believe that that market will continue to provide great opportunities for us for a very long period of time. But we just don’t believe that there is going to be significant growth, we don’t know if any carriers that want to take up the CapEx over the next 5 and 10 years, over a long period of time. So, thank you for that question, Greg and thank you all for joining us tonight. A replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments first quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded, and at this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with a weak year-ago quarter.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.97 which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance.
With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago.
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all three product lines, power, signal chain and high volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers by about the same amount. In our other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago, primarily due to a move of royalties to OI&E, which Rafael will explain later.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with a weak year-ago quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year-ago and sequential periods. And then lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, which are where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they will provide diversity and longevity of products which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio.
Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.14 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points.
Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue, and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.8% of revenue, in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.
Operating profit was $1.25 billion, or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners.
In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners.
Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12-month free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year on year for 52 consecutive quarters.
In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
Turning to our outlook for second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit.
Before moving to Q&A, there are three changes that I want to explain to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted a new GAAP standard that impacts the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our effective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impact. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance just as we did this quarter.
To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and it's what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer term models. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2017 respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates which include discrete tax items translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models.
If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter to quarter, particularly in first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete tax items as well as the retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com/ir. Hopefully providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard.
The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website
The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. They were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as other income and expense rather than in revenue as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results
Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

Thank you. At this time, we'll take our first question in the queue. This will be from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. From a product and end market perspective, it appears that demand is relatively broad based. I'm wondering if you can comment on demand by geographies. I'm assuming that that's also fairly broad based as well, but wanted to see if there were any regions which are exhibiting any weakness.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, Harlan. Yes, I would say that the demand was very broad based and included regionals. Year over year, revenue was up in Asia, Europe and the U.S. And revenue was about even in Japan from a year ago. You have a follow up?
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes, I do. Thanks for that. Auto, a solid market for the team last year with that end market up 23%. I think you mentioned that it's up double digits again in March. You've got a very diversified business here as well. There's been some concern around the global auto markets and the potential for a slowdown, given indications that production and/or demand after two solid years might start to slow. Just wanted to get the team's sense on the health of this market kind of near to midterm.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. I definitely, as we stated in the opening remarks, that we saw our demand for our products in automotive continued to be strong. And so like you said, we've built that business across a very diverse set of sectors. And in fact, we've got five sectors inside of automotive. So it's diverse not only in the products that we sell into, but it's diverse across customers, across geos. So we feel very good about our position in automotive.
And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think most people would put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1%, or a little more than 1% of the sales price of a car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year timeframe have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's we continue to invest in it, and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Thanks, Harlan.

We'll now move to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to ask about OpEx. Did that come in in line with your original plan for the quarter or was it different? And how should we think about the OpEx trajectory into Q2?
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. Thanks for the call. I'll handle that one. On OpEx, everything came in about as expected. What I would tell you, the way you want to think about OpEx, high level, we've talked about our model where we want to run OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenue and in stable markets at the lower end of that, the lower half. And that's exactly what we've been doing for the last couple of years. And in fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're just below that. So as you think forward, you should model us along those lines.
If you're thinking kind of on a tactical level first to second, I would remind you that second quarter does have three months of higher pay and benefit raises versus only two months in first quarter. So you may have some of that played in kind of similar to what happened last year, maybe a little less than that.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Yes, yes I do. On your capital management update from a month or two ago, you had given some indicators of where 300-millimeter loading was, but it only went up a little bit in 2016. I think it went from about $2.2 billion year over year to $2.5 billion, so maybe $300 million, suggesting a good amount of headroom left for that transition to continue. How should we expect that trajectory to evolve this year in 2017? Is it just dependent on growth? Is there volume in 200-millimeter that's ramping down as 300-millimeter is ramping up? Like how should we think about where that might end up exiting this year in a normal demand environment?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yeah, Stacy, in the capital management update, if you remember, we talked about the fact that we've put in place about $8 billion of 300-millimeter capacity. Last year we had, as you stated, about $2.5 billion, so we're in a great position to be able to support growth. And essentially, we've been releasing for sometime now really probably going back to 2010, almost all of our new Analog products to 300-millimeter.
So there's some exceptions to that, of course, on some older technologies that don't make sense to do, but the vast majority of them have been released there. So as you think about the Analog business growing, you can think of that incremental growth essentially being built on 300-millimeter. And if you look at last year, that came pretty close to what happened. So we had about $300 million of growth, so it's very consistent with that. So, thank you, Stacy, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

We'll now move to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, you were kind enough in your prepared comments to go through end markets in the March quarter on a year over year basis. I think the comm equipment was the only market you gave sequential color. I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit about the sequential growth into March. It was well above seasonal and sort of in the same vein, to your guidance in June, you're guiding below seasonal. So how should we think about that from an end market perspective?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Okay. So a couple of things. We thought the comms equipment market has been choppy in recent past, so we thought that that would be helpful, and that's why we provided it. If I'd just comment on the other markets sequentially, automotive market, as we said, continued to be strong. It increased with most of the sectors growing. Industrial demand was strong across almost every sector that we ship into. And just as a reminder, we've got 14 different sectors there. I won't put everybody to sleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that and literally hundreds of end equipment that fit inside of that. So it's very, very broad based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was about even.
So, when we look at our guidance for second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues would be flat. The high end of the guidance suggests that it would be up 9%. And if you look at that, John, on a year on year basis, the low end would be up 4% and the high end would be up 13%. So we think that that's fairly robust growth inside of the second quarter. So you have a follow-on, John?
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yes, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-on, I might have missed this and I apologize, but did you give an orders number for the quarter? And just in general, how are lead times either of your products or your competitors' products, because there has been some buzz that perhaps lead times within the industry are starting to stretch out?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. So orders were up 14% year on year to $3.5 billion. They were up about 2% sequentially. And I think from a lead time standpoint, our lead times have remained stable. And just as important as that, our on-time delivery metrics also remain very high. So our shipping to our commitments that we make to customers remain very high. So with that said, we do have some isolated process and package combinations where lead times have stretched, but we've worked very aggressively on those. So we're very pleased with where we are to be able to keep ahead of demand. Well thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll now move to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on inventory, Dave. I guess exiting the quarter, inventory days were at 132 days, toward the high end of your guided range. How comfortable are you with that level? And what are you seeing in terms of the distribution channel?
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, we are – well, I'll answer our inventory days and then I'll let Dave comment on the disti channel. But we're comfortable with our inventory days. It's well within our range. Always remember inventory days is a backwards looking metric, so what we have it there for is to support growth. And the other key point to remember is as we have focused our strategy more on industrial, automotive and on catalog type of parts, the risk of obsolescence on this part is really minimal. So it makes sense from a longer-term standpoint to have that inventory available to support revenue growth.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, and from a disti standpoint, Toshiya, we saw our inventory days kind of remain near their current levels, at four weeks. That benefits from our consignment programs we have with our distributors. It actually was down sequentially, and it was down from a year ago. So we think that those are in good shape. Do you have a follow-on?
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A. You guys have been pretty consistent in the past, and you've pointed to valuation and the lack of opportunities as reasons to stay sidelined, but was hoping you could potentially give us an update there, if any changes.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, I'd be happy to comment. The update is no change. It's the same strategy for M&A. We looked at – we're always considering options and looking at things, but it has to be an opportunity that is focused on industrial, it's focused on automotive, catalog type of parts, Analog catalog. So it has to be a good strategic fit from that standpoint. But then the other component that has to be there is that the numbers have to make sense. So when we have both of those combinations, then we are willing to move forward on considering that further.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Thank you, Toshiya. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

Thank you. We'll move now to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Couple questions from me as well. I guess one, fairly impressive growth in the Analog side. I think it was up like 20% year over year. Is there a way to think about the growth in the segment excluding the consumer side, where I think you may have had somewhat easier comps? Just trying to get a sense of what the baseline number could be on Analog as you go through the year.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. I think first of all, let me just make a comment at the company level. We talked about that the demand was driven from the strength that we saw in the industrial market as well as automotive. That represented about 70% of the growth, and certainly we did benefit and see growth inside of personal electronics off of the easy compare, as we all remember a year ago that we were working through an inventory correction in that particular end market. So the great news is that's very consistent with what we saw inside of Analog, and so the growth is very, very broad based. So we've got contributions from the industrial market, contributions from the automotive market, and as well as we did see contributions from the personal electronics market. So do you have a follow-on?
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
I do. I guess just in the automotive segment, could you just talk about if there's a way to think about maybe what percent of your auto revenues today are infotainment-centric versus more mandate driven around fuel efficiency or battery management or safety? And is there a way to think about the geographic split in the auto business as well? Thank you.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yeah, thanks. That's a great question, Amit, and thanks for the opportunity to comment on it. You know, I think that the great thing that we've been trying to do, or the thing that we've been trying to do and why we're happy with the results, is that our automotive business isn't just built on just either infotainment or an ADAS business. It really is broad based. So when we look at kind of the order of the sizes of those business, the infotainment is the largest. Safety systems is the second, followed by advanced driver assist systems, then power train, which includes hybrid and electric and then body, electronics and lighting.
So, and if you dive into any one of those areas, it's not dominated by one technology or one product. And we've got more than half of our 60 to 70 product lines that ship products into the automotive business. So we're very diverse from a product standpoint. We're also very diverse from a geography standpoint as well, so we're really seeing a benefit and additional revenue growth from all of the geos. So thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

At this time, we'll move to C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Apologies for, I guess first question, I got on a little bit late, so just have a point of clarification. In terms of the royalty commentary, the $30 million, was that included for Q1 as well? So net-net with that, top line would have been $30 million in gross margin, 100% of that $30 million better?
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
And then from here, we should be using that same amount?
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
So the change in royalties was included in our guidance, meaning that the royalties were in other income and expense, just like how they came in in results. And on a go-forward basis, they will stay in other income and expense. So for modeling purposes, you can look at how that other income and expense line came in and then model it similar to that on a go-forward basis.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Thank you. And I guess as a follow up, can you walk through some of the work that you're doing on the gross margin side? It sounds like internally, the 75% is not enough and you want to take that higher. And would love to hear what you're working on, and I'm assuming that includes not only front end but back end manufacturing and would love to get an update there, if you could.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, sure. As you think of the company on a go forward basis, the biggest driver of our gross margin is revenue, revenue growth. And that's what we're focused on industrial and automotive. Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the constant growth of semiconductors in those spaces.
Now, beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300 millimeter. As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage, and that's because the cost of the chip is significantly less. In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter. So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin but more importantly, higher free cash flow, And then free cash flow per share that we can return to the owners of the company.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Okay. Thank you, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And the next question will be Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey. Thanks, guys. I'm going to use up my first question on just a couple of revenue clarifications. So in response to an earlier question on the, I guess the stronger than expected revenue, so are you telling us that your automotive business was responsible for the upside in Q1 on revenue and comm was a little weak? And then on the Q2 guide, you're basically guiding up like 4.5%. That's below seasonality and also below what you guided sequentially for last year. So you're not seeing any weakness or no change in the Q2 forecasts over the last like month?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. So the first is that our revenue came inside of our guidance, and so we didn't really have any surprises there. If you look at all of the businesses and if you look at the end markets, we really saw strength across the board, Chris. So there really wasn't an area that we would point to that singularly drove the revenues in the quarter or from the midpoint of the guidance, if you will. So very broad based overall. And then secondly, again, I think going back to John's question, when we look at our sequential growth rates of kind of the low end of flat to up 9% or on a year on year basis of 4% to 13%, we think that that's a pretty strong second quarter. So do you have a follow-on?
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yes. Just a longer-term question. I think you've talked about currently being outfitted for somewhere around $18 billion in revenue capacity. What sort of revenue level would you start to need to order more equipment? I assume you wouldn't wait until you're 100% utilized before you start to put those orders in. Is it 90% utilization, 95%? Maybe give us some color there.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Well, I'll give you some color and then I'll let Dave chime in. But, we think of our strategy, as stated in the capital management strategy for many years, is that we want to add capacity well ahead of demand. And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet. This capacity we can buy. When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow. So we're thinking longer term, 10, 15 years out when we're making capacity decisions.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, and I'll just add, Chris, like you pointed out, we had a little over $13 billion in revenue last year. We've got just under about $6 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity. We have open 200-millimeter capacity inside of that footprint. So we've got plenty of room to grow for some time. But like Rafael said, if we had the opportunity tomorrow to buy another wafer fab or make a large purchase and it was at the right price, we'd make that move, because it is an asymmetrical bet. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We'll now move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and maybe I'll ask the same related question here. When you look at the guidance, well actually if you just look at the overall business, you're not the only ones seeing double digit year over year growth in all of your businesses. Even if you've taken out personal electronics, the rest of the business is up strong. And the commentary actually suggests that it remains strong. So I guess kind of two parts here.
One, how do you foot the gap between what, I know there is content gains in semis, but between what some of the end markets are doing, what's your perspective as you look out the rest of the year? Do you think the semi market is a little ahead of itself? And then I guess as you look at your June guidance, did you guys apply any sort of conservatism to that guidance to account for anything along those lines?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, so I think if you walk through the end markets, Blayne, as we've commented, automotive has remained strong. You saw that that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just one OEM or one car model or one end market. So it's very, very diverse, and we feel good about that positioning.
When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We already talked about the personal electronics markets and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, and as you pointed out, is broad based. Others are seeing it as well.
So kind of on the other thing is, to your question, are we double ordering or seeing inventories build. I'd just make the comment that overall the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So, we have no indications that inventories are growing or double ordering, but I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see.
I mentioned earlier our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility into distribution inventory, and as I commented earlier, that remains steady, about four weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's in real good shape.
Our visibility into customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, actually our inventory, and they pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that that would suggest that there's an issue overall.
And our visibility into inventory, of course beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course is very low. So, as we have been doing for a long time with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focused on keeping lead times steady, and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence, that they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great and I apologize. I missed the very beginning, so if you already said this, I apologize. But in terms of your guidance, I kind of get gross margins flattish, maybe down a little bit. I just wanted to make sure that that's the right range.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
The way I would comment on that is, we have said before that our revenues fall through between 70% and 75%. So if you do that math on a sequential basis, you'll get somewhere close to where you need to be.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Okay. Thank you. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
I'm sorry. We'll take a question now from David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. You talked about how your investment priorities were in industrial and automotive. Can you give us some idea within automotive, are there specific types of products or specific capabilities that you're directing your investments at?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, David. As I mentioned before, we're very intentionally trying to make investments across a very broad number of areas. So they include things that are very popular like ADAS systems and infotainment systems, but also embody electronics and lighting. So we've commented before that that includes areas like turn signals. There's a couple of dollars of content in an LED turn signal and our sales teams get pretty excited about things like that. But also sensors on door handles and inside of the infotainment system, the touch buttons to control the AC or the audio system, haptic systems that may sit inside of the steering wheel or in driver's seats, and LED lighting inside of a car. There's a lot of areas. So we're really trying to direct that investment to be very, very broad based. Do you have a follow-on, David?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. Well, similarly for industrial, you mentioned the 14 areas you were going to bore us with. Are there any additional areas on top of the 14 that you will be able to go into because of your investments?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, so I'll resist the temptation to bore you and run you through those. But if I just take one like Medical, as an example, that sits inside of there, there's literally hundreds of end equipment that will sit inside of medical. And if you think of at the high end, there may be a magnetic resonance imaging machine that may sell for millions of dollars, and then all the way down at the other end, you have a blood glucose meter that may sell for less than $50. So we actually have over 100 different end equipments that will sit inside of a sector like medical, and as we make investments, we look to funnel those investments, not just in one area like something like factory automation and control, as an example. We really want to funnel those investments on a very broad basis. So thank you, David, and we can go to the next caller, please.

We'll now move to Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes. Thank you. My first question on lead times. So you mentioned your lead times are very stable. You're maybe seeing some stretch in certain specific areas. But if you look at the general environment, does it feel like the supply chain is overly nervous about getting product, or does it feel like it's pretty controlled?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, Tore. Again, I can really only speak for what we see and what we're doing. And again, I think we're advantaged because we've got a large portion of our revenues on consignment, so we're actually controlling that inventory up and to the point that it gets pulled. We also, for many customers, we'll get long-term forecasts. Those consignment forecasts literally sometimes can be on an hourly basis, but certainly on a daily or weekly basis and typically go out for six months in some cases. Now that doesn't mean that they can't change very quickly, and we've seen that before in the past and they can strengthen or weaken and that usually happens very quickly. So again, our lead times are remaining very stable besides those isolated areas that we're working very aggressively to fix. The vast majority of our products remain stable. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes. That's very helpful. As a follow up, I think you mentioned industrial strengthening. So I assume that means it's going to be up more in June than it was in March. And again, is that strength broad based, or is there any region that's waking up a little bit more than others? And I'm especially thinking about China, because there's been some recent weakness there. I'm just wondering if that region is holding up as well in industrial.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yeah, Tore, the comment was around the quarter that we reported, and we've seen industrial strengthen now for a number of quarters in a row. Our guidance for the second quarter, we just provide the top level and EPS. If there is anything that's unusual going on in an end market, we always provide that color to be helpful. And we haven't had to provide that obviously for second quarter. So thank you, and I think we've got time for one more caller, please.

The question will be from with Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question on R&D and as it relates to OpEx. Rafael, you kind of articulated that the OpEx will be in the band that you have provided in the past, so no change there. But R&D on a year over year basis in absolute dollars has been growing, and in your last filing, you mentioned that you would be reallocating from manufacturing as well as SG&A into R&D. So just kind of like a two-part question is, one, what should be the trajectory of R&D as we model through the year? And then kind of related to that, qualitatively if you could help us understand where the focus is for the R&D investment. Thank you.
Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes. Let me address the second part of that question first. That's clear, we've been focusing on industrial and on automotive. That's where we have been biasing our investments for a number of years, and that's why we're getting strong results in both of those end markets. Now over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive, so those investments are paying off.
On your first part of your question, I would take you back to my earlier comments. We like, our stated goal or model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investments, investments in sales, in the sales force, in ti.com, and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages. So OpEx 20% to 30% in stable times, in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%, and we have been running like that for now 27 months. So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx. Dave, you want to add?
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Yes, I'll just add, Ambrish. As you know, when we look at making investments, whether it's in R&D or in OpEx, as we pointed out in our capital management presentation that we gave earlier, investing in the businesses is a top priority. So, and what we're try to do, as Rafael indicated by market, but we also want to strengthen our four competitive advantages.
So those include the first one which is manufacturing and technology, ensuring that we're developing great process technologies and strengthening our position with 300-millimeter. The breadth of the portfolio is the second, and we've talked about that a lot and how that plays out through industrial and automotive. The third is the reach of our marketing channels and strengthening that, and that continues to be our investments in ti.com as well as how that's coupled with our sales force and apps teams. And then we want all those things to lead to the diversity and longevity, and that will lead to good free cash flow per share growth, and that's really what we want to do. Did you have a follow-up?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
No, that was it. Thank you very much.
David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated
Okay. Well thank you all for joining us tonight and a replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments’ 4Q'16 and 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead.
David Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter '16 and 2016 earnings conference call. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our Web site at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web, and can be accessed through our Web site. A replay will be available through the Web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from managements’ current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. Also with me is Rafael Lizardi, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, February 1st. Rafael joined TI in 2001, and was named Vice President in 2010, followed by Corporate Controller in 2012. He holds a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Military Academy of West Point, and Masters in Business of Administration from Stanford University.
As you know, Kevin, who has been our CFO for 13 years, plans to retire later this year. During his tenure as CFO, TI's free cash flow per share has grown in average of 13% annually. Our dividend has increased by a factor of 24%, and our share count has been reduced by 42%. We’ve all benefitted and learned a lot from his disciplined financial management and his commitment to ensure that owners of TI's shares get a good return on their investment. Kevin will continue to be with TI until October 2017 to transition his duties between himself and Rafael.
I don’t want to get too sentimental, but as this is Kevin's final earnings call, I want to say what a pleasure it's been for me to know and to work with him. TI is clearly a better Company because of his leadership. I will say he has an outstanding successor. I worked with Rafael for the past decade, and look forward to continue to work with him in his new role as CFO.
With that, before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that’s important to calendars. We plan to hold a call to update our capital management strategy on February 8th at 10:00 AM Central time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will provide some insight into our strategy. In today's earnings call, Rafael, will cover the capital management portion of our prepared remarks and Kevin and I will cover the rest.
Now, let's start with the quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7% from a year-ago, as demand for our products remained strong in the automotive market. The improvement we saw in the third quarter in the industrial market continues. Demand in personal electronics market was down slightly from a year-ago. I'll elaborate more on our end markets in a few moments.
In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 10% and Embedded Processing grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $1.02, and included $0.14 for items that were not in our original guidance for the quarter. With that back-drop, I will now provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TIs business model.
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-months period was $4.1 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago. We continue to benefit from an improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. In 2016, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and repurchases.
Turning to our segments, Analog revenue grew 10% from the year ago quarter. Revenue increased due to power management, high-performance Analog, and Silicon Valley Analog. High-volume Analog in logic was about even. Embedded Processing increased 6% from the year ago quarter due to processors and micro-controllers. Connectivity also grew. In our other segment, revenues declined 9% from a year ago quarter due to royalties and custom ASIC products. DLP products and calculators were about even.
For the year, in total, Analog was up 2% and Embedded was up 8%. Combined, they grew 4% on broad-based growth and were 86% of TI’s revenue for the year. We’ve recently simplified the product lines inside our two business segments, Analog and Embedded. To align by product categories, our customers think about. Making it easier for customers to search and select products is becoming increasingly important in all of our markets, but particularly in industrial.
Analog is now comprised of three product lines instead of four. These are power, signal chain and high-volume Analog in logic. Embedded goes from three product lines to two. Connected MCU, which merges connectivity and micro-controllers and processors, which is essentially unchanged. All of these changes are at the product line levels. Nothing changes at the segment level. To help you understand this structure, for 2016 within our Analog business, power would have been about 45% of Analog revenue, signal chain would have been about 35% and high volume in Analog and logic would have been the remaining 20%.
Inside our embedded business, connected MCU would have been about 55% of embedded revenue with processors comprising the remaining 45%. Starting in our first quarter '17 earnings call, we’ll use these product lines in describing the performance of our business segments.
Now, let me describe our performance by end-market for 2016. This is a reminder we annually provide an estimate of TI’s revenue by end markets. We breakeven to six categories; industrial, automotive, personal electronics, where this includes products such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets and TVs, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other, which is primarily calculators.
Specifically, in 2016, industrial comprised 33% of our revenue, up 2 points from 2015. Automotive was 18% of our revenue, up 3 points. Personal electronics was 26%, down 4 points. Communications equipment and enterprise systems were 13% and 6% respectively, both year and to last year, while other was about 4%. We did not have a customer that was more than 10% of our revenue in 2016.
For those of you who have followed TI for several years, you know that we’ve been highly focused on a strategy where we’ve been allocating our capital and we’ve been driving initiatives to increase our market share and industrial and automotive. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they provide the diversity and longevity of products which translates to high terminal value of the portfolio.
In 2016, industrial and automotive combined made up 51% of TI’s revenue, up from 44% just two years ago. We have established momentum in these markets, but we are far from satisfied, and are continuing to make improvements, such as aligning our product lines in the way our customers search and select for TI products.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.
Kevin March
Thanks, Dave and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.13 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased to 400 basis points. Operating expenses were $754 million or 22.1% of revenue. Over the last 12 months, we’ve invested $1.37 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation.
Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which for the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Restructuring charges and other was $20 million net benefit, which includes a gain related to intellectual property agreement and a charge associated with realignment of our product lines, which Dave previously mentioned. Operating profit was $1.32 billion or 38.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 15% from the year-ago quarter.
Operating margin for Analog was 42.8%, up from 38.0% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 28.2%, an improvement of 480 basis points from year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Also, we signed several intellectual property agreements, which had total benefits of $228 million in the quarter. We recognize $188 million in other income and expense or OIE, and $40 million in the restructuring charges and other. Neither revenue nor gross profit was impacted by these agreements.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion or $1.02 per share, which included a $0.14 benefit for items not in our prior outlook. These included $0.14 benefit for several intellectual property agreements, one set tax benefit related to the new accounting standards for stock compensation, and $0.01 restructuring charge.
This quarter, we adopted a new GAAP standard that changes where we report tax consequences of employee stock compensation. When employee stock compensations are exercised or when restricted stock units test, either in excess tax benefit or deficiency maybe generated. The previous standard required that amount to be recognized in equity on the balance sheet. The new standard requires that amount to be recognized in incomes taxes on the income statement, impacting net income and EPS. In the fourth quarter 2016, this created a benefit of $0.01 per share and for the year a benefit of $0.13 per share. I’ll also note that this accounting standard increases the diluted share count calculation by about 5 million shares.
I’ll now ask Rafael to comment on our capital management results.
Rafael Lizardi
Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.39 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $110 million in the quarter. In 2016, cash flow from operations was $4.61 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $531 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. This includes the expansion of our 300 millimeter Analog capacity.
Free cash flow for the year was $4.08 billion or 30.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 6% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. And will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business, or returned to shareholders. Our intent overtime remains to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we received from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. This commitment is unchanged.
In the fourth quarter, we paid $499 million in dividend, and repurchased $475 million of our stock for a total return of $974 million. Total cash return to owners in 2016 was $3.78 billion. This combined return demonstrates our confidence in our business model, and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.65 billion in dividend or 40% of trailing 12 months free cash flow. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1.5% over the past 12 months, and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year-on-year for 51 consecutive quarters.
In the fourth quarter, we passed an important milestone, reducing our outstanding share count to fewer than 1 billion shares, or more specifically, 996 million shares. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.49 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This on-shore cash is readily available for multiple uses.
I will now turn it back to Kevin to close out our prepared remarks.
Kevin March
Thanks, Rafael. Our orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenues to be in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion in the first quarter. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.88, which includes a $0.04 tax benefit related to the adoption of the new GAAP standards that I mentioned earlier.
Acquisition charges, which are a non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and holds about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. It will then declines about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2017 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year.
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2016 was moderate again this year. However, our advantages in manufacturing of technology, portfolio grade to market reach and diverse and long-lived product positions, enabled important milestones in the year. These include solid revenue growth in our core businesses of Analog and Embedded, expansion of 300 millimeter Analog production, gross margin improvement of 340 basis points, operating margin improvement of 300 basis points, free cash flow margin improvement of 90 basis points, and continued free cash flow per share growth. We will continue to feed advantageous through disciplined capital allocation by focusing on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve and deliver free cash flow per share growth for our very long-time to come.
Before, I turn it back to Dave and start the Q&A I want to say it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. I thank you for the time you've invested in understanding TI’s performance and strategy, and I wish you all the best. While you will continue to have the benefit of working with our industry's finest Investor Relations Director, I'm confident when I say that you will also come to appreciate Rafael's integrity and intelligence as our new CFO, and you will come to truly enjoy working with him as well just as I have for all these year.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl
Thank you, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Kevin.
"
2017-01-24,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur
Your automotive business grew 23% in 2016, obviously very solid results. Can you guys just help us understand, of the five sub-segments within the auto, what areas drove the more strength?
Kevin March
And as you noted, automotive did grow over 20%. The great news is that wasn’t due to one segment. And I can see that that growth was very diverse, it was diverse across the five sectors that we saw. It was diverse across customers, and is also was very diverse across different product lines. So, we really are excited about the opportunity of both automotive and industrial, and we’re just very pleased that the investments that we made are really kind of providing a base from which we can grow upon. Do you have follow on?
Harlan Sur
Yes, I do. Thank you for that. If I look at the recent SIA industry data, total analog is likely to be up above 5% this year, above $47 billion -- in 2016, your analog business was up about 2% last year, but obviously the growth was impacted by a largest customer that have an inventory correction last year. If you shift this out, does the team think that they gained analog market share, and if so in which of the sub-segments? Thank you.
Kevin March
I think that when we look at our peers with the publicly reported data, we actually believe that we’ve performed quite well. So, we’re probably earlier in the reporting season, so we’ve got a few more to of our peers to put their numbers up. But we’re very confident that we performed very well. So, thank you for that question. And we’ll go to next caller please.
Operator
We’ll go next to Chris Danely with Citi. Go ahead please.
Chris Danely
Hey, thanks guys. And Kevin congratulations on the next Phase, thanks for being patient -- I think the real reason you’re leaving is you’ve got tired of winning for TI to hit my $12 stock price, so -- that’s a joke for all of you who are listening. If you could just list, I guess, the margin drivers and maybe rank them from here as far as how much room or how much leverage you have in terms of mix versus 300 millimeter versus utilization rates versus depreciation?
Kevin March
I hope not to revisit that $12 stock price you’re talking about. Margin drivers, going forward, I think that there will be several things happening. I think we’ve enjoyed the last couple of years. Depreciation coming down same time that 300 millimeter starts to be going up. And those sort of have been tailwinds for us in the last couple of years. As we go forward, depreciation is probably going to begin to flat out there on a quarter-over-quarter basis. They’ll still be down next year versus 2016, but nearly as much that we’ve seen.
What's the lot more important is the continued expansion of 300 millimeter production, as well as the continued improvement of the mix of products that we are shipping. You heard us again talk for a number years about focusing our investments in auto and industrial. And frankly, the margin opportunities in those spaces are very attractive. And still between the mix of products, but importantly, the increasing starts of products on 300 millimeter capacity, there is still room for us to continue to see overall margin growth.
And that’s before we even talked about revenue growth, where this revenue growth just gives us leverage on that capacity that we’ve been investing for these past couple of years. And with depreciation being as low as I was talking about, what that really means is under-utilization charges of negligible. And so really, it's just about fall-through from revenue straight to the bottom line, and that will especially happen to cash flow.
Chris Danely
And so my follow-up longer term question on OpEx. So, if we look at year-over-year, your SG&A trended down a little bit. R&D was up. You guys have said you were going to -- little more money into R&D, assuming revenue continues to grow. What can we expect from R&D and SG&A on a yearly basis? Do you feel comfortable with the level of R&D as it is right here, and could we expect SG&A to continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue, assuming overall revenue growth?
Kevin March
Yes, Chris. That’s a really good question. The last couple of years OpEx has on annual base run about 23% of revenue, and as you noted we have been internally reallocated resources pretty more percent to the R&D areas. That will continue for next couple of quarters and begin to stabilize, and I would expect in 2017 all things being equal will still up at around 23% of OpEx of revenue. Keep in mind that -- we expect our OpEx to probably fluctuate between 20% and 30% on very weak markets and that'd be as high as 30%. And in very strong markets, I might be wrong as low as 20% kind of stable markets we're in right now. I think the OpEx percent you've seen in the last two years is what you expect to get forward for the next year or two.
David Pahl
Right, thanks Chris. And we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.
Joe Moore
I wonder, if you talk about the change to the analog sub-segments as in particular Silicon Valley Analog is a category going only. Does that signify any from a business standpoint in terms of the integration of the old national business? Should we think if there being any structural change to goes along with that?
Kevin March
It has nothing to do with analog business, that’s simply a question of realigning our products to the way that we have come to understand and our customer preferred to look for them when they trying to find products here at TI. And so, if you look at the categories that we've lined up with up as Power, we have Signal Chain and we have High Volume Analog & Logic. And that’s really how we have learned our customers preferred to sort of fine products at TI. And so that’s allows us to give them better and faster support.
The Silicon Valley Analog products along with High Performance Analog that's been reallocated among those segment of those new products lines that we've just talked about. So consequently, the best way to think about this is how do we react faster and more thoroughly to increase and searches for products in our portfolio. For the balance portfolio like ours, it's really important for us to be sure that we are aligned as efficiently as possible for customer to get to the parts they need more.
Joe Moore
Okay, great that’s helpful. That’s helpful thank you. And then just returning to the growth in autos, I guess we see the peer group is growing sort of high single digits maybe little bit better, so obviously you are growing quite a bit faster in autos than other analog companies. Should we think of that is being sort of sustainable gains? Or just how do you -- is anything you kind of help us understand why that was such a good number? And what should we expect going forward?
Kevin March
Joe, this isn't -- as you know and you have been tracking our revenues inside of that market for some time. It's not something that is capping this quarter, right. We have been having very strong growth inside of automotive and that is a result of how we allocate capital. We have for some time been directing investments and increases both in automotive and industrial. And that’s because we think that those are the two markets that are going to provide growth, not just for us but in our industry. So -- and as you know, these are long tail type of design wins and revenue strength. And we are very intentional as I mentioned earlier trying to direct our investments, so we are not just seeing growth in one sector or at one customer. So, that’s what we are trying to do. So thanks for that question. We will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Romit Shah with Nomura. Go ahead please.
Romit Shah
Yes, Kevin, congratulations on your retirement, all the best. I wanted ask Dave, did you gave us channel inventory, how much supply your distributors are carrying in the quarter?
David Pahl
I haven’t but I would certainly can, inventory was even with the Eureco [ph] and decreased by about a half of week sequentially. And it's still running at around four weeks in the channel. And I just also have a reminder that that number benefits because of our consignment programs that we have in place with our distributors.
Romit Shah
You guys talked about moderate growth again last year, but there has been I guess talk more recently about stimulus better GDP growth under the new administration. And I'm curious, how do you think your distributors would react under that scenario? Do you think it's -- do you guys think about it as your distributors restocking as a major driver for this year?
Kevin March
Romit, I don’t think that we're quite that precise on that kind of thinking as how distributors might react. We look at the talk of stimulus with some anticipation of the positive boost to the economy, but frankly we think it's probably too early to figure out what that might be and how might manifest it itself. A lot of that stimulus seems to be focused towards infrastructure, and so if in fact just wind up there that with the further benefit on our industrial portfolio. More important to us as to watch what's happening on the tax front, and hopefully we will finally get some tax relief out of Washington, which will be a significant benefit to our shareholders.
Rafael Lizardi
Yes, Romit, I'll just add that if you look as I said inventory was even with where we ended last year, it was actually down sequentially. So reflected in our numbers really has no restocking inside of it. And I would just say that the inventory levels that they have, the inventory levels that we have, just reflect an environment where we've got good product availability. And because of our investments in capacity ahead of demand, if these things do show up and turn into more significant growth going forward, we're ready to be able to support that. So, thank you Romit and will go to the next caller please.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.
Ross Seymore
Thanks for letting me ask the question. And first Kevin congrats and to Rafael too congrats on the promotion. Looking at the Analog business in the fourth quarter Dave, it was up 10% year-over-year, but you said HVAL was flat. I was little surprised that that side being flat and the remainder must have been up a good 13% to 15% year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about what the drivers were that created such a delta between those segments?
David Pahl
Yes, so I think if you look at year-over-year by end market, personal electronics was down slightly due to mobile phones. So, if you back out mobile phones the actually personal electronics was up slightly, so that was the main reason that we saw that. You could kind of see that inside of our Analog. And that weakness in mobile phones was not just inside of HVAL, but you've saw that to a lesser extent inside the Power.
Ross Seymore
On the OpEx side of your equation, I know, Kevin, you answered some questions about the R&D remaining elevated. If we think in the first quarter traditionally that goes up for just beginning of the year reasons by about 5%. Is that about the right area we should think OpEx changing sequentially in 1Q or is it different issue due to that reallocation.
Kevin March
No, I wouldn’t expect anything particularly different. The reallocation is mostly coming out of SG&A as we go forward, so it's just the mix coming out of that. So, total OpEx will continue to increase as you know seasonally in first quarter because of the absence holidays in the fourth quarter as well as the annual pay and benefit increases that we fully across our company in first quarter.
Operator
We'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Go ahead please.
Stacy Rasgon
Around the gross margin drives particularly 300 millimeters, you seem to be talking about that is probably the biggest driver on a go forward basis structurally. Can you talk to about us in terms of where you are on 300 millimeter utilization versus a year ago particularly given the amount of extension that you are doing? How much I guess room do you still have to grow there? And how does that compare to where you were a year ago?
Kevin March
Yes, Stacy, I think that we have talked about between Richardson factory, which we call RFAB and the PMOS6 in Dallas location. If combined, we have about $8 billion of revenue generating capacity in those factories combined. We have continued to increase starts meaningfully on 300 millimeter for analog. And that is really going to be picking up pace more and more the new products that we are released and are being released on 300 millimeter. And the economics as you all aware are very compelling, I mean the bottom line is the chip costs are about 40% less from 300 millimeters versus 200 millimeters.
So, the total finished products about 20% less, which add meaningfully, not only to gross margins but especially free cash flow. So that’s a small space, we want to repeat it. So, again our starts continue to increase, and we continue to have a lot of capacity available to us. But more importantly, we have a lot of new devices and the pipeline being released onto 300 millimeter, and that all coming together will probably continue to accelerate the rate of starts and therefore we also will get from that manufacturing market.
David Pahl
I'll just add Stacy as a seamless plug for our capital management call. Rafael and I'll cover more that detail in our capital management call.
Stacy Rasgon
For my follow-up, I want to touch a bit on the accounting changes, and it seems to be influencing both the earnings as well as the share count. The diluted share count went up this quarter for the first time, and for everybody it sounds like, it was boosted by 500 million shares or so like because of the accounting change. So how should we think about that I guess going to 2017? Is it still something like a $0.03 or $0.04 per quarter benefits that's going to sort of sustain kind of into perpetuity? And in terms of share count, was it sort of like a one-time step-up? And should we still think about shares declining going forward even given I guess the increased dividends to reduced buybacks?
Kevin March
So, Stacy, just a little more background on this gap change, it's going to impact all companies beginning $11 implemented being in the first quarter 2017 reported. So, we are basically only adopted by one quarter. The idea is trying to help with the better comparability for 2016 or '17. That being said, it does cause reported earnings to increase because of this tax benefit. It also met medical requires you compete with your share count differently and so added about 5 million shares to the share count just complaint to new calculation rules.
In 2016, had we applied to the same gap at the beginning of the year, it would have added $0.04 to the first quarter, $0.03 for the second quarter, $0.04 for the third quarter and added a penny to the fourth quarter for total of $0.13 for the year. The way that we would recommend that you model for purposes of analyzing a company going forward is somewhat we are doing and that is just look at what happened last year and used that same sort of assumption for next year.
I am pretty sure that will wind up be in different when we close the books on those assumptions, but that’s the best way to model. So consequently, we had $0.04 that would have occurred in the first quarter 2016, and the guidance that we just offered for the first quarter 2017 is included $0.04, and we would suggest as it same thing.
David Pahl
Stacy, let me just add to that that are -- for looking at next year our commitment, our capital management strategy and the discipline execution of that strategy remains unchanged. Our target is to return all of our free cash to the owners of the Company. And with the dividend model that we announced last quarter, it provides a more reverse framework to adjust allocation between -- of that return between dividend growth and share repurchases.

We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to wish congratulations and good luck to Kevin and welcome to Rafael. So my first question, I know it's early days, but can you share any views on impact from any potential borrowed tax rate change or conversely any lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate? What would TI do differently, if either of these two things were to happen?
Kevin March
Vivek, this is very speculative at this stage because clearly you can see just from reported press, so there is difference with opinions as to what kind of tax policies to employ between the President and the Congress. So, I think it's little bit hard for us to be able to characterize what that might do. What I can say is that any form of relief will be beneficial directed to our shareholders because that will simply expand our free cash flow.
And as Rafael just commented, our commitment remains as it has been, best to return on 100% of free cash flow to our shareholder through dividend and stock not buybacks. So, any form whether it's borrower tax adjustments or actual lowering of the overall tax brackets clearly will be beneficial to our shareholders, and I am looking forward to seeing that happen.
David Pahl
You have follow on to that?
Vivek Arya
Yes, thanks Dave. Last quarter, you mentioned that it's seems like it's been in at 3% to 4% growth, but then you grew 7% in Q4 and you are guiding to 10% plus in Q1. I understand part of it is probably just normalization at one of your larger customers. But what is driving the upside, is it sustainable? Are we now in a 7% plus growth or like what's the change this year to deter us from that kind of growth trajectory?
Kevin March
Yes. So, first Vivek, I’ll just point out that when we look at the overall microenvironment, we really don’t see something that has significantly changed in sometime. So, we continue to believe that we're operating in a very similar microenvironment that we have, that we haven't been If you look at inside of the quarter, demand came in stronger, really across most markets in businesses. The only notable exception as I talked about before was personal electronic came in about as we expected.
And to your point, we are seeing choppiness in particular markets. Some of that more recently has been driven by one large customer. You can go back to clock not too long ago into last year we saw some choppiness in comps equipment before that we had a PC, XP refresh cycle that came to an end. And none of those were really tighter the overall economy, there was just very specific things going on within specific market. So, that's really the environment that we thing that we're operating in now. So, thank you and we'll go to next caller please.
Operator
Next is John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please.
John Pitzer
Thanks for letting me ask the question and I'll chime in with my congratulations to Kevin. Kevin, I guess my first question is just looking at the up margins on the embedded business. You did a great job throughout calendar year 2016, as you grew that business to drive leverage and upside to the operating margins, but there is still a pretty healthy gap between the up margins and embedded and those in Analog. Is that still just the matter of getting more scale in the embedded business? Or how do we think about those up margins closing overtime.
Kevin March
John, I think that's quite I think about it is, but we have been talking about for number of years, which means you set up investments in that area in number of years back. And then we readjust the investments especially for the base stations marketplaces, and since then we think we've got the investment that was about right. So, it really is a question of continuing to get leverage from revenue grown.
Falling always through to up margins you pointed up, but again what we focused on that falls through on a free cash flow, and that's a real focus. So, there is nothing inherent that keeps it from continuing to improve in fact I would not be surprise to see as the team there continue to improve on that as they to put me understand where leverage capability they have on the investment base they have right now.
John Pitzer
Yes, this is my follow-on. I apologize for asking, but a lot of my questions were already asked and answered. But just on the other revenue line, maybe if you look at your revenue holistically overtime, it's become significantly less volatile but that other bucket has jumped around a lot on quarter-on-quarter. And Dave, let me be just give us some guidance from these levels how we should think about kind of seasonality or the cadence of the other rep going forward?
David Pahl
Yes, I think if you look for -- look at it for the full year, it decreased 3% year-on-year. And as we talked about before when you look at the history, it had decline more or like in the mid-teens and that was primarily as the legacy wireless products had on loaned. And we expect kind of going forward that we would be somewhere in a mid-single digit decline. There is seasonality inside of the other business it's driven primarily by calculators, they have a very strong seasonality due to back to school and then we also have royalties inside there that can choppy every once in a while. So those are the types of things, but overall when you look at much like this year we saw a 3% decline just probably similar to what we would expect to see going forward.
Operator
The next is the Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead please.
Ambrish Srivastava
Kevin, congratulations on your next phase of life and you've been nothing but an absolute pleasure in all the dealings we have had to do, so thank you for that. My first question Dave is on the industrial business, auto is a great business for you, over the years you have been consistently outgrowing the industry, but automotive is a $4 billion business. And I think a year ago, I had given you not really a lot of hard time, but I had asked you why the business didn’t grow last year? So that was in 2015, but you are growing this business again at a pretty decent rate almost 10%, so what are some of the areas that are driving that growth?
David Pahl
Ambrish, actually, if you look at the actual numbers I know you are using the rounded numbers that we've gave you. It's more like the mid-single digit, so a growth for the Europe, for industrial '16 over '15, and it good to see, good solid growth there. When we look the down into the details of the 14 sectors, we actually did see growth in most of those sectors 14 year. So again it's kind of same comments and hit on the automotive we are just encouraged that our investments are really turning to that broad based growth. Do you have a follow-on Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
I did. On the consumer side in specifically in mobile would March quarters and be up year-over-year? And would consumer be up year-over-year? All I am trying to understand is if the indigestion you had a year ago is that was supposed to bear that it will last into March or its behind us.
David Pahl
Yes, so we are careful try to give guidance on below the top line in any sector, but I think your instincts that will have easy compare because of the weakness we saw a year ago will probably be correct. We have got time for one last call please.
Operator
Last question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.
Toshiya Hari
My first question is again on industrial and Dave I appreciate your comments about they're being broad based growth in the segment. But if I recall correctly, I think this is the second conservative quarter where you guys point to an improvement in the industrial market place. So just curious if there are any kind of specific regions or end market areas well that’s kind of driving that infection and in the market and industrial?
David Pahl
Yes, there is a -- we are seeing that really broad based growth across regions, across products and across those 14 sectors that we have got in it. So, we're real pleased with that growth. Do you have a follow-on Toshiya?
Toshiya Hari
Yes, thanks Dave. This is a technical one. So the IP, the one-time benefit you guys saw in Q4 from your IP agreements. Is this one-time in nature? Or could we see this materialized again in future quarters? And also what the nature of the contractor or the agreement was for this?
David Pahl
Yes, it included several agreements with the several different cross licensees, but the part of that was a sale of some IP assets, and that was recognized and restructuring other lines. And then the balance was settlement of past infringement that was recognized in the other income expense model. On an ongoing basis, it tends to be multi across license agreements. So, we would expect about $20 million of annual benefit for the foreseeable future as a result of agreement to these new intellectual property contracts. It's a roughly $20 million a year annual benefit going forward.
David Pahl
And thank you all for joining us. Again please plan to join us for our capital management call on February 8th at 10 AM Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments’ Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl
Thank you and good afternoon. And thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI’s Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I’ll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were slightly above our expected range. Compared with a year ago, demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and strengthened in the industrial market. Demand in the personal electronics market was about even from a year ago.
In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% and Analog revenue grew 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.94. With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 8% from a year ago.
Free cash flow margin was 29.5% of revenue, up from 27.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Also today, we announced a 32% dividend increase that Kevin will provide more detail on in a moment.
From a year ago, Analog revenue grew 6% due to High Performance Analog, Silicon Valley Analog and Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic was about even. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines, led by Processors.
In our Other segment, revenue grew 7% from a year ago primarily due to calculators and DLP products, and was partially offset by a decrease in royalties and custom ASIC products.
Now I’ll provide some insight into this quarter’s revenue performance by end markets versus a year-ago. Automotive demand remained strong, with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand improved and had broad-based growth, with most sectors growing. Personal electronics was about even despite continued year-over-year decline in demand from one customer. This decline was offset by growth elsewhere. Communications equipment grew from a year ago and was even sequentially. And lastly, enterprise systems grew.
We continue to focus on making our Company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter of $2.28 billion was 62.0% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 380 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs. Operating expenses were $804 million, or 21.9% of revenue.
Over the last 12 months, we’ve invested $1.33 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Operating profit was $1.40 billion, or 38.0% of revenue. Operating profit was up 20% percent from the year-ago quarter.
Operating margin for Analog was 40.9% and for Embedded Processing was 27.7%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the third quarter was $968 million, or $0.94 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million, or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300 millimeter Analog capacity, to be about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion, or 29.5% of revenue. Free cash flow was 8% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we’ve said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders.
Our intent, over time, remains to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement. Consistent with this intent, we’ve announced a 32% or $0.12 increase in our quarterly dividend. This brings our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 annualized.
I also will note we have updated our long-term dividend model from our prior target of about 50% of trailing four-year average free cash flow to a range of 50% to 80%. This new range provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases. Today’s announcement extends our string of dividend increases to 13 consecutive years, which we believe are an important element of shareholder returns.
In the third quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $500 million of our stock for a total return of $882 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 2% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This on-shore cash is readily available for a variety of uses. Our orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 6% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.17 billion to $3.43 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year. So in summary, we believe our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator.
"
2016-10-26,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about OpEx is roughly flat quarter-over-quarter R&D up and you talked about increasing R& D investment. Given that what are your expectations for R&D in total OpEx as we go into Q4 I know seasonally they would be down, but given the increases that we’re seeing in R&D how should we think it OpEx next quarter.
Kevin March
So Stacy I think as we’ve talked about R&D what we continue to reallocate and we will continue to reallocate through the first half of next year resources from other areas of the company into R&D. But overall, you should think about OpEx in 4Q pretty much being the same as you’ve seen in each of the last several years that is down, because we have seasonal benefit there just from the fact that there’s going to be Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays going on. So total OpEx, the shift continued to be seasonally down.
David Pahl
Do you have a follow-up?
Stacy Rasgon
Yes, thank you. From a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the change in strategy between or apparent change in strategy between dividends and buybacks. Does that imply and I mean what does that imply in terms of how you see the current return on your own stock versus the potential for at least how you view the stability and strength of your business going forward, seems like you’re allocating more into dividends now?
Kevin March
Well. And that is correct. We are planning to allocate more towards the dividends at this point in time. We’ve always said the buybacks will vary as a function of the stock price and a dividend model that can vary from 50% to 80%, we believe there is more thorough comprehensive or capital allocation. This new model provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder returns between dividend growth and share repurchases and that’s really what we’re talking about here.
David Pahl
Okay, great. Thank you, Stacy. Next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on the analog margin side. I believe record levels for you 40 plus here. I think the highest I’ve seen out there is high 40s at linear. Curious do you think that you could achieve that over time and as part of that thought process what percentage of your mix would have to be on 300 millimeter to get to that kind of level.
Kevin March
C.J. the possibility for improving margins in analog are not anything that we would hold back your expectation on, because you’ve actually hit the essence of the formula there and that is we have more and more revenue being generated on 300 millimeter where we enjoy a significant cost benefit versus any of our competitors. We’ll see that just falling straight through not just the margin, but all the way through the free cash flow which is most important in our mind. So clearly, as you pointed out, this has been a new height for our analog segment and that business still has plenty of runway underneath as we go forward.
David Pahl
And than I just add C.J. that when you look at our practice of buying capacity well ahead of demand, that puts us in a places. At the end of last year, we had about $6 billion of open 300 millimeter capacity. So as revenue grows that was 200 millimeter capacity that will help to grow free cash flow margin as well as operating margins in the businesses that you’ve been. So the fact that it’s 300 millimeter, of course and the fact that it’s 40% lower cost will certainly help us as well. Do you have follow-up C.J.?
C.J. Muse
I do. A shorter term question, as you look to your implied guide of down 10% and I know typical seasonality is kind of throwing out the door here, but I guess in the last five years your average is roughly down 7%. So is there any one-time issues here, customer concentration, conservatism how should we think about that?
David Pahl
Yes. I think if you look at the midpoint of the guidance C.J., it would suggest a year-on-year growth of about 3%. So I think in general, we just believe that’s just very consistent with the modest overall macro environment. And that’s really kind of been the case for the last few years. So our view really remains that we’re in the slow growth economic environment. We don’t really see any catalyst that’s really going to change that one direction or the other any time soon. So thank you. We’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next caller is Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
Hi, thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the demand environment. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on the different buckets within TI industrial personal electronics, comms equipment in automotive and specifically what sort of trends you saw in the quarter and more importantly what your internal expectations are heading into Q4.
David Pahl
Okay. So let me just talk about what drove the quarter. As I mentioned before, the automotive market remained strong. We’ve got five sectors inside of that market and most of them had grown double-digit. Industrial demand improved and encouraging part of that was it was very, very broad-based and we had most of the sectors growing.
Inside the personal electronics that was even and that was despite continued year-over-year declines in demand from one customer, but I think that speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base, we were able to offset that with growth elsewhere inside of personal electronics.
And then communications equipment grew from a year ago was even sequentially. And lastly, we did see growth in enterprise systems as well. So when we look into the fourth quarter, we’ll call out anything that is moving around significantly, you’ve seen us do that in the past when we’ve had some type of discontinuity to help explain the results and that’s not the case as we move into fourth quarter. So do you have a follow-up Tosh?
Toshiya Hari
Yes, I do. Thanks for that. So my second question is on M&A, clearly TI has been very disciplined especially with regards to valuation over the past couple of years maybe even several years. Obviously, you’ve seen a lot of activity elsewhere in the industry, I was just hoping you could provide an update on as to how you approach M&A detail? Thank you.
Kevin March
Tosh our first M&A is really no different than we’ve talked about in the past. There are really four attributes that we think that we have put us in a pretty unique position versus our competitors and actually quite difficult for others to duplicate. Those include our approach to manufacturing technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, our reach to our market channels and the diversity and all that positions that our products enjoy in the marketplace.
So when we look at the acquisitions, it’s both trying to see if we can strengthen those four attributes and really if not so by looking at companies and standpoint of the strategic match. That means, we’ll have strategic match delivered to the strength of the competitive advantage we’ve been building on these last number of years.
So from a strategic standpoint that would probably include a company that’s likely engaged in Analog and probably has pretty good exposure to Industrial and Automotive which is where we believe most of the growth for some if that is going to happen for a quite a few years to come.
If a potential target passes the strategy test and we’ve got to get past the numbers test. And that really means the price that we pay for it. For the return on that price for the return on that investment capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital in about a four-year timeframe. If we can get all that to work then we will remain disciplined and just stay on the sidelines.
As we look at what’s been going on in the M&A landscape these last couple of years and strike us that there are probably really two things underway for most participants in that space they’re either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunities because they have fairly narrow markets.
In our case, we already enjoy advantages in both of those, so we don’t feel compelled to have to move unless we can pass that strategy and match test I just talked about a moment ago.
David Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Toshiya. And we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We have Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher Danely
Thanks guys. I guess one more question on the Q4 revenue guidance. I am just looking at the results of the last 10 or so years and it’s only been down double-digits I think once in eight years or something like that. I remember last year you guys got it down 7% sequentially. Has anything changed recently? Have you seen any change in order rates, any change in the end markets, change in linearity, change in anything I’m just wondering why the downtime?
David Pahl
Yes, again Chris, no big changes on that. I think it’s just consistency with the overall macro and if you look over the last five years, we’ve had a range from as high as down 1.3% and back in 2012 I think we’re down 12.1%. So certainly our range that we’ve given is certainly inside of those things from a sequential standpoint. So that’s kind of how we are looking at them. Do you have a follow-on?
Christopher Danely
Yes. Can you just talk about utilization rates? How much sort of below capacity you guys are? And where we should expect utilization rates to trend in Q4 and how you feel about inventory as a result of that?
Kevin March
So Chris on utilization, it really hasn’t changed much from probably last three or four quarters and I don’t expect it to change anytime in the near-term. We load the factories on accordance with our expectation of demand and because of our inventory strategy sometimes that demands goes beyond just next quarter may include the following quarter.
From an inventory standpoint to recall that our model is to have 105 to 135 days. We had quite a bit more inventory last quarter and we from a day standpoint and we had – David mentioned that we have built that anticipation of growing revenues in the third quarter. We have had those growing revenues and our inventory days dropdown to 117. So I expect that will continue to operate within the model days that we talk about and our utilizations will continue to be relatively stable as we’ve seen in the last three four quarters.
David Pahl
Great, thank you Chris. Next caller please.
Operator
Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore
Great, thank you. I have one short-term question and one long-term question. In the shorter-term you said Personal Electronics kind of flat year-over-year despite declines that one customer can give us a sense for which areas are growing year-over-year as other smartphones, PCs, where that growth components of that business right now?
David Pahl
Yes, at that level we’ve had PCs come in year-over-year about even which is an improvement from what we saw. I think that outside of that one customer we’ve actually seen really broad based growth. And so I think that all the classical areas inside a Personal Electronics are doing well. So you have a follow-on?
Joseph Moore
Sure, thank you. And then longer-term side as you look at your automotive business. Obviously that’s a focus for you guys. Can you talk a little bit about how do you plan for that business and how much of your effort is sort of aimed at sort of traditional building block catalog type products, and when you think about markets like autonomous driving where there might be sort of systems level solutions how much are you thinking about the sort of need to do something, that’s a little bit more revolutionary rather than evolutionary in that part market?
David Pahl
Sure yes, so we have - we’ve got five sectors that make up the automotive market for us that we look at their infotainment, safety, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or ADAS, Body Electronics and Lighting and then power train systems, which include hybrid and electric systems.
And we have a very intentional focus to invest across all of those five sectors. We’re seeing that in the results with revenues and most of those sectors growing double digits and we have an approach inside of Automotive that is similar really across their other markets where we look to leverage our four competitive advantages and I think that that’s helping to turn in those results.
So we are favoring what I would say a catalog and application specific solutions. I wouldn’t put that into the category of full turnkey system level solutions where we’re doing what we would consider to be the work that our customers do. So we are providing them. Building blocks that have different levels of integration but we’re not looking to provide a full ADAS system as an example. So will enable those systems and I think that that’s pretty consistent with what you see across all the markets and sectors that that we serve, so. Okay. Thanks Joe and we’ll go to next caller please.
Operator
And we have Chris Caso with CLSA.
Christopher Caso
Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess first question would be regarding your comments on the industrial segment you talked about some broad improvement. I guess could you talk about your level of visibility there and the likelihood of that sustaining into the end of the year and moving into next year?
David Pahl
Can you just ask that once again make sure I got the question right, Chris.
Christopher Caso
Sorry, it was regarding the Industrial segment and your comments on that you talked about broad improvement. If you can give some more color on that and your view on the potential for that to sustain into year end and into next year?
David Pahl
Yes. I think as we talked about last quarter we did see an improvement in industrial demand it actually had been flat for several quarters year-on-year, so we were encouraged by that. This quarter we’ve built on that a little bit and like last quarter it was very, very broad-based. I won’t try to go in and try to predict how long that will last or carryforward, but I definitely would say that we were encouraged as we saw most of those sectors growing. Yes, follow-on Chris.
Christopher Caso
I do kind follow-on is regarding inventory in both the channel at your customers and given the stronger growth in Q3 was any part of that growth perhaps contributed to some increase in inventory, understand that most of your inventory in the distribution channel on consignment now, but what’s your view of customer inventory levels right now?
David Pahl
Yes. So if we look into the distribution channel inventory is actually decreased by about a half a week and it’s currently very, very low levels at about four weeks and that’s pretty similar to what we saw a year-ago. So again, we just we believe that that inventory level just reflects an environment of really good product availability and we’ve got you know good inventories on our books available to be able to ship.
We continue to have very stable lead times and those things kind of taken together just drive very high customer service metrics. So customers in general are getting products when they want to have them. So and I’ll just make the reminder too that four weeks of inventory is just structurally lower because of the consignment programs that we have at our major distributors. So thank you Chris and we’ll go to the next caller please.

We have Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi, thank you. My first question is on the embedded side. This segment has been growing really well for the last third quarter in the year posting pretty good year-over-year growth. What’s driving that Dave, I know it has three major segments? Could you just help us understand the drivers behind the growth?
David Pahl
Yes I think when you look at the embedded market. We’ve seen good growth there for a number of quarters and if you look at the end markets they have a very good exposure to automotives, to industrial, and to that the comps markets. So as we talked about the communications market or really all three of those markets contributed to the growth.
And the great thing about the growth is it’s very broad-based its not in. One market it’s not in, one sector it’s not driven by one technology. So we feel really good about the sustainability of that growth and the great thing with that is it’s fallen through to the operating profit, which you can see inside of that business. And most importantly is following through to free cash flow growth. So you have a follow on Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava
Yes, I did. Could you talk a little bit your – that this seems to be a change in the relationship with how you work with your major distribution partners and our sense is this is nothing new, but could you just help us understand how you thought through the pros and cons of this change and whether it’s just a matter of you having more in consignment or it’s trade-off between confidence of sourcing your own wins versus potential loss in future sales? Thank you.
David Pahl
Yes. So our relationship with distributors have been evolving and always evolving like any healthy business relationships of all, but especially as the reach of our channel advantages continues to strengthen. So you know you’ve heard Kevin and I both mention our four competitive advantages and certainly the reach of our channel is one of them.
And so that includes both the size and the skill of our direct sales and applications teams, but it also includes the growing capabilities of the web and TI.com. So as an example three years ago we discontinued our incentive programs for demand creation on accounts that represented about 80% of the TAM where we had resources calling on those accounts directly.
We made that that change because our team is just more effective and efficient at and demand creation and this is played out as we’ve continued to gain share every year since then. And more recently, we’ve discontinue the incentives for remain balance of the accounts. So we expect as with all relationships that will continue to evolve but we do believe distributors will continue to play an important role in order fulfillment for our customers. Okay, thank you Ambrish. And we will go to the next caller please.

We have David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong
Thanks very much. TI and several other chip companies had really impressive September year-over-year growth. That was many percent about guidance and you’re also giving December guidance which is solid even then the year-over-year growth in December looks like it’s going to be below September. Can you give us some feel as to what’s happening here that things weaken and September progressed or is December particularly tough comparison?
David Pahl
Yes. David if you look at our normal seasonality the one thing that we can conclude for sure is that the second and third quarter are seasonally strongest quarters fourth and first are seasonally weakest and so certainly that that will play in effect as we go into fourth quarter. So it’s not unusual for us to see fourth quarter that’s down and in fact why we point to the year-over-year guidance and how that is consistent with just our belief is that things in the macro really haven’t changed too dramatically. So that has gone into the guidance. Do you have a follow-on.
David Wong
No. I am good. Thank you.
David Pahl
Okay. Thank you David. 
Operator
The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and dividend boost. Maybe I’ll also try my hand on this Q4 outlook question. Because I still don’t know whether this is a top down forecast or it’s a bottoms up forecast because with specific end market is going down sequentially so much for your overall sales to go down 10%.
And I don’t know whether it’s actually the other segment which had very strong growth in Q3 and I know Dave you mentioned on an year-on-year basis but last year I believe your sales were down in Q4. So the comps should have been easier versus the last year, so that’s really my first question that is this top down forecast or is this a bottoms up forecast.
Kevin March
I think Dave has probably answered that same question about three or four times now and the answer still going to be the same. It is our best outlook right now based up on a continuing weak macro economy. We had a book-to-bill in 3Q of 0.99 compared that to 1.0 a year ago. So the visibility into the quarter is a little bit reduce versus it was a year ago.
There is no one market, no one customer, no one product, it is our best estimate at this point in time. And I’ll remind you it does include a range and that range probably comprehends to high probability where will land fourth quarters.
David Pahl
And I just add the fact that whenever we’ve had a big discontinuity that you’re searching around for, we’ve been clear at following those things out. So we want to be able to provide that transparency when it’s necessary. So do you have a follow-on.
Vivek Arya
Yes. Thank you. Now given the focus on free cash flow, why isn’t TI better utilizing an asset like your balance sheet because you’re operating, if my numbers are right at about 0.15 net debt to trailing EBITDA and most of your peers are comfortable operating at three to four times. So given this low growth environment and sort of negative returns for holding cash, why is TI holding so much cash and why not buyback more of your stock if you think M&A looks expensive or not attractive right now. Thank you.
Kevin March
I think its now you consider our stock quite undervalued at the moment in times. I appreciate that observation. We have been buying back shares every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2004 our method for buying back shares is to be disciplined and consistent in how we go about doing it.
More importantly what we’ve talked about is that we will buyback more shares when the price is lower and probably fewer shares when the price is higher. And so to that end we recently as with today’s announcement have updated our allocation budget if you will for what we allocate in free cash flow to dividends from 50% of our trailing four years average free cash flow to 50% to 80%. We think this new range provides a more robust framework that allows us to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchases.
To as far as leveraging the balance sheet any further right now that balance sheet has been leveraged higher in the past, we have been slowly paying that debt back down over time which means the debt is available today and important strategic opportunities present some at the right moment in time. We believe that leveraging now just for the sake of leveraging would actually block the balance sheet and being available should an opportunity present ourselves out there from a strategic standpoint.
David Pahl
Okay, great. Thank you, Vivek. And we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
The next caller is Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks a lot. I’ve a question and a follow-up as well. I guess just starting on the dividend increase that you guys announced. Could you just talk about as I think about the future dividend payout strategies you guys have? Is it going to be more reflection of your free cash flow growth on an annualized basis or with the desire be to increase dividends along with free cash flow growth plus increasing the payout as you get to the midpoint of this 50% to 80% range. So how do I think about this on an annual basis?
Kevin March
Well, I think if you think about that what you have been seeing is probably what you will see and that is our free cash flow has been growing consistently for quite a few years now. And our formula design means that by definition are dividends are increasing consistent with that. What this new range does is just give us more framework to adjust the allocation between dividends and stock buybacks. We call it that we take all the free cash flow and we use it either for dividend or buyback. And this allows us to allocate more towards dividend growth as opposed to buyback going forward.
If we reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in time then this allows us to slow down the dividend growth rate and adjust that back towards dividend repurchases. So that’s what this new range is designed to do is to give us more flexibility to be responsive to the changing market valuations that we see out there. Do you have follow-on Amit?
Amit Daryanani
Got it. If I can just follow-up, your R&D is sort of increased doubled-digit the few quarters. It sounds like, it will do so again. Does that suggest that you kind of shifting a little bit from harvesting towards investing more in your business? And if that’s the case, should we recalibrate expectations maybe in calendar 2017 and 2018 that the share again that you guys are typically out 30, 40, 50 basis points could be somewhat higher given all the investments you’re making?
Kevin March
Well, certainly we’re investing more in the R&D with the intent of continuing our share gains and ideally accelerating them. And really what we’re doing on the stuff, we are being very disciplined on R&D as well. We’re not spending just for the sake of spending, but we’re spending because we have a higher degree of confidence and the ideas are coming to us that we can actually turn that into profitable revenue growth and ideally market share.
And we’re doing that by just reallocating our internal resources as we mentioned, meaning we’re not taking our total spending up, but we’re taking people who may have been working in the manufacturing lines or people who may have been working in sales or general administrative areas and putting them into working on R&D projects as well. So it’s an overall reallocation internally and I would expect that that will continue to support our market share gains as we go forward.
David Pahl
Yes. I would add that we’ve gained on average 30 to 40 basis points of market share and I think we’ve gained share each of the last six years. I think we’re on track to be able to put a seven figure up and we’ll wait for the numbers to get posted before we declare that. But again, market share just doesn’t move quickly in the markets that we’ve got and I think that just speaks to the quality of the market. So I think these opportunities that Kevin just talking about just gives us confidence that we can continue to have share gains into the future. Thanks, Amit and we will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. 
Ian Ing
Yes, thank you. In your prepared comments, you talked about being opportunistic in terms of purchasing assets ahead of demand, so do you anticipate any greater opportunities or fire sales as the industry I would say rapidly consolidates. I mean, you probably got enough wafer fabrication equipment, but maybe there’s other areas like test and packaging? Thanks.
David Pahl
Yes. Ian, I would say that we are continuously on the lookout for buying assets that we don’t need now, but we believe we will need at some point in time, it could be a strategic cost advantage to us at some point in time and we have been in pretty much every quarter, picking up some piece of equipment here or there.
But again, we look at the total opportunity, meaning, can we get the right price and can it be something that will contribute to our free cash flow as we go forward and so we look at it in that context when we consider these sorts of things. So I would expect that we will continue to be out there, making opportunistic acquisitions. Some may rise to the level of an announced, but most of them are probably just remain as they have been just spot purchases that we do from time to time as we look around the world.
David Pahl
Yes, and I’ll also point out we’re making those purchases while keeping our CapEx at about 4% of revenues, so continuing to strengthen that competitive advantage. Do you have follow-up Ian?
Ian Ing
Yes, over to embedded processing. Questions on expectations for DSP applications, should we think of it is largely communication infrastructure 4G and 5G. I noticed there is DSP, IT companies out there, they are talking about using these chips as accelerators for things like Deep learning, artificial intelligence accelerating some applications.
David Pahl
Yes, I think when you look at our portfolio that the lines between what the DSP and what’s not a DSP blur to some degree so like you said in the comm’s equipment space you’ve got processors that have multicourse of both arms and DSP’s but also have a heavy component of hardware accleators.
Our OMAP products that are gaining traction and automotive and other applications inside of industrial have DSPs inside of them. If you look at our communication products where we support over a dozen different standards that help machines be connected and be smarter, they will have now DSP inside of them.
So we kind of just look at that as an enabling technology, the good news is that that business complements our analog product portfolio, very well it isn’t one type of product or technology that’s building that business. We’ve got a very good diversity of customers that we’re building over time. So we’re encouraged by the confidence in the sustainability of that revenue and the wires underneath and the technology underneath are important on how we deliver it. But the business model is what’s really encouraging for us. So okay, we can go to - have time for one more caller please.
Operator
Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes, guys thanks for squeezing me in here. Kevin I guess my first question is you talked about OpEx being down sequentially in December quarter. Depending upon how much down sequentially it is, you could still have gross margins kind of flat to up in the December quarter and notwithstanding the revenue decline, you’ve had in prior quarters were down revenue doesn’t necessarily mean down gross margins. So kind of curious how you think about gross margins going into the calendar fourth quarter and what leverage you can still pull other than just volume to keep moving gross margins up into the right.
Kevin March
John, I think you know that we normally don’t try to give that precise of forecast other than just topline and bottom line and earnings. But I would just remind you that, just like 3Q benefited from lower costs we increased production in the 300-millimeter and depreciation rolling off. Depreciation will continue to roll off and 300-millimeter will continue to become a bigger portion of wafers that we start. So you’ve got a number of underlying cost things that will continue to give us good results on the overall gross margin for those who are interested in that number.
John Pitzer
That’s helpful. I appreciate it. And then Dave I guess is my follow-up. You talked about your largest customer in Personal Electronics being down year-over-year in the September quarter. Do you think that’s an accurate reflection of kind of their unit demand or is there something going on with your content or your pricing? Would you expect that customer to be down again year-over-year in the December quarter?
David Pahl
Well I will say that I’m not going to make any comments on their command. And with most of our large customers if I’ll just generalize the comment, most of our large customers will be on some type of consignment or hub based systems. So there is usually not a large delay and the demand when it actually gets pulled and when it’s used. There’s always an exception to that overall.
From a content standpoint, I think we’ve mentioned before that we sell hundreds of products into our largest customers including our largest one and we continue to see win new products. So we’re confident in the design wins that we’ve got and the revenue that will drive overall. Okay, well thank you John for your call.

Good day and welcome to Texas Instruments' 2Q 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the Web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue and earnings per share for the quarter were solidly in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, demand for our products continued to be strong in the automotive market and grew in industrial and communications equipment markets. Despite sequential growth, demand in the personal electronics market was down from a year ago.
In our core businesses, Embedded Processing revenue grew 9% and Analog revenue was about even with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margins increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.76.
With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.9 billion, up 7% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30% of revenue, up from 27.4% a year ago.
We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
From a year ago, Analog revenue was about even with growth in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog, was offset by declines in High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 9% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines, led by Processors. Our investments in Embedded continue to build a diverse business of long-lived products that contribute to free cash flow growth over the long term. In our Other segment, revenue declined 4% from a year ago due to calculators, royalties and custom ASIC products, which was partially offset by DLP products.
Now I'll move to provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago.
Automotive demand remained strong, with the majority of sectors growing, led by infotainment. Industrial demand had broad-based growth, with more than half of the sectors growing. Personal electronics declined broadly, led by mobile phone. Communications equipment grew from a year ago, but declined sequentially. And finally, enterprise systems grew.
We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes, taken together, are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.0 billion with 61.2% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 300 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs.
Operating expenses were $805 million, up 2% from a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.29 billion on research and development, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $79 million, all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.
Operating profit was $1.12 billion, or 34.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.7% and for Embedded Processing, 25.0%. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth.
Net income in the second quarter was $779 million, or $0.76 per share.
Now let me comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.07 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 133, consistent with our long-term model of 105 days to 135 days as we stage inventory for expected revenue growth in the third quarter.
Capital expenditures were $158 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.46 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $585 million, or 4.5% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures, including the expansion of our 300-millimeter Analog capacity to be about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.87 billion, or 30.0% of revenue. Free cash flow was 7% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model.
As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested into the business.
As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.
For those who may have missed it, in May, we issued $500 million of six-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.85%. In addition, we've retired $1 billion of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.63 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.22%.
In the second quarter, we paid $382 million in dividends and repurchased $527 million of our stock for a total return of $909 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.07 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3% over the past 12 months and by 42% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitments to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $2.54 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for a variety of uses.
Our orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 2% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, for the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.62 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is unchanged at about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year.
In summary, we believe our second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up.

Thank you. And our first question will come from Chris Danely with Citigroup.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks, guys. Great quarter. So it seems like the revenue was above the midpoint like you said. Can you just maybe talk about the strength you saw, or what was stronger than expectations by segment or by end market?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, Chris. I'll just say across our businesses, I'd just say that most areas performed a bit better than our expectations. Obviously, there's always puts and takes, but in general, that was the case. And obviously, that put us solidly in the upper half of our range.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. And for my follow-up, if we plug in some sort of normal seasonal growth in Q4, it looks like revs will be flat to slightly up. But it looks like OpEx might be up as a percentage this year. Is that true? Can you shed any light on whether that could happen, or it could not happen or what would be the drivers there?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Chris, you said Q4. Did you mean to say Q3?
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
No, we've already got it for Q3, but if we plug in some seasonal growth for Q4 you get revenue around the same level as last year. It looks like OpEx might be a little bit higher as a percent of revenue this year versus last year. A, is that true? Can you comment on that, or talk about the puts and takes on OpEx?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Well, I'll wait 90 days and give you what we think that the Q4 range is going to be for revenue and then we kind of talk about where that is. Right now we'll just focus our comments on 2Q and 3Q if you don't mind, Chris.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Chris. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Sure. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. First, could you give us an idea of – in the current quarter how much personal electronics was down year-over-year? And for Q3, how do you see that trending? Do you still see that business down year-over-year in Q3?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, Stacy, we don't get to that level of detail. I can say that we did see sequential growth as we were expecting to see it. It is, obviously, still down significantly year-on-year, and we really just haven't provided guidance out into third quarter. And again, if there's anything that's moving around that's significant, our practices have been to call that out to provide clarity. So I think with our results coming solidly in the upper half and our guidance that we're providing, we're just not going to that level of detail at this time.
Do you have a follow-on?
Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Yes. Can you give us some idea of gross margin drivers in the quarter? It seems like gross margins came in a little stronger. And how do you see those drivers trending into next year? Do you think gross margins should be up on the higher revenues?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yes, Stacy. The drivers to gross margin in last quarter and going for the foreseeable future are the same things we've been seeing for a while, and that is we're seeing depreciation rolling off, which is clearly giving us an accounting benefit to gross margin, but more importantly, we've got increased production on 300-millimeter, which is considerably more cost effective on a chip level than the equivalent 200-millimeter production. And as we see depreciation continue to roll off, albeit more slowly as we move into future quarters and more production on 300-millimeter, we'll continue to see benefit to gross margins.
So I think that what you've seen going on is just a prelude to what you'll see going on as we look out a little bit further. If you look out further in time, as to what to expect, I think we'd just tell you to do what we've been doing in the past, which is on any delta revenue that you forecast in your model, that falls through around 70%, 75% on average over time, that will give you a pretty good way to anticipate what the company's gross margin will stack up as.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Stacy, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess, first off, CapEx looks like it was a little bit higher a line (13:48) you guys have talked about in the past. Can you just talk about how do you think about it for the rest of the year and at what point you think CapEx that approximates inflation (13:55)?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Amit, you were a little quiet. I think you were saying that CapEx a little higher than in the past?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, that's what I had heard, too. We're having a little bit of trouble hearing you, just so to summarize your question, you were saying CapEx was higher than it has been in the recent past and why is that?
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, sorry. Right. And at what point do you think CapEx is going to approximate depreciation for you guys over time?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Okay. So CapEx is going to be noisy in any one quarter. So it makes most sense to kind of look at it on what we think is a trailing 12-month basis. And over the last 12 months, CapEx was running about – well about 4.5% over last 12 month's revenue. Depreciation has been running about 5.2% to the last 12 months' revenue. So obviously, those will converge at some point, but I don't expect those to converge before the end of 2016. They may converge in any one quarter, but on that trailing 12-month basis, it will take a couple more quarters before we see those meet up. And again, remember our long-term model is to keep our CapEx spending at around 4% of revenue, and that includes the conversion and expansion of our 300-millimeter capacity for Analog production.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Do you have a follow-up, Amit?
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Yeah, if I could just follow up, OpEx I guess at least in the June quarter it looks like it was higher than expected. Sort of compare with what happened in the March quarter if I'm not mistaken. So could you just talk about how do you get OpEx as a percent of sale and what's driving the higher uptick there? It sound like it looks like it's more R&D than anything else in the first half of the year so far.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, I'm not so sure, Amit, it was higher than expected per se, but it was certainly higher than it was last quarter and higher on a year-over-year basis. You've got a couple of things going on there. Sequentially, you've got three full months of pay and benefit increases, so last quarter you only had two months' worth. That's also true year-over-year, by the way. We just got pay and benefit increases.
But also importantly on the R&D as you noted, we have been for a number of quarters now reallocating our internal resources towards more development efforts. So those will be resources that may have been working in manufacturing support or that may have been working in SG&A, and we're re-deploying those resources into development activity and R&D. And we expect to continue doing that for a number of quarters to come. And so consequently you're seeing R&D begin to move up a little bit more than you might see on the G&A line.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Amit. We'll go to the next caller, please.

And next will be C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question to go back to your incremental gross margins and try and maybe dig a little bit deeper in understanding how much is going off of D&A mix utilization, the benefit of 300-millimeter. So if we look at calendar 2016 and things play out seasonal, it looks like $150 million benefit from D&A but another $200 million from those other categories. Is there any way to parse that out and then better understand, go forward, what that might look like for each of those categories' mix utilization 300-millimeter?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, C.J, just to think about that, from another utilization standpoint, frankly, there's no real benefit going on there. The underutilization costs and almost exactly the same for multiple quarters in a row now.
Depreciation has actually come down, so you compare the most recent quarter at $155 million depreciation, the year-ago quarter was $198 million. So you're getting about a $45 million depreciation lift. So really the rest of it's just lower overall manufacturing costs. And again, incrementally we're getting more production on 300-millimeter, which at the die level has a 40% cost benefit for us. So that's an overall 20% improvement to gross profit margin on – or excuse me, 20 – takes gross profit margin up effectively because cost comes down by that amount.
So you've got the combination of all those things weighing together. So again, depreciation down about $45 million 2Q to 2Q on a year-over-year basis. Underutilization charges pretty flat throughout that period. So it's really a conversion to lower cost manufacturing.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Right. And I'll just add for those that may not follow us as closely why 300-millimeter makes a difference, so we've got a footprint manufacturing Analog products at 200-millimeter, and the 300-millimeter we ended last year with about $6 billion of open capacity on 300-millimeter, and the wafer size is bigger and that translates into a lower cost, as Kevin was talking about, at a chip level, where the silicon level is 40% lower. So basically as we build more of our products on 300-millimeter that will help to drive gross margins as well as free cash flow. So C.J., you have a follow-up question?
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Yeah, Dave, that was very helpful. If I could just ask a short-term question. In terms of gross margin into September, will mix be a headwind there or should we say gross margin's at least flat? Thank you.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
C.J., I don't think that mix is really going to play too much of a factor in this. We're going to continue to have more production on 300-millimeter and lower overall manufacturing costs, and it's really just the economics that Dave just mentioned that's going to keep on helping on gross margin going forward.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please.

And our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I wonder if you can give us an update on the Embedded Processing segment? You're showing some nice growth there. Can you talk about where that's coming from, and in particular the old – the previous wireless business's OMAP connectivity, can you talk about growth that you might be seeing there?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, sure, Joe. So year-over-year, as we had said before, we're seeing good growth in all three product lines, and just as a reminder, for 2015 we had three product lines inside of Embedded: microcontrollers, which made up 45% of revenue; processors, again 45%; and connectivity at 10%.
So I'll just say over the last few years, connectivity has been growing very strongly, though it's coming obviously from a much lower revenue base. And there we support a dozen or so connectivity standards, and those products are finding – I'd just say very, very diverse different applications and doing very nicely.
Processors, again, is doing very well. It is being benefited from both the automotive, as well as recovery that we saw inside of comms infrastructure. And then microcontrollers is benefiting from really the industrial market as it is finding very, very diverse application. So that's kind of what that looks like across the board. Do you have a follow-up?
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, that was very helpful. Thank you.
Just separately, I wonder, are there any areas where you're seeing tighter availability or lead time extensions or anything like that across the whole portfolio?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, I'd say that across the board our lead times have remained unchanged and at very, very low levels. So product availability continues to be very good. And both at our distributors as well as for the products that we support through consignment programs or in a classical book shift business. So really no changes on that.
And I'd just also mention that just our on-time delivery, so kind of our metrics to when customers want to have them remain at very, very high level.
So, okay. Thank you, Joe. We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And that question will come from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking the question, and nice job on the results.
Kevin and Dave, I wanted to follow up on Embedded Processing operating margins. For the last couple of years, the company's had the objective to get them higher and you've done a lot on the OpEx side and now for a second consecutive quarter we're in the mid-20%s. Can you put in context where operating margins are now versus, I think, levels that the company would be happy with? Is it possible to get to Analog levels, or are we at optimal levels now with EP?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
So, Craig, on that, I would say that there's nothing inherently different between the Analog and Embedded I'd point to to say why margins would be different. What I would say is that while we won't try to predict margins in the individual segments per se, we're confident that Embedded Processing just like Analog can be a very solid contributor to free cash flow growth over the long haul.
And again, this is largely because the products that we manufacture in that segment have very long market shelf lives, and so you can get a lot of revenue stream off of your R&D that you spend.
You may recall that over the last couple years, ending early last year, we were doing some restructuring activity in Embedded Processing and taken some costs out, and we've been talking for a while now that the real secret to being able to improve the profitability in that area was on revenue growth. And that team has been doing a very good job at turning the results of their efforts into solid revenue growth, and consequently we're seeing the profitability go up. They are committed to continuing in that direction, and so I look forward to seeing what they turn in as we go multiple quarters out.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Do you have a follow-on, Craig?
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Yeah, thanks, Dave. The follow-up is related to Chris's question. You mentioned that the performance of the business was just a little bit better than expected on a broad-based basis in the second quarter. Was that because the order strength in the business was just better than the team thought going into the quarter, or was in fact the business just scoped a little bit more conservatively than it played out? What accounted for the upside versus expectations?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah. So I would – I'd just point to that we've got 55% of our revenue that runs through consignment, so we actually don't get orders there. We get forecasts that get pulled to actual demand. We've got 60% of our revenues that run through distribution and 60% of that is actually on consignment. So our – what we ship, the demand that we ship to is much closer to real time of what customers want and need. So I think very simplistically, they just ended up pulling more, slightly more than what we were initially expecting across a broad range. So if there was something in there that we could point to, one or two things, we would do that, but that's just not the case this time. So, okay. Thank you, Craig. We'll go to the next caller.
Operator
And we'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the strong consistent results. Kevin, I wanted to talk a little bit about OpEx patterns into the calendar third quarter. For the last kind of three years you've had good sequential revenue growth in the calendar third quarter of about 6% and you've been able to take OpEx down on average by about 3% sequentially. And so I'm just kind of curious, is there a seasonal pattern to OpEx that we should think about for the calendar third quarter in general, and specifically how do you see OpEx trending this September?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, John, I think you've said it well in that you do tend to see some patterns similar to the numbers you just recited. Typically, you'll see SG&A and R&D down a bit in third versus second, and part of that is just people taking vacations and so on for the summer holidays.
But I think this quarter you'll continue to see that sort of trend probably in the SG&A area. But I would expect that R&D would continue to increase a little bit as we move forward, dampening the overall decline that you might expect in OpEx. And that again has to do with what I mentioned earlier in the call, that for a number of quarters now, we have been redeploying resources into development activities. And those costs are winding up in R&D as we redeploy those resources.
So as you look into third quarter, again, you're probably going to see that G&A will probably be down again a little bit, but R&D will probably be up some.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Is there a follow-on?
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful. Yeah. As a follow-on, guys, one of the things you guys have always sort of talked about is the consistency of growth here, and not necessarily absolute growth, albeit you've talked about sort of modest share gain expectations every year. And just when I look at the Embedded Processing growth of over 9% year-over-year, to me that clearly is sort of outgrowing the industry and the peers. And so I'm kind of curious, what do you think the cause of that is? How sustainable that is, and kind of should we expect to see continued market share growth within the Embedded segment at these sort of clips?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, John. We'll finish the year before we declare any victory laps on market share gains. And I'd just say that if you look at that business, as well as Analog, you know, we've just had steady share gains. And we've talked about averaging between 30 basis points and 40 basis points per year. But we've had years where we've put up 100 basis point gains in the past. So, again, we don't want to get ahead of where the year will end. We'll wait till the scoreboard is up before we analyze that.
But we – I'd just say that we continue to focus our resources in places where we can develop products that are going to be differentiated, that are going to find a long-lived position in the marketplace. And when you're able to do that, you're able to have a revenue stream in which you're able to build on. And the great thing about both these markets is that share gain doesn't move quickly. And so – but it's just steady share gains over time will make a significant difference to the business model. And we think that that is certainly showing up in the numbers today.
So thanks, John. We'll go to the next caller, please.

And next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Yeah, thank you. Just to start with kind of a bit of a bigger picture question. You talked about some of the forecast visibility from your consignment revenue. Can you talk a little bit about how far out that goes, and what the order patterns are telling you?
And then correspondingly, what have you seen with regard to order rates over the last 90 days as compared to the previous quarter? Are they fairly stable, improving, or declining?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah. So, Chris, it will depend on the customer or distributor. I'd say that typically we'll get – look out on demand out for six months. Sometimes it will be longer, we'll get a longer term forecast for them. But usually they run about six months. Inside of a certain window, those forecasts are deemed as more firm. But that said, they can change, and they can change very quickly. So we can have 100% visibility, but that doesn't mean that those forecasts can't change.
From an order standpoint, I can tell you that during the quarter, we saw orders were higher in May. They increased again in June. That's kind of what happens in a second quarter. And I'd just say that those order rates versus when we were all on a book ship business without consignment certainly were a different signal than what they are today. So we look at those – the orders that we have on the books. We look at the consignment forecasts that we see, and we make judgments based on that and roll that all up to what we provide you in our outlook.
So you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Yes. Thanks. With regard to inventory, it looks like it was down sequentially in days, but I believe it's toward the higher end of your range. Could you talk about your expectations? I suppose that you would expect that to drop as you go to the second half. Do you have a particular target in mind for where you expect the inventory to approach as we exit the year? And then what that implies for production in the second half? I know you often try to level load production given seasonality. Is that still the case this year?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, Chris. I don't really have a specific inventory forecast for you per se. I will just point out a couple things on inventory to kind of keep in mind. Total dollars of inventory are actually down on a year-over-year basis, even though days are up, and that's really a function of the higher profitability that the company's performing at now. When you just do the math at a higher gross margin percent, that same inventory affords more days of potential sales. So that's part of what's going on there.
But as you noted, it is down quarter-over-quarter on a day's basis. And typically going into third quarter, typically tends to be an up revenue quarter for us, and as you mentioned, when we level load the factories, that would anticipate that some of that inventory will be drained as we go through the quarter. But we don't have a specific forecast as to days or dollars. We just expect that will probably drain somewhat going into the third quarter, and then we'll continue to adjust our loadings and our expectation for first quarter and fourth quarter as we continue through the year.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Great. Okay. Thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

And Blayne Curtis with Barclays is next.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the congrats on the good execution. I just want to follow back up on a prior OpEx question, and just how do you think about managing it? Obviously, you've gotten the question probably two years in a row on why R&D as a percent of revenue is low. And it bottomed in 2015, you've grown it faster than revenue. How do you think about over the next year or two going forward? Is there a particular percentage you're managing it to? Or is it a function of where you can get gross margins? How are you thinking about it? And then if you can just talk about where you're deploying these new resources.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Okay, Blayne. So just at kind of a – first at a 50,000-foot level. We've talked in the past about our total OpEx will probably fluctuate between 20% and 30% of revenue, meaning that in weaker markets we might be running at the higher end of that range, in stronger markets we'll run at the lower end of that range. And here in the last couple of years we've been around the middle of that pack, around 23%, 24%, 25% kind of range. So that's kind of a high-level look at OpEx as a whole.
Now more specifically on R&D, when it comes to allocating capital, and R&D is certainly a place where we allocate some of that capital to, it's a pretty important thing for any management team to pay attention to. We take it extremely seriously to make sure that when we do allocate to R&D, we'll allocate in areas that we believe that we can actually develop differentiated products with very long revenue streams and very high margin opportunities. The idea is to maximize the amount of revenue we get on the R&D dollar spent. So it's not a percent per se that we're trying to manage to. It's an opportunity that we're going after.
And as we just talked about earlier in the call, some of our R&D spending is actually moving up a little bit even these past few quarters and will probably to continue to move up in the next few quarters as we are seeing opportunities to reallocate some of our resources from where they have been into development areas for R&D purposes that will just extend the overall availability of our products into new marketplaces. So we really look at opportunistically and not based upon a particular model or a percent of revenue or anything like that.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Do you have a follow-on, Blayne?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Maybe just switching gears to the auto market. There's been concerns all year, but I think the data points have been stronger than not. Just curious, your perspective on that market as you go into September in terms of inventory, and the strength you saw, was that more a function of units, or was it more content gains through (34:44)?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yes. Clearly, what's driving the market today, we believe, is content gains. And if you have visited an auto showroom any time in the last year, that's pretty obvious to see with the new models that are coming out. Our belief is that the automotive sales will fluctuate much like they have in the past and into the future. But certainly, overall, the content gain is what's growing things.
So as Kevin said, when we look at the automotive market we're making investments that will produce revenue 5 years and 10 years and 15 years out into the future. If things were to weaken in that market and we don't know that's going to be next quarter or five years from now when that does, but we know how to handle those types of situations tactically. But it won't really change our investment levels and what we believe will be the drivers for our business and really the industry over the next 5 years and 10 years.
So I hope that helped, Blayne. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

And that question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on your Embedded versus Analog margins. I'm curious, how much of that delta is at a gross margin level, and how much is at an OpEx intensity level? And if it's on a gross margin level, what levers do you have? Is it just that you can move a greater proportion of these products to 300-millimeter? Or – I'm just trying to get a sense for how much improvement you can make in Embedded margins without necessarily depending on sales growth.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, Vivek, I would say we disclosed for, by segment, the revenue and the operating profit, and we don't dig into too many details underneath that as to what's happened between the lines. I would say that the – at the gross margin level, obviously, it does benefit from our continued efforts to lower our manufacturing cost. So that's clearly happening inside there from an OpEx standpoint, we have been reducing OpEx for a couple years, up through about May of last year. We've got that OpEx now mostly at the level that we want it at. So it really is a question of being able to drive revenue growth and get leverage off the OpEx that we have. And that leverage then falls straight through to free cash flow, which is a direct benefit, of course, to our shareholders based upon the formula that we've talked about with capital management. So that's how we tend to look at it, as opposed to trying to force a model on it that the two segments being comparable; we look at what they can actually generate, bottom line.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Thanks, Dave. So maybe you could help us quantify how much of your Analog sales are on 300-millimeter now and how much of your Embedded sales are on 300-millimeter? Thank you.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah. And, Vivek, we talked about in our capital management call, that we ended last year with about $2 billion of our Analog revenues, which were roughly about $8 billion in that year, on 300-millimeter, so approximately 25% of revenue. I will say that when you look at that factory where we're building it, we call it – it's our Richardson Fab, or we call it RFAB for short. That'll support $5 billion of revenue when it's completely full. And if you look at that $5 billion, one of the reasons why we believe that our manufacturing and technology is one of the competitive advantages that we've got is because that $5 billion is significantly larger than any of our Analog competitors that we've got. So that level of scale just doesn't make sense for them.
And beyond RFAB, we've got and qualified our second 300-millimeter factory that we creatively called DMOS6, that just sits a little less than a mile from the office that we're currently in. So I can say that we did qualify that at the end of last year as we were anticipating, and we have revenue-generating wafers that are running through that factory today. So we'll update next year on our capital management call where we stand on that overall utilization. Our intention is to build more product inside of there, but we'll wait until then to update it.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
And just a different part of your question, Vivek, that DMOS6 that Dave was just talking about is shared with Embedded Processing, in fact, so that is where some of the Embedded Processing 300-millimeter production occurs at.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, that's great. Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

The next caller will be Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes. Thank you. Great execution. I guess, the first question that I have is I was hoping you can comment a little bit on what customers are telling you these days as it relates to the consolidation the industry is seeing. I mean, are they coming to you and perhaps asking you to get into certain businesses? Because I assume they must be a little bit concerned about there being less and less suppliers. Just curious if some of those discussions have already happened with your customers?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
The only time that we had a conversation with our customers about consolidation was when we acquired National Semiconductor, and at that point in time, we had a lot of customers congratulate us and pleased that we were doing it because they knew we were friendly with business terms. Aside from that, I cannot point to any example of a customer coming to us and saying anything about the consolidation going on in the industry and what they think we should be doing about it.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, and I'll just add to that, Tore. If you think of the business model that we're trying to put together, it's not focused on one customer or one or two products, where if you saw consolidation as an OEM, you might have significant concerns and maybe go to one of those companies' competitors. So I think to a large extent, that's probably why we don't have those overall concerns. Obviously, as you know, the Analog market continues to be extremely fragmented both from a customer base, as well as suppliers, even with the consolidation that we've seen. You have a follow-up, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yeah, that's really helpful. As a follow-up, just back to the near-term environment, so you talked about the sell-throughs probably being a bit better than expected. Do you think that was basically customers being too conservative? Or do you think customers are actually seeing strengthening in demand on their end?
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Well, I would just say, Tore, overall I think that we're operating in a similar macro environment to what we've seen in actually recent years, and that's just an environment that I'd say that it's okay, if I used one word to describe it. It's not really strong. It's not really weak, and we're operating in that type of environment.
I think the benefit of us having consignment and having consignment with distribution is that our revenues more closely match that demand. That doesn't mean that they can't change quickly in the future at some point, but certainly we're shipping what we believe or what we know for sure on that portion of demand is – or those shipments is very, very close to actual demand and consumption.
So thank you, Tore. And with that, we've got time for one more caller.
Operator
Sure. And that question will come from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you so much. I guess I had two. First of all, can you talk a little bit about Brexit? I know that it seems like you're not seeing any impact from it, but can you talk just a little bit about whether you saw any perturbations around it? Or you've seen any stints? Or sort of what might worry you with anything around Brexit going forward?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Tim, I would say that we really – it's pretty much impossible for us to be able to make a comment directly on that. Indications I've seen, the British economy is probably about 4% of the global GDP, so even if there's a wobble inside that economy, it's going to be really hard for us to be able to detect it.
I would say that what we really do see is our customers are global. They sell globally, and it's a larger macro environment that we're in. And as Dave said a few minutes ago, that macro environment has been, and we believe will continue to be relatively slow, and so it's up to us to execute as best we can inside of it to gain market share.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
You follow, Tim?
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Got it. And then – yeah, yeah. And then just back to personal electronics, I'm going to ask it sort of a little bit of a different way. I think you said last call that it would be a little less of a headwind in the second quarter than it was in Q1, and it sounds like it was less of a year-over-year headwind. Can you commit at least to it being even less of a headwind in the third calendar quarter? I guess the reason why I ask is because it's a pretty big hockey stick as this all normalizes, so I'm just trying to sort of figure out when that hockey stick is going to come. Thanks.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah. Well, I won't try to get that granular on any one customer or any one market in providing a forecast. I'll just say that typically and what we saw last year, certainly PE had a very strong back half, right? And we saw the demand weaken very, very late in the quarter, so we've seen a headwind year-on-year the last two quarters as we described. So I won't put together a forecast for you in the second half, but I'd just point out that we did have a very strong second half last year.
David Pahl - Vice President & Head of Investor Relations
So I hope that helps a little bit. And with that, we will wrap up, and thank you for joining us today. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments 1Q16 Earnings Release Conference.
At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web as well.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue for the quarter was in the upper half of our expected range. Compared with the year ago, notable market activity for our products included continuing strength in automotive as well as improvement in the industrial and communications equipment. Revenue was down 5% due to the weakness in personal electronics market, which declined as expected. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing comprised 87% of first quarter revenue. Analog revenue declined 8%, while embedded processing revenue grew 8%. 
Earnings per share were $0.65.
With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of our business model.
In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $547 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $3.7 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.4% of revenue, up from 27.3% a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.
We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to our investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
Analog revenue decreased 8% from a year ago. The decline was primarily due to high volume, analog and logic. Power management and high-performance analog also declined, while Silicon Valley analog grew.
Embedded processing revenue increased 8% from a year ago due to growth in all three product lines, led by processors. Our investments in embedded are translating into tangible results as this quarter's revenue is a record.
In our other segment, revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products.
Compared with a year ago, distributor resales decreased 4% due to lower demand and personal electronics that I described earlier. Inventory increased a couple of days to about 4-1/2 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which, together, drive high customer service metric. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program.
Now provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end-market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remained very strong driven by infotainment and hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain systems. Industrial demand strengthened broadly with most sectors growing.
Within personal electronics, we had a portion of demand that declined about $150 million as expected. Overall personal electronics was down more than that, primarily due to mobile phones.
Communications equipment was about even from a year ago, an improvement from last quarter when it was down about 15%. And finally, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus on making our company stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies able to -- capable of long-term free cash flow growth.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone.
Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion and was 60.6% of revenue, a new record. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 290 basis points, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, as well as a higher percentage of more profitable products.
Operating expenses were $774 million, about even with the year-ago period. Over the last 12 months we've invested $1.27 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which were for the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.
Operating profit was $968 million or 32.2% of revenue. Operating profit was up 1% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 36.1%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 25.0%, 670 basis points higher than a year ago, as we focused our investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions.
Net income in the first quarter was $668 million or $0.65 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.
Cash flow from operations was $547 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 137, as we staged our inventory for increased shipments in the second quarter. Also included were three to four days of inventory associated with a portion of the personal electronics market that started to flow late in the fourth quarter. We expect to ship this material later this year.
Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.21 billion, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $552 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which include the expansion of our 300-millimeter analog capacity.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.65 billion or 28.4% of revenue. Free cash flow was 1% higher than a year ago. This growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only for this return to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter we paid $383 million in dividends and repurchased $630 million of our stock for a total of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned to shareholders in the past 12 months was $4.17 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.6% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004 when we initiated a program designed to produce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments with our US entities owning the 80% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses.
Our orders in the quarter were $3.09 billion, down 4% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, for the second quarter we expect revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.77. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter to the third quarter of 2019. They'll then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.
So in summary, we believe our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. And with that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
We'll go first to the line of Romit Shah. Please go ahead.
Romit Shah - Nomura
Yes, thank you, and excellent results. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's driving the revenues in Q2 by end-market?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, Romit. We don't typically provide a forecast by end-market. However, if there's any large shifts, we'll talk about that, you know, much like we did last quarter within a sector in personal electronics. I can say that that demand we would expect to grow sequentially, but it will be down significantly from a year ago. And I'd also say that, outside of that, we would expect the rest of our business to grow both sequentially and year over year.
Romit Shah - Nomura
Okay. And yeah, just -- yeah, I know that the conversation to 300-millimeter has been an important part of the improvement in margin profile, and I was wondering if you could just update us on how much of the portfolio is converted to 300 and how much is left.
Kevin March
Romit, I'll go ahead and talk to that. Roughly a quarter of our analog revenue was generated on 300 millimeter last year. We have total internal capability about $8 billion, so we're using about a quarter of that capability at this point in time.
Just to remind everyone else who's listening, the reason the 300 millimeter is so important to us is really the economics at the factory level. We get about 2.3 times as many chips per wafer on a 300 millimeter versus the 200 millimeter. The wafer processing cost is about 1.4 times as much. So if you do the math, that means the actual die cost is only about 60% as much on a 300 millimeter as a 200 millimeter wafer.
When you kind of take that all the way through to finished goods, all things being equal we wind up with a higher gross margin on those chips to manufacture 300 millimeter. So that's increasingly important to us.
As we look out in the future, again we've got about probably $6 billion of growth capacity in 300 millimeter and we continue to increase our loadings in that space. In fact on a year-over-year basis we actually had more starts on 300 millimeter than a year ago.
Dave Pahl
Good. And I'll just add to Kevin's comment, that as we reported last quarter, we qualified our second 300 millimeter fab, which is DMOS 6, and we do have product running in that fab today. So, thank you, Romit. We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
I'll take our next question from the line of John Pitzer. Please go ahead, your line is open.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yeah, good afternoon guys. Solid execution as always.
I guess, could you talk a little bit about the embedded processing op margin improvements? If memory serves me correct, when you got out of the wireless business, you didn't get out of all the costs and you put a lot of that cost into the embedded processing market. If I look at sort of the incremental margin, op margin sequentially, it's greater than 60%. Are we sort of at a tipping point here with that kind of the incremental op margin we should start to see about this business? And is there any reason why the embedded op margin shouldn't converge with the analog op margins over time?
Kevin March
Yeah, John. You might recall was for the year ago we were still in the process of winding up some restructuring items in the embedded processing segment. That finished about the middle of the second quarter, that bled over into the middle of the second quarter. [Inaudible] now we're seeing the benefit of those cost restructurings.
The margin improvement that we'll see [inaudible] solid 25% operating profit a quarter, and that's really much closer to what we expect from that business segment. As you noted, we had about, quarter over quarter, about a 62% pull-through [ph] to operating profit from the revenue growth. And as we go forward, the focus of that division will be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost management, but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue. So that it can continue to drop through more profit as we go forward.
I won't attempt to characterize whether or not it achieves the same sort of levels as analog, but we are confident there remains room of improvement in that overall P&L, primarily from continued cost containment and a drive towards revenue growth.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
You mentioned, as my follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the inventory growth you saw in the March quarter. Just kind of curious how long it takes to get back closer to trend, as you exit June, would you expect to see days closer to your trend line, or how should we think about that?
Kevin March
Yeah. I think what's actually interesting, John, is our dollars of inventory are actually down year over year. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our days of inventory were up, and that's up on the expectation of increased shipments in the second quarter. And plus there's a few extra days that are inside that 1Q inventory as a result of the slowdown in personal electronics that we mentioned 90 days ago.
We expect that material is going to ship over the balance of the year. And between the increased shipments in 2Q and the shipments of that personal electronics material, we'll see the days of inventory drift back down comfortably inside our model, very similar to what we saw last year. If you go back and take a look last year, we were also a little bit higher in the first quarter, anticipation of second quarter growth, and then days drifted down as we came through the year.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Participant
Hi. This is Charles [ph] on for Toshiya. Your Q2 guide at the midpoint, flat to down year-over-year growth, I was kind of wondering when you expect to kind of return to growth and what the drivers of that will be.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. So I think if you look at the midpoint, you're right, the year-over-year growth would be down about 1%. As we talked about before, we, on a year-over-year basis, we'll still have the growth impacted due to the weakness inside of personal electronics. Outside of that, we expect to see our businesses growing both sequentially and year on year, and again I think that we're on a good position to capitalize on the trends of industrial and automotive. We think longer term that that's where the growth in our industry will come from. And just as a reminder, we had last year about 46% of our revenues driven by there. So we feel good with where our products are positioned.
Unidentified Participant
Got it. And then gross margin performance was strong, if you want. Outside of lower depreciation and incremental 300 millimeter revenues, where are the other factors that are going to drive upside from here?
Kevin March
Well, you hit two important ones. So we have lower manufacturing costs year over year, driven by, as you mentioned, lower depreciation and increased 300 millimeter wafer starts. But we also had a retromix of overall products. As Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, industrial was up very solidly for us, and in the industrial space we enjoy a very nice mix of overall profitability. So you have that combination of events going on.
And again, to Dave's comments a moment ago, as we continue to see content growth in industrial and automotive, we would expect to continue to see an improvement on our mix from a profitability standpoint too as we look out over the quarters and years. So it's all coming together very nicely for us right now.
Dave Pahl
Okay, great. Thank you. And we'll go to our next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon. Please go ahead.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
In the quarter, OpEx came in a little higher. I was wondering if you could tell us the driver, what drove that, and what your thoughts are for OpEx for Q2.
Kevin March
Yes, Stacy, OpEx did come in a little bit higher than what we had planned for. There really wasn't any one thing that drove that. There's just a number of small things that were being taken care of in the quarter.
As we look into second quarter, recall that 1Q includes about two months' worth of our annual pay and benefit increases. If you look into 2Q you'll need to account for that, that we would have the full three months of pay and benefit increases. I'd expect the change quarter to quarter to be very similar to what you saw last year.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Got it. Thank you, that's helpful. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit into the comm infrastructure impact on both embedded processing as well as others. So, embedded dropped 8% year over year. You noted within your other business that your ASIC, custom ASICs, are down year over year. I think both of those tend to be driven very highly by comm infrastructure. Can you help us understand the differential between those two businesses? Is one of them eating the other for example?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. So, first, let me talk about our embedded business. So, our embedded business, as you remember, has three product lines inside of it. Micro-controllers and processors are both about 45% of that revenue, and connectivity makes up about 10% of that revenue. So we saw growth in all three of those businesses, they all grew very nicely. But it was led by processors.
So our communications infrastructure, processors would be inside of that business, but we also sell automotive products that are inside of that business that drove that growth.
The -- in the other business, the custom ASIC business, I'll just say that we saw a different mix of products to customers, so it's not always the same. We've got some customers where we only sell both embedded and analog into those customers. So -- and that said, this is a reminder longer term, we do expect that the custom ASIC business will decline, because that functionality is being absorbed into our SOCs inside of the embedded business, so. Thank you --
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you guys.
Dave Pahl
-- Stacy. We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital
Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just talk about the outperformance in gross margin? You said 300 millimeters. I was just curious what the utilization rates are. And as you look into Q2, it seems that guidance implies kind of sustaining at that level. I just want to make sure that was right and what you're expecting to do with utilizations there.
Kevin March
Yeah, the utilizations actually haven't changed that much in a number of quarters and we don't expect it to change much in the next quarter or two either. The amount of wafers that we're starting are pretty consistent as we go across the quarters. And Blayne, you can kind of see that in -- when our days of inventory is up in 1Q, we're building for increased shipments in 2Q that allows us to run the factories at pretty close to similar utilizations quarter over quarter, rather than ramping them up and down to meet in-quarter demand. So I wouldn't expect utilization to change that much going into the next couple of quarters just as it hasn't in the last number of quarters.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital
Got you. And then just my follow-up, you had a correction in consumer as you pointed out. As you look into the back half of the year, you said you expected to sell through. So do you expect your content in those types of [ph] applications to be roughly similar this year and therefore you should see a similar ramp like you did last year?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, we haven't given color on how much content we have. I'll just say that, when we do engage where we like to be able to engage inside of personal electronics, those types of products that we'll sell across multiple generations of products, and that's not always the case on every product that we make an investment in, but that's where we want to steer our investment dollars. So we're confident that, as we build that inventory, that we'll have demand in the back half. We won't try to predict at this point what that demand will look like, so.
Thank you, Blayne, and good to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the site of Harlan Sur. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.
Another solid showing by the embedded business. You pointed out particular strength in processors, I think you guys talked about comms as a driver there, and maybe some automotive. But your MCU products also grew nicely year over year. Maybe you can just give us some insights on the end-market/applications that drove the growth in that sub-segment.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. You know, our MCU business is really a great business that we're building. And as you know, we've been investing in that business for some time. We've got and continued to invest both in TI-based architectures as well as ARM-based architectures, and we've got customers that want to have both of those. And we continue to be selective on where we make those investments.
Part of the, you know, the way that you differentiate those products is by having peripherals that are optimized for different types of applications. We developed micro-controllers that are targeted for ultra-low-power battery-backed operations that'll be in-fielded for, in some cases, decades, as well as very high-performance-based microcontrollers, so. And we've got very strong connectivity solutions, both wired, but as well as wireless. And that crosses over into our connectivity business that we've got there and that we support over a dozen different interface or wireless standards inside of that business.
So, again, very, very broad-based, and we really are encouraged by the results of that business.
You have a follow-on, Harlan?
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan
Yeah. But in the industrial markets, which was obviously an area of strength for you guys in the March quarter, you guys have talked previously about servicing like I think 14 different sub-segments, so, very broad.
Dave Pahl
You're correct.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan
You've also talked about content gains in industrial, which is kind of a similar dynamic to the automotive segment. Any of those sub-segments within industrial that are showing more of a bias towards more dollar content gains on a go-forward basis?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, I think, Harlan, the one nice thing about automotive is we can more easily identify what unit SAR growth is and there's enough analysts that follow that market that we can track with the semiconductor content gain. And there we think that there's probably somewhere around $350 on average that sells into an automotive. That's a number that's been growing very nicely.
When I look at that, that's probably about 1% of the average sales price of a car, so it's not too hard to imagine that that number will continue to grow and grow significantly over the future. When you contrast that to industrial, and we think we're in the very early stages of maybe where we were three, five years ago in the automotive market with industrial, you really can't do that same type of analysis, unfortunately, because we've got 14 different sectors that we sell into. Underneath that there are literally hundreds of different end equipment that we track and develop solutions for. And there's just a very, very wide variety of applications. So we can see it going on.
And the beauty of it is it's not just one thing. It really is a growth on a very broad basis. And I think that that's reflected in our numbers, not only this quarter but it's been reflected in the numbers for a number of quarters now. So we really look forward to that opportunity in the future.
Okay, Harlan. Thank you. And we'll move on to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. One more on gross margins. Is the 60.6% the new baseline and we should model the flow-through from this level, or are there any mix benefits that are helping you in the first half that might reverse when the smartphone shipments start to ramp in the second half?
Kevin March
Well, you'll have several things going on across that. That's a pretty tough call to make and more time to get too precise.
We would expect industrial and automotive to continue to be a growing portion of our revenue over time. That's where we're focusing our attention, especially R&D dollars. We also expect more starts, as we look out into the future, proportionately more starts on 300 millimeter, which is lower cost wafers. We would also expect the depreciation and declines that we've been seeing this past year to continue, albeit at a slower pace than what we've seen in the last few quarters. So those will give you tailwinds, so even if you do have some of these other products start back up, [inaudible] mix going on inside there that these margins that we're operating at right now are probably representative of what the portfolio can do for our shareholders.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. [Inaudible] Kevin. And as my follow-up, you mentioned that sales growth in Q1 plus what you're guiding to Q2, excluding, I don't recall whether you said personal electronics or just your largest customer, that sales growth is actually up year on year. Could you help us quantify what that growth trend is versus last year?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, Vivek, we're not being that precise. We just wanted to give some color generally that, you know, where we had that headwind and the demand changing late in the fourth quarter, that that portion of our demand inside of personal electronics, that we expect that it will grow sequentially but be down significantly year over year. And we just haven't gotten more precise than that, so.
Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll move on to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks for letting me ask the question guys. I guess the first question would be, your first quarter came in at the high end of the range. Can you just talk about what was the positive surprise in the quarter? And maybe associated with that, Dave, I think in the past you have given sequential end-market performance to match what you've given and then year over year, if that helps to answer both questions, that will be great.
Dave Pahl
Yes. So again as we had said earlier, that portion of demand where we saw weakness came in about as we expected. The strength was more broad-based, and we continue to, obviously, to see strength in automotive and then the improvement in industrial and comms equipment. So, very, very broad-based strength that we saw.
So the second part of your question was sequentially. What we saw from the trends there, no surprise that automotive remained very strong, and it was driven by infotainment as well as the hybrid electric and powertrain systems. Industrial, again we had growth across almost every sector inside of industrial. Personal electronics down, with most sectors declining. And comms equipment was up sequentially, and that was the third quarter in a row that it actually grew. And then enterprise systems was up due to projectors.
So, did you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Yeah, I'll make it quick. And you just talked about the comms side, the third quarter in a row it's been up. Generally, how do you think about that versus where we are after earning a ton of inventory and now coming back, are we to the point where we're shipping to end-demand and then now we can grow or shrink with that, or is there some other dynamics going on?
Dave Pahl
Can you repeat the first part of the question? Because you just cut out a little bit on our side.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Sure, I'm sorry. So you said your comms business was actually up for the third quarter in a row.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Obviously that had fallen due to the end-market before that.
Dave Pahl
Yeah.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So the question is, do you think you're back to shipping to end-demand and what do you view to be the growth trajectory of that business longer term?
Dave Pahl
Yup. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I would say that, you know, that business, as you know, Ross, has always remained choppy, and we had a very strong period of growth going back a year ago, followed by declines that we saw last year. It's just, you know, it's really tough to be able to predict what's going to happen in that market. And we just positioned product and inventory to be able to respond if that demand will continue to strengthen. And if it doesn't, we know how to react in that environment too.
So it still continues to be a really good business for us. We continue to make investments in it. And we just know that it'll be choppy.
Longer term, we don't view it as a market that will be a growth. We don't think that operators will take their CapEx spending up over the next 5, 10, 15 years. But we do think that there will continue to be shifts in how they spend that money. So we continue to make investments where we believe that that growth will be in the future. So, thank you very much and we'll move to the next caller please.
Operator
Yes. We'll take our next question from the site of Chris Danley. Please go ahead.
Chris Danley - Citi
Hey. Thanks guys. I apologize if these questions have been asked before. I got on here late, I was listening to Zylex [ph] slamming my head against my desk.
It sounds like you're guiding for a roughly seasonal, slightly below seasonal environment. If you could just kind of compare now versus a quarter ago, versus a year ago or the last six months how you feel overall about the overall environment. Is it seasonal, a little below seasonal, better than seasonal, getting better, getting worse? Any comments there?
Dave Pahl
Well, I'd just make the observation that we believe we're just continuing to operate in a very similar macro-environment that we've seen in the last few quarters and even in the recent years. And our guidance obviously is our best estimate of how we'll perform. So we try to stay away from making any precise comments on what a seasonal quarter looks like. As you know, Chris, just -- because if you look at the numbers, there's usually a pretty wide variation on what an average would tell you that it would be.
So again, just very similar macro-environment to what we've seen.
You have a follow-up?
Chris Danley - Citi
Yeah. Real quick, just on channel inventory and distribution inventory. I think you said that channel inventory was up a couple of days, around 4-1/2 weeks. Do you expect channel inventory or disti inventory to go up again in Q2? And then if you could just give us kind of the range that channel inventory/disti inventory has been in for the last, call it, two or three years, is this basically the bottom or a little off the bottom or closer to the peak, or where would that be?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Well, we've, as you know, we've, several years ago, implemented our consignment program, so I think we still continue to learn what the right level in that -- in the channel will be. And I'd just say that if we could actually convert all of our shipments and distributions to consignment and carry that inventory ourselves, we'd actually prefer to do that. So if anything, we'd encourage our distributors to take advantage of those programs.
We've operated I'd say around four weeks to 4-1/2 weeks I think for some time. That number probably, you know, somewhere in that range, even if it drifted up a little bit, it always just depends on the products that's out there and the speed at which it turns. But we've got other peers that measure the inventory in months, and not weeks. So we're very, you know, efficient on how we use that channel. And it works out really well for both of us and our distributor partners. So we feel very good about where that level is overall. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller please.
Chris Danley - Citi
Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess, question from me, I think the lower depreciation helped you guys on the gross margins about 130 basis points year over year. Do you think that magnitude can sustain throughout calendar 2016 or should we think about depreciation dollars to be more of a flat [inaudible]?
Kevin March
I made a comment a few minutes ago that the rate of depreciation, decline, that we have seen over the past year is -- will slow down meaningfully as we go into 2016. Recall that, from a capital spending standpoint, our model is to spend about 4% of our revenues on CapEx, which we have been doing for the last couple of years, and we expect to continue this year. Our depreciation runs more than 4%, so clearly they'll have to converge at some point. Our depreciable life on most of our equipment is five years. And you may recall that it was about five years ago when we brought on several new factories, one in Izu [ph], some equipment to be brought in to our fab here in the Dallas area, and a factory we bought in China.
And so we're seeing those depreciation occurrence roll down now. So the rate of the decline that we saw over the last few quarters this past year will slow down, although it will still decline as we go into 2016.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets
Got it. And if I just follow up, I think you guys have about a billion dollars of debt that's due in the month of May. Is the thought process to just pay that off with cash on hand and roll it forward, and what would that implication have for your interest expense line as you go forward?
Kevin March
Well, if we pay it off, the interest expense will clearly decline. But I expect that we'll probably do what we've done similarly in the last couple of cycles on this where we have, if the interest rates are favorable by the time we go back into the market, we'll likely pay off a portion and roll the balance into a new issue. In either case, whether we pay off the entire amount or just pay off a portion, roll over the balance, I would expect interest cost will decline by several million dollars a quarter.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Please go ahead, Tore Svanberg, your line is open.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus
Yes, thank you. So, Silicon Valley Analog was up year over year, and that -- I mean that's better than the industry, better than your peers. Was that mainly due to industrial and automotive strength or were there some shared gains, all the things going on there?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Tore, SVA does have a good exposure to both industrial and automotive, and that certainly helped that business.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus
Okay. And as my follow-up for Kevin -- Kevin, do you have a CapEx number for us for this year or should we just take 4% of whatever revenue we come up with?
Kevin March
Well, keep it simple, just take 4% of your expected revenue number and you're going to be pretty close to what we're spending.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus
All right. Sounds good. Great job guys. Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Tore. We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
And we'll go next to the line of Ambrish Srivastava. Please go ahead.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Hi. Thank you. I had a question on the automotive business. Dave, we haven't talked about the momentum that you guys seem to be witnessing here. Big, sizable business, bigger than your peers, and year after year, just like the rest of the business, it's boring, but it grows. So the question I had was, where are the new opportunities that you guys are now designed if we were to look at where automotive to TI was, say, a couple of years ago? So, what should we be thinking over the next couple of years? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Sure, Ambrish. Yeah. The automotive business that we're building continues to be very, very broad-based. So we've got strong participation in both analog as well as embedded. Inside of embedded we've got both processors and microcontrollers, as well as even some connectivity designs inside of that business.
From an analog standpoint, it actually is very, very broad-based. And one of the things that we've been focused on is broadening the number of business units that the company participates in automotive. And I think if you went back five, ten years ago, we might have had one or two business units participating in that marketplace. And today, out of our 70 or so different business units, I think over half of them actually ship products into that marketplace. So it's very, very broad-based.
We've got five what we call sectors that make up the automotive market. And again the largest one is not more than mid-single-digit as a percentage of our revenue last year. So they are -- the five segments are infotainment and cluster [inaudible] safety, advanced driver, assist systems or ADAS as it's known, body electronics which also includes lighting, and then the hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain.
So we've seen growth across all of those sectors, very, very robust growth and a very broad range [ph].
So you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
No, that was it for me, Dave. Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Operator, we've got time for one more caller.
Operator
Okay. We will take our final question from the line of William Stein. Please go ahead, sir.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Hi, great. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Dave, around the middle of last year I think was the first time you highlighted the potential for a 10% customer, and maybe we'd been sort of dancing around this point, but I wonder if you expect that that customer will repeat at a similar magnitude in this year.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. You know, that's a projection that I won't make on today's call. I think that they and all of our customers, we've got teams that work very, very hard to get products designed into. And with that largest customer, as we talked about before, we sell them hundreds of products, we participate in all of their major platforms. And of course the revenue would always be skewed where they ship their products, and I think they've publicly reported that about two-thirds of their revenues would be in phones. So our revenues will mirror those types of shipments.
So we've got good growth in automotive, we've got -- we're seeing strengthening and broad strengthening inside of industrial. And that's a trend we'll see, how those trends continue for the balance of the year. There's a lot of time between now and the end of the year. And then we'll see what happens inside of personal electronics as well, so.
You have a follow-on Will?
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Yeah, one on capacity if I can. I'm wondering if you acquired any capacity as you do periodically and if there's any update on the planned fab closure in Scotland?
Kevin March
Yeah, William, I'll go ahead and answer that one. We have been -- we continue to acquire capacity. No new factories here lately, but we do continue to pick up equipment that was quite expensive new for pretty good prices when you buy them the way we buy them.
As it relates to the closure of the factory in Scotland, as a reminder, we expect that factory will not close before the end of 2018, as it has been with other factories in the past, when we close those things, they either take a couple of years. As you slowly do lifetime builds on the inventory, and on certain other parts of those factories you'll recall other existing factories. And that's just a multiyear effort.
So it's progressing as plan and we again don't expect it to actually complete until about the end of 2018.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you very much, Will. And thank you all for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

We'd like to thank everybody for their participation. Please feel free to disconnect your line at any time.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments 4Q 2015 and 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2015 and 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars.
We plan to hold a call on February 9 at 10 a.m. Central Time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done in the past, Kevin March and I will provide insight into our strategy and we'll also answer some of the most frequently asked questions.
Now, I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago and was in line with our expectations, even though we experienced slowing demand within a sector of the personal electronics market late in the quarter. Despite that, overall demand was about as expected. I'll elaborate in a few moments.
Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing performed well in the quarter and comprised 87% of fourth quarter revenue. Earnings per share were $0.80 in the quarter and included a $0.09 benefit for two items that were not in our outlook. These two items were a $0.05 net tax benefit and $0.04 for restructuring charges, other.
With that backdrop, let me move into the details of our performance, which even in the face of weaker demand within the sector of personal electronics market, continues to illustrate the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.7 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up from 26.9% a year ago, and consistent with our target range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from the breadth and differentiation of our product portfolio and from the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300 millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2015, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
Turning to our segments, Analog revenue decreased 2% from a year-ago quarter. Power management, high performance analog and Silicon Valley Analog declined while high volume analog and logic grew. Embedded Processing revenue increased 4% from year-ago quarter due to connectivity and microcontrollers. Processors declined. In our Other segment, revenue declined 13% from year-ago quarter due to custom ASIC and DLP products.
Compared with the year-ago quarter, distribution resales decreased by 2%. Distributor inventory decreased about 1 day compared with a year ago to just above 4 weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times. Together, these continue to drive high customer service metrics.
For the year in total, Analog and Embedded revenue grew a combined 3% despite significant headwinds in wireless infrastructure and foreign currency exchange rates. Analog was up 3% and Embedded was up 2%. In total, Analog and Embedded were 86% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 83% in 2014. Based on data through November, we gained market share in Analog for the sixth consecutive year, and held our share gains in Embedded Processing.
I'll turn now to our end market estimates for 2015. As a reminder, we provide this estimate annually of TI's revenue by the end markets our customers sell into. We break this into six categories: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, where this will include products such as PCs, phones and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators and royalties.
Industrial and automotive combined were 46% of TI's revenue, up a couple of percentage points from last year due to automotive strength. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue, automotive 15%, personal electronics 30%, communications equipment 13%, enterprise systems 6% and other 5%. Of note, Apple, whose revenue is within personal electronics market, contributed approximately 11% of our revenue in 2015.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.87 billion, a decline of 2% versus a year ago due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. As a percent of revenue, gross profit set a new record of 58.5%.
Operating expenses for the quarter totaled $711 million, down $29 million from a year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan, partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges were $81 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense.
Restructuring charges other was $68 million, which included gains on sales of two properties. It also included a $17 million charge in preparation for the closure of a site, which we announced today in our earnings release. We anticipate about $2 million of quarterly charges through the fourth quarter of 2018 for a total charge of about $40 million. We expect the transition to more cost-effective 200 millimeter fabs to take about three years and result in annualized savings of about $35 million per year.
Operating profit was $1.14 billion, or 35.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 4% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 38.0%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 23.4%, 6 percentage points higher than a year ago as we continue to focus investments on our best growth opportunities.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $836 million, or $0.80 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 net tax benefit primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, and a net benefit of $0.04 from restructuring other charges.
I'll now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.43 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 115, up 4 days sequentially and down 2 days from a year ago. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model in our capital management call on Tuesday, February 9.
Capital expenditures were $164 million in the quarter. In 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.27 billion, up 10% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $551 million, or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300 millimeter analog capacity, on which we will provide an update in our capital management call in February.
Free cash flow for the year was $3.72 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28.6% of revenue, up 170 basis points from a year ago. Our free cash flow growth reflects the continued strength of our business model. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercise of equity compensation minus any net debt retirement.
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $386 million in dividends and repurchased $627 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in 2015 was $4.19 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.4% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004, when we initiated our repurchase program designed to reduce our share count. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices, which are designed to make cash available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.22 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that cash onshore, making it available to return to shareholders.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.10 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.85 billion to $3.09 billion in the first quarter. This includes significantly weaker demand within the sector of the personal electronics market. Specifically, we expect a year-over-year decline of about $150 million within the sector of our personal electronics revenue. Except for this area of weakness, our expectations for the remainder of our business are about even with the year-ago quarter.
We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million per quarter through the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2016 is about 30% and this is the tax rate that you should use for the first quarter and for the year.
In closing, I'll note that growth in our industry in 2015 was slower than we expected when we came into the year. However, our unique advantages in manufacturing and technology, portfolio breadth, market reach, and our diverse and long-lived product positions enabled important milestones in the year. These included expansion of 300 millimeter analog production, gross margin improvement of 130 basis points to a new record level, operating margin improvements of 260 basis points, and free cash flow margin improvement of 170 basis points to a new record level.
We will continue to feed our unique advantages through disciplined capital allocation and focus on the best growth opportunities, which I believe will enable us to continue to improve. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
"
2016-01-27,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. And we'll go to our first question from Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey thanks, guys. Can you just divulge to us the market on personal electronics that is causing all the weakness? And if it is handsets, which probably doesn't come as a huge surprise. Maybe also comment on the other end markets, especially PCs where some of the other semiconductor companies have talked about a little bit of weakening in PCs and what you guys are seeing in that end market.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Okay, Chris. The sector where we saw the weaknesses you were guessing is mobile phones and we did see that sector weaken late in the quarter, in the back half of the month of December. If I just take and look at for the year how our end markets did, I'll put that into perspective. I'll start with an area of strength in automotive. That grew in the mid teens. Most of the sectors inside of that growing, growing double-digits.
Industrial revenue was about even for the year and we had about half of the sectors there were increasing, offset by the others. Personal electronics, as we've just talked about, grew single-digits. I'll note that we had certainly growth in one customer that grew significantly that year, but that was primarily offset by declines in others. So therefore our percentage of our revenue in personal electronics really didn't change too much. It went from 29% last year to 30% this year.
Communications equipment was down 20%. And that was primarily driven by wireless infrastructure and that was down around 30% for the year. And then finally, enterprise systems was down slightly due to projectors. So with that said, Chris, I think as we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks, outside of that one area of weakness, everything else came in about as we had expected. So that would be inclusive of PCs and the other areas that you talked about. You have a follow on?
Operator
We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Okay, Chris, if you have – go ahead, John.
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah thanks, guys. Just to follow up, you talked about Apple being an 11% customer for the full year. I'm wondering if you could talk about the linearity of that percentage as the year progressed. Did they exit the year as a larger customer? And as you think about the weakness in Q1 in smartphones, do you feel like you're at a build level that's significantly below sell-through so Q1 will represent a bottom in that weakness? Or how do you handicap that?
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, so our revenue profile inside of personal electronics obviously will be more back half-weighted. As that customer did well in the marketplace, obviously our revenues would be reflective of that. I could point out that we sell very diverse set of products to that customer and in fact, hundreds of products to it and products in every major platform. That said, I think that the revenues of that customer reported to be somewhere around two-thirds of it is in smartphones, and you'd expect, since we've got a pretty diverse position across the customer, our revenues would be very similar.
So, and certainly, I think that whenever you have a fairly significant change in demand of any customer, their supply chain considerations where you've got different pieces of inventory sitting inside of that supply chain, we happen to be on the beginning part of that supply chain. So I won't try to handicap where that is. That's where we think the demand will come in in first quarter and we'll see. We'll make a prediction on second quarter later.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, I might just add on that demand profile. We did discuss that we expect about $150 million year-over-year decline attributable to this particular sector in personal electronics. The rest will be about even with last year.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Right, good point. John, do you have a follow-up?
John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah, Kevin, just to follow-up on that. With the rest of the business even from last year, there's clearly a lot of investor angst about the macro in general. And clearly, if you look at your business profile throughout 2015 and excluded Apple, you saw some weakness in the rest of your business starting in the June quarter. You'd had a couple of quarters of year-over-year declines in total revenue, even as personal electronics has done strongly. And so when you look at the macro concerns that are out there, do you feel like that that's been fully reflected in the June, September, December numbers, and that you're now coming out of this? Or how do you handicap our macro concerns onto your forward-looking guidance?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
John, I think that at the highest level, we think we're continuing to operate in a relatively weak macro economy as we have been for the last couple of years. So nothing terribly exciting in the economy as a whole. If we kind of look at the comparison we're talking about, recall that a year ago, we were seeing sharp declines occurring in communications infrastructure and we're also seeing some pretty stiff headwinds in the form of foreign exchange where if the rate of exchange moving against us from the US dollar strength standpoint. So despite that, when you take a look at all that, we actually see aside from this one sector of personal electronics, the balance of it's going to be about even on a year-over-year basis.
So again, the headlines that we're seeing on the macro front and a lot of the angst that you mentioned certainly sounds real, but actually from a demand signal standpoint from our customers, it's consistent with what I just said. We continue to operate in a weak macro environment, with lots of cross currents going on. Again, last year's weakening in comms infrastructure, very strong auto, foreign exchange issues that we were dealing with. This year, we don't see where those things are coming into play right now.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, and I'll just add that I think that inside of that weak macro economy, just the diversity of our products and the business model, we continue to operate extremely well inside of that environment. Thank you, John, and we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Chris Danely.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Hey, Chris.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks for letting me ask the follow up. I thought you had something against short people. Just a quick one, so Kevin, as you mentioned, it's kind of a flat environment. You still managed to grow earnings 8% in 2015. So in 2016, if things are flat to down, maybe talk about some of the leverage you guys have or would pull to try and keep earnings flat or could we see earnings be down again? Or excuse me, be down in this year.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, there's a lot of assumptions inside there, Chris. But let me just remind you as to the moving parts that are going on here. And you can spot it if you take a look at the release that we just put out there. I think the most apparent number you can see on there is the decline in depreciation beginning to occur. And clearly, just from an accounting standpoint, that increases our gross profit margin and falls through to EPS. That depreciation will continue its glide path down in 2016, consistent with the fact that a lot of those purchases that we made five years ago are now reaching the end of their depreciable life.
In addition to that, we're seeing a growing portion of our chips being produced in our 300 millimeter capacity and as you know, it costs us about 40% less per chip, or about 20% less per device to manufacture on 300 millimeter versus 200 millimeter. So as that mix improves, that will also fall through to the bottom line.
And then the third element that I'd just point out is that we continue to see a mix shift in the source of revenue into industrial and automotive which tend to have higher overall margins and certainly stickier revenue margin profiles over time. So collectively, those should help our overall margin and earnings performance, notwithstanding whatever direction revenue takes us through over the next 12 months.
In addition to that, from an EPS standpoint, as we have been doing for eleven years now, as long as the intrinsic value of the company is higher than the market value, we will continue to be buyers of TI shares. We reduced our share count 3.4% this past year. And certainly at current prices, it says we should continue to be active accumulators of TI shares. So combined, we certainly would have momentum in our favor, notwithstanding a significant change in our revenue profile to continue to help us with earnings per share.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Right, okay. Thanks so much, Chris. I'm sorry about the difficulty there. And operator, we can go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Kevin, why don't we just continue with the topic you talked about as far as earnings drivers. The OpEx continues to impress. I think for the second year in a row OpEx dropped by 5%. And I know you had some specific closures in Japan, et cetera. If we were to look forward on OpEx, are there any unique drivers, such as closing businesses that are really going to impact that? Or how should we think about OpEx relative to sales?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, Ross, I guess the way I'd answer that is that there are no nobs on the horizon right now of any measure that were similar to what you've seen in the last couple of years. As you pointed out, we had some restructuring actions that we took in Japan, and also in certain parts of Embedded Processing over the last two years, and those have removed quite a bit of OpEx cost. And those are about done now. They pretty much finished up in the middle of last year.
As we look forward, what we would expect to see is what we've talked about in the past, that our OpEx should operate somewhere between 20% and 30% of revenue. In a weak market, it might be pushing 30%. In a reasonably strong markets, it might be pushing 20%. I think we're in the low 20s right now, 23% for 2015. So again as I look forward, I don't see any real material changes to the OpEx profile.
I will just remind you that we do always have a seasonal pattern in our OpEx, just like OpEx was down 3Q to 4Q because of holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, OpEx will be up again in 1Q versus 4Q because of the absence of those holidays, and also the annual pay and benefits increases that we instituted across the company in the first quarter. And just to kind of give you some parameters on that, it's probably in the 4% to 5% range increase, 4Q to 1Q on OpEx.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Any comment on that?
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I do. On the communications equipment side of things, you mentioned it was down about 20%. That's not a huge surprise. You mentioned the wireless cause of that. Can you talk a little bit about what that segment did sequentially in the December quarter and what sort of outlook do you have for it heading into 2016?
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, I think, if you look at that sequentially, it was down around mid teens, but from a year ago, it was down mid teens, but actually did see some growth. That was the second quarter in a row that we had growth inside of there. So I think that business continues to be one that over the last couple of decades has been very, very choppy. That characteristic probable won't change. But we're on a position where we've got a couple of quarters of growth. I think that when we look at it longer term, we do believe that carrier CapEx won't grow. It certainly won't drop to zero either. But we do think that it will get smaller slightly in time. Okay thanks, Ross. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. So last year you expanded gross margins by about 120 basis points, which is very impressive given the flat, the macro environment. But if I had asked you a year ago where would gross margins go given all the levers, right, because it moved from 200 to 300 millimeter, the lower depreciation, the mix shift towards industrial and automotive, do you think you would have thought gross margins would be even stronger than right, what you might have than what you actually achieved? So my question really is that as we look forward, what is a bigger driver of gross margins? Is it top line growth and wafer starts or do you still think that 200 to 300 millimeter, that move is being underappreciated in terms of a gross margin driver?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Okay. First off, let me just make sure we've got the scorekeeping going on correctly here. I think we're talking about 130 basis points of improvement this past year.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Sorry, yes, 130.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Don't want to miss out on that extra 10 there. As I look into 2015, clearly any meaningful revenue growth will incrementally have a much stronger impact than any other piece of the P&L on improving overall gross margins. But independent of margin growth, I'd go back to what I talked about a few minutes ago on Ross's question, and that would be really the increasing mix improvement on 300 millimeter, the mix to industrial and auto and then just the decline in depreciation as we continue to march through 2016. It's pretty tough to handicap which one would be the biggest contributor, or how to sequence those. But I think that they will all collectively be quite meaningful as we move into 2016 and I think we'll probably pleasantly please ourselves again for another year.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, and I'll just add to that, Vivek, that on essentially flat revenues, all of that came down to free cash flow growing by 6%, right. So there's some things going on with accounting rules of on the gross margin line, but really we're focused on growing that gross margin, or on the free cash flow growth specifically and it clocked in pretty nicely as well. So you have a follow on?
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes, thanks Dave. The question is on your Other segment where you have the DLP and calculators and ASICs. So that was down about 14% if I ignore the legacy wireless piece. Why was it down so much and how should we think about that segment in 2016? Thank you.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Sure. And if you look for the year, it was down, I'm not sure if your question was for the year or for the quarter. It's actually the same reason. It's down primarily due to custom ASIC products. If you remember, those products have a very high exposure to wireless infrastructure and that's where we saw the headwind. It was also down because DLP, and DLP had a very good year in 2014, so very, very difficult compare on that front.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Good year because there was a strong World Cup demand pulling through DLP.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And how to think about it for 2016?
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, so I think that if you look, last year was in the mid teens. If you go back several years, it's actually been in that same range. Previous years were primarily driven from the exit of the wireless business. But as we go into next year and as we look, essentially that we've got some long-term growth potentials inside of DLP. I think calculators have been flat to slightly down and we would continue to expect to see that. Growth in royalties, royalties have been about 1% of our revenue and we'd expect them to continue to run in that area. And then we've got ASIC that will shift over time into our Embedded Processing as we pick up that functionality. So we'd expect that mid teens to slow somewhere in the mid to low single digit declines going forward. Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go ahead and move on to the next caller, please.

We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the strength in your Embedded segment in December, you also had a good growth in the September quarter as well. I'm focused on the MCU products here. Can you just help us understand what are the end markets and trends that have been driving the strength here in the MCU biz? I'm assuming most of it was auto and industrial, but love to get your insights.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, so I think when you look at the Embedded sector, if I look for the year, the increase was due to connectivity and microcontrollers. And both of those product lines I would say have a very diverse customer footprint, and so there's really not one sector or market that's driving it. Collectively, you're right. It's in industrial as well as automotive, but probably has a bias to industrial, just because of the diversity of those customers and where they're winning designs. So very, very broad based, and that's part of the reason why we're encouraged with that business and the growth. And I think that also you see how that contributes to the bottom line and the profitability of that sector, or that business for the year.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for that color.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Have a follow-on, Harlan?
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. On your broad catalog analog business, it's a high gross margin business. I think the team has done a good job of continuing to improve the breadth and the access to the portfolio. So I guess the question is did the catalog business outgrow the overall Analog business in 2015 and do you expect it to outperform overall Analog this year as well?
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, so we don't really have our business so much lined up by catalog or not. I'd say that the majority of the products by number certainly are more catalog-based as we've got tens of thousands of products. But we're not quite organized that way. I mean we've got the four businesses of the high volume analog and logic, which will be more application-specific products. And even there, even though they're application-specific, many of those products are available to multiple customers and even sometimes multiple markets, even though they're application-specific. Something like motor drivers, as an example, sell into multiple markets and multiple sectors. We got power and then high performance analog and SVA. So we just don't have a cut between that. Okay, thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to our next caller, please.

We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi, thank you very much. Dave and Kevin, I wanted to go back to the overall environment, and in the past you guys have been very good about giving us essentially sign post metrics. Dave, I think if I remember correctly, rate of cancellations and a few others. Could you please remind us what those metrics are telling you about the overall health of TI's business? And then I had a quick follow up.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Sure. I think, Ambrish, as we just look at our business and as Kevin mentioned before, we believe that we've been operating in a weaker environment and that that will continue from some time. We've had some people ask us if we think a semiconductor cycle is underlying what we're seeing and we just haven't seen those signs of a traditional cycle. So there are things like our lead times continue to remain short. Our cancellations remain very low. Our distribution inventory continues to hold around 4 weeks. And we continue to deliver our products on time to our customers when they're asking at very, very high service levels. So those are some of the bigger ones that come to mind, that you would see some movement if you were moving through a bottom or a top of the cycle, and we just haven't seen that in quite some time.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Great. Makes sense, Dave. And then my follow up was on the industrial segment. And obviously I don't pay attention to the quarter-quarter, but on a full-year basis, if I recall what the number you gave us, it's flat for the year. And the year before that, it was up 10%. So given it's such a cornerstone of your business, also your gross margin expansion, how do you explain the flat year-over-year last year and then what do you think industrial should do in 2016? Thank you, Dave.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Sure, yeah. And before I talk about industrial, I just want to remind those that may not be as familiar with us, when we talk about our industrial market, it's something that's very broad and different than what a typical investor would look from an industrial screen. So we've got 14 sectors that makes up industrial and they'll include things like factory automation, medical and healthcare, building automation, grid infrastructure, test measurement, motor drives, electronic point of sale, space and avionics, display power delivery, appliances, lighting, industrial transportation and then a bucket of everything else that goes into it. So slightly or very different than what most people would think of in industrials.
And you're right, it had a strong year the year before. I think when we started the year, we had expected it to be stronger than what it turned out. And typically a lot of people ask us, hey, we hear the rumors in China. We see the stocks that they follow maybe in the industrial segment are seeing very, very, very weak demand. But we turned in revenue that was consistent with what we saw after a very strong year. And fundamentally what we think's going on inside of that is that there's more semiconductor content going into the industrial market and we think we're in the very early stages of that.
And if you look at the automotive market, I think it's much easier to see that content because we know how many cars ship per year. It's much easier to see the difference between total SAAR unit growth and what the semiconductors are shipping into it. Certainly impossible to be able to see inside of the industrial market because it's very, very broad and very, very diverse. But that said, we believe that we've got a decade or more of runway of increasing content inside of the industrial market. So that's about all the insight I think I can share on that. Okay thank you, Ambrish, and we'll go on to the next caller, please.

We'll go next to Chris Rolland with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Hey guys, thanks for the question and excuse me if this has already been asked. If you could give us a little bit more detail on the Scottish fab and what was being made there and how large was that footprint, and then also, what kind of OpEx opportunities you might have there.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Chris, the fab in Greenock, Scotland, is one that came to us with the acquisition of National Semiconductor in 2011. Most of the parts that are manufactured in there are part of our Silicon Valley Analog business. We announced today that we are going to, I think we're putting together plans to wind down operations there and move the production to other 200 millimeter fabs that we have in Germany, Japan and Maine in the US. These are larger, more cost effective, more technologically advanced factories that can just give us a lot better economics with those chips that are produced there. It will take us about three years to wind down those operations by our estimate right now, as it takes just that much time to requalify those parts into other factories. And at the end of that period, we will no longer have an operation in Greenock. We took a $17 million charge in the quarter as we began planning for that activity and we expect that we'll probably continue to incur roughly $2 million of charges per quarter each quarter through the end of 2018 as we wind it down, for total charges of about $40 million over a three year period.
Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Great, one more follow-up there. Why not any opportunities to move to 300 millimeter? And then also as we look at Embedded, I think we concentrated a little bit on MCUs, but maybe we can talk about connectivity and why that was up year-over-year. And does the growth in MCU year-on-year at all change your penchant in M&A towards Embedded versus your favorite Analog?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Dave and I are going to have to tag team that one. I'll finish off the Scottish fab one, the why not 300 millimeter. Short answer is most of those processes are dual qualed already in other 200 millimeter factories and it's just a whole lot easier to transfer into a qualified process already existing in other factories. Not all, but enough of them. And so consequently, we'll just go ahead and put those into open capacity in 200 millimeter factories versus bringing them into 300. And Dave, you want to take the?
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, Chris, your question on connectivity, what's driving the growth there. There we've got a very broad portfolio of products we support, about a dozen different standards from a connectivity standpoint, so low power Bluetooth to Wi-Fi to other sub-gigahertz standards. And so if somebody wants to connect something, we have a solution that we can offer them. And so we're just seeing really good uptake of the products that we've got there.
I think you rolled in a question about does it change our penchant for acquisition. Again our belief is that when you acquire a company in the Embedded space, you're picking up additional architectures and additional architectures doesn't make you stronger, it just makes you bigger. And so we'll continue to look for companies that have characteristics much like a National does. If we, when we are interested and that's the profile of the type of company.
Let me just add, too, on the Greenock facility that we do expect to save about $35 million once we've completed all the transition. That's on an annualized basis, and once we do complete the transition of the products to the more cost-effective fabs. Okay. Thanks, Chris, and we'll move on to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking the question, and I wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the 300 millimeter points that were made. Kevin, can you help me understand where in the portfolio on a segment and sub-segment basis the company is having the most success with the 300 millimeter transition and therefore, what's left to go? And as you look at the opportunity, is it a fairly steady opportunity or are there some discontinuities hemming in your ability to move product over to 300?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Well, Craig, I'd say the benefit is really happening right now in the Analog portfolio, and it's happened across all four of the business units inside Analog. Because of it, 300 millimeter factor we have in our fab being highly automated, somewhat counterintuitively you don't have to have really high-volume parts running through there, because the automation we can actually run relatively low-volume parts through there and still gain significant cost benefit. So what, the way we've been employing the 300 millimeter strategy is not so much to re-qual existing 200 into that factory, but instead to release new products into that factory on already qualified processes. And that's really the focus that we've had and it will continue going forward. And we'll give a further update as to our progress to date on both the runner (42:57) fab as well as the DMOS6 fab that we're converting that we announced last year, coming on February 9 on our capital management call. So stay tuned for that. We'll give a new update on that as well.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thank you, and then switching gears just on the competitive front. A couple of competitors in the MCU business have recently announced that they'll be getting together. Thoughts on the implications for your ability to continue to grow and take operating margins in Embedded from the mid 20s higher if there's a more consolidated landscape out there. Thank you.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah.
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, go ahead, Dave.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
I was just going to say that we've obviously competed with both of those companies for a couple of decades and them combining together really doesn't change much from a competitive landscape. And we believe that our four competitive attributes that make us unique, they're hard to replicate. We'll stay focused on those and those are our approach to manufacturing, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of the market channels that we've got and our diverse and long-lived positions. And that's what we'll stay focused on those, and we think those have helped us gain share and they'll help us continue to gain share. Okay. We've got time for one more caller, please.

We'll go next to Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee.
Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT
Great, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if I could focus in on the fact that you did report Apple as a 11% customer. Can you maybe talk about your expectations for the full year in terms of content? You did mention you're in many different devices, but on a like for like device there, do you believe that you're holding content, increasing content? Any guidance you can give us and maybe how we should think about that being seasonally, the impacts on that seasonality.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, Doug, we just won't provide color at that level on a specific customer. I just, overall, I think if you look at how Apple has impacted our business with their success in the marketplace, personal electronics was about 30% of revenue in 2015. If you look at the market overall, I think if you take memory out, personal electronics is probably around 60% of the market. And so we have about half of the exposure there. So we try to find places where we've got some differentiation where we believe that those products will last more than one cycle. Perhaps they're products that we developed that we can use in other customers or even in other markets in some cases. So that's really what we'll stay focused on overall. So do you have a follow-on question?
Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT
I do. It's actually probably for Kevin. Looking at, you mentioned depreciation ramping down. Can you give us a sense of how quickly? I've got you running at about a $688 million rate for the year, but your CapEx I believe around $500 million. How quickly should we see those numbers merge together?
Kevin P. March - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Finance & Operations
Yeah, I don't think you're going to see CapEx and depreciation cross over before the end of 2016. Depreciation will continue to run down during 2016. And really the kind of gentle rollover you saw begin to occur in 2015 is your best proxy for how to model 2016.
David Pahl - Vice President and Head of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Doug, and thank you all for joining us. Again, please plan to join us for our capital management call on February 9 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments 3Q 2015 earnings release conference call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectation. We encourage you to review the Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago. While our overall demand remained weak, most areas were stronger than we had expected, especially wireless infrastructure and industrial. In addition, our demand for automotive continued to be strong. I'll elaborate in a few moments. Even in this environment, each of our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing grew year over year. Together, they comprised 85% of third quarter revenue and have delivered nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.76.
With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to the details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model.
In the third quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing-12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 28% of revenue, up from 27% a year ago, and consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. For the trailing-12-month period, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
Analog revenue, which achieved a record level in the quarter, increased 2% from a year ago. The growth was due to high-volume analog and logic. Silicon Valley Analog also grew. Power management was about even, and high-performance analog declined.
Embedded Processing revenue increased by 2% from a year ago due to microcontrollers and connectivity. Processors declined. Our investments in Embedded are translating into tangible results, as this quarter's revenue is also a record.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 19% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products and DLP products. Compared with a year ago, distribution resales increased 6%, and inventory decreased by less than one week to just below four weeks. We believe this inventory level continues to reflect an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. As a reminder, inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because of our consignment program.
Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive remained strong, with all sectors growing and three of the five sectors growing double digits. Industrial revenue was about even, with about half of the 14 sectors growing and about half declining. Personal electronics was up because of demand from one customer. Excluding that one customer, personal electronics was down. Communications equipment was down, driven by wireless infrastructure, which was down about 30% from a year ago. Although weak, it did grow sequentially. And, finally, enterprise systems declined primarily due to DLP projectors.
We continue to focus on making TI stronger through manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what puts TI in a unique class of companies capable of long-term free cash flow growth. Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.00 billion or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 2% due to lower revenue. Operating expenses were a total of $750 million, down $45 million from a year ago, primarily in SG&A. The decline reflects continued cost management across the company, including the previously announced targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan. Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. Operating profit was $1.16 billion or 33.9% of revenue. Operating profit was down 1% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 37.2%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 24.0%, 8 percentage points higher versus a year ago, as we focused our investments on the best growth opportunities. Net income in the third quarter was $798 million or $0.76 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.41 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, down 15 days sequentially. This reduction was the combination of lower factory starts, as well as higher-than-expected revenue in the quarter. As our business model evolves, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. We plan to provide an update on our inventory model to you in our capital management call next February.
Capital expenditures were $139 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in the second quarter, we retired $250 million of debt and issued $500 million of five-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. In August, we retired an additional $750 million of debt. As a result, we have reduced net debt by $500 million this year, which is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This leaves total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%.
On a trailing-12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.11 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing-12-month capital expenditures were $512 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the expansion of our 300-millimeter analog capacity, as discussed in our capital management call earlier this year.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.60 billion or 28% of revenue. Free cash flow was 4% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested into the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt requirements.
In September, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.04 per share, a 12% increase. This was the 12th consecutive year in which we've increased the dividend to our shareholders. We also announced a $7.5 billion increase to our share buyback authorization. In the third quarter, TI paid $348 million in dividends and repurchased $790 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.14 billion. Total cash returned in past 12 months was $4.23 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 41% since the end of 2004. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $2.74 billion of cash and short-term investments, with TI's U.S. entities owning 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.44 billion, up 3% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes about a $35 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus a year ago. We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Acquisition charges, which are noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. They will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%. And this is the tax rate that you should use for the fourth quarter and for the year.
In summary, we believe our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of TI's business model. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations

Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. I guess for the first one, I'm a little curious, when you said demand was weak but the revenue was strong, and then you mentioned that industrial – I think you said, Dave, was even year on year but was stronger than you expected. If you could just give us some more color around the demand environment, because you have such wide exposure, what is better or worse versus three months ago, and what does it really mean that demand is weak but your revenue is strong?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah. Well, what we were saying, Vivek, is that if you look, our revenue declined 2% from a year ago, and we obviously would describe that as a weak demand. That's actually similar to what we saw last quarter. But, inside of that, certainly it was stronger than what we had expected. There were a couple of areas that were stronger than we had expected. Wireless infrastructure and industrial were both stronger than what we had expected. So that's really what we're trying to say. We continue to operate in what we would consider to be just a weaker macroeconomic environment, and that's where we came in.
Do you have a follow-up?
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yeah, thanks, Dave. On gross margin, I understand that sequentially they were sort of flattish, because I assume you took some utilization down. But why are they sort of flat to down versus last year? Because I assume throughout this year, there's been a mix shift towards your core Analog/Embedded markets and a mix shift I guess towards more 300-millimeter capacity. So why aren't gross margins up versus last year?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Vivek, the short answer is that our wafer starts were down in the quarter versus last quarter and also versus last year, and so underutilization was a little bit higher than it was a year ago.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. Great. Thank you, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong result. Kevin, just to follow-up on that gross margin comment. So utilization went down in the third quarter. I know you're saying you're going to update us on your inventory targets, but I think the one that's outstanding right now is about $105 million to $115 million, and you got there pretty quickly sequentially. So I'm kind of curious, how do I think about utilization going into the December quarter, and what kind of impact should I expect on the gross margin line?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, John, as we look into the fourth quarter, we're expecting our wafer starts will probably be roughly flat to what they were this quarter, so no significant change in starts there. And keep in mind that the wafers that we start in fourth quarter, other than for the first few weeks of the quarter, are mostly for what we expect in follow-on quarters. So we build quite a bit forward to our expectation of when that inventory actually gets sold.

That's helpful. And then, Kevin, as my follow-up, you guys probably were one of the first to start the trend of M&A with the acquisition of National several years back. There's been a lot of speculation in the marketplace about more M&A within the semi space. I know you've talked about this in the past, but I'd kind of be curious about kind of getting some updated thoughts from your perspective about the advantage from here given your already-hefty scale of M&A and how you guys are sort of thinking about that?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, John. So I guess it'll take me a second to kind of go through those thoughts there. Of course we acquired National back into 2011, so we probably got ahead of the game versus where people are at today. But we spent the intervening time period really driving hard to accelerate four attributes that we think in combination are pretty unique to TI and differentiate us quite a bit from our competitors, which may, in fact, be impacting some of their thinking about how they approach their markets. And those four attributes are our approach to low-cost manufacturing and advanced technology; the sheer breadth of our overall product portfolio; the reach we have to our customers through our market channels, especially with arguably the largest sales force of anybody out there; and the diversity and long-lived positions that we enjoy in the markets with the products that we have.
When we look at what most companies are doing today from an M&A front, it appears that some of them may be changing their focus, and some of them may be trying to build scale. We already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage, and we believe we're focused on the two best opportunities that are out there today, being Analog and Embedded Processing. So those two reasons aren't motivating us to think differently about M&A.
When we do think about M&A, our approach is really to focus on the right strategic fit, one that can generate long-term returns and excess free cash flows. So we really do focus on the numbers that that acquisition might lead us to. And by strategic fit, I'm talking really our bias is towards Analog. If we were to look at an acquisition, it would probably be a company that's going to be broad in catalog, have a diverse customer base, have a large percentage of its revenue coming from industrial and automotive, probably have a very talented R&D team. Those would be the sort of attributes we'd look at from a strategic standpoint.
From a return standpoint, we'd look at several metrics, including really making sure that the return on our investment is accretive to our weighted average cost of capital within, say, four years or so. And we also want to make sure that whatever we acquire can continue to expand our cash flow.
So, with all that said, and we take a look at what's out there, we have been actually buying our favorite semiconductor company – I know you don't like to hear it that way – but through our own stock buybacks. Today, by buying back those shares, we're getting a 7% free cash flow yield on those acquisitions of those shares, and we don't have any integration risk and no banker fees. And just a whole lot easier way to run the business and focus on customers.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with the Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, I'd like to follow up on the industrial market. You said half of your markets were kind of up year over year; half of them were down. That's pretty similar to – the same as last quarter, but you do seem to be seeing upside versus expectations. Within industrial, can you give us some idea of which end markets you're actually seeing relative strength versus weakness versus those expectations? And talk a little bit about how your end markets within industrial are concentrated or not.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, so great question, Stacy. We've got 14 different sectors that make up our industrial market. And I'll just go through some of those, because I think some investors, if they focus on industrials – we mean something different than that. So it includes things like factory automation and control, medical and healthcare, building automation, smart grid and energy, test and measurement, motor drives, display, space avionics, appliance, power delivery systems, point-of-sale lighting, industrial transportation. And then a bucket of just other really small stuff.
So last year, as you know, Stacy, industrial was 31% of our revenues. The largest sector inside of there was 4%. So you can see it gets very, very diverse very quickly. And even inside of each of those sectors we've got multiple end equipments that make each of those up. So it was very similar to last quarter, where we did see about half of the sectors up and the other sectors down, together flat. So there weren't really any really huge movements in either that we would call out to say that it was unusual. So that's what it looked like.
Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
I do. Thank you. Around your OpEx, it seems like you came in fairly light in the quarter versus expectations. Why was that, and where do you see OpEx going next quarter?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
So, Stacy, on OpEx – if you compare it to a year-ago-quarter, that was really when we just had continued cost management going on across the company, and we also had the benefit on a year-ago comparison to the actions that we previously announced in Embedded Processing and Japan. And those are now done. So we get that benefit year over year. As it relates to sequential, even, as you say, coming into the quarter a little bit better than expected, that's really just cost management continuing. And also in second quarter there were a few items that didn't recur in second and third quarter, and so that gave us a good little benefit second to third.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Stacy. And we'll go to our next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In Q2, Embedded was up year over year for the first time. Actually, no, Q2 Embedded was down year over year for the first time, I think, versus the prior 10 quarters. It inflected higher in Q3. I know you guys said MCU and connectivity drove the growth, but what end markets helped to return this business back to year-over-year growth? And also what drove the 450 basis point improvement in operating margins?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. So I guess two questions there. I'll take the first one. So, as you said, Embedded Processing was driven by microcontrollers and connectivity, and both of those businesses tend to be very broad market exposures, a high exposure to industrial. We also have some exposure inside of processors to automotive. And what drove the weakness in second quarter and the reason why processors declined year over year was the exposure to wireless infrastructure, is probably the simplest way to say that.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
On operating margin, Harlan, the short answer is we had announced at the end of 2012 some restructuring actions inside Embedded Processing that would wind up last year, and in fact they have. So a lot of that cost is out, and so as a result their operating margins are coming through very nicely.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, yeah. Nice job on -
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
And we'll let you squeeze in a third question, but we'll make an exception for you on this one.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I appreciate that. Last quarter you guys indicated you were bringing down utilizations in the third quarter to try and reduce inventories. Looks like you guys executed to that. Should we anticipate gross margins in Q4 down in line with the lower utilizations in Q3?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Harlan, I'm not going to try to forecast individual lines of the P&L, but I'll just bring you back to what I had mentioned when John asked his question. We expect utilization to decline – pardon me, utilization to be about – excuse me, starts to be about even in fourth quarter versus third quarter, so we don't expect starts to actually change. The starts were already down third quarter versus second and third quarter versus a year-ago quarter, and we'll maintain those starts about even going into fourth quarter.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah, and the other – certainly the other consideration with fourth quarter is what happens to revenue overall. So we'll have less revenue, so that'll impact gross margins. Okay. Thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thanks, guys. So if we look at just some sort of normal or reasonable projections for Q4, for 2015 your revenue's going be flat but your gross margins will be up and your OpEx will be down. If we assume the sort of bleah environment continues into 2016 and revenue is sort of whatever, around the flattish or something like that, is there any way that gross margins could go up and OpEx go down again? Can you just kind of take us through the puts and pulls for next year on those?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, I'll go ahead and take you through on those sort of things, Chris. First off, I'm hoping that you're wrong in your theory about revenue being flat again next year.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Me, too. I want to keep my job.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
But under that scenario, I doubt that we'd see a whole lot of change in operating expenditures other than just normal annual pay and benefit increases. But on the margin side, on the gross margin side, we'd probably continue to see benefit as we see more and more of our production moving to 300 millimeter, which as you recall gives us about a 40% chip cost production from an overall cost of goods standpoint, so that will certainly benefit our gross margin line. In addition to that, we continue to see an expansion of revenue that's coming out of the industrial and automotive space as a percent of the total, and those tend to come through at higher gross margins, as well as just overall catalog products versus custom products inside our mix.
And then the last item is that, as we talked about for a couple years now, our CapEx has been running under our depreciation by a couple of points, and that is slowly beginning to close. In fact, you can even see that gap closing just in this past 12-month comparison period. So as we look out into 2016, you'll see that gap close a bit more. So those in combination will give us continued tailwind on the gross margin line. Should fall all the way through to the operating margin.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, and I'd just add, too, that even with this year, if the revenue projections come in as you said, Chris, that our free cash flow margin continued to expand, and that's really what we're focused on.
Do you have a follow-up, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yeah. So if we look at what revenue did sequentially in Q3 and what you're projecting for in Q4, it's pretty even with last year. So – and it sounds like even though business is still kind of bleah, it's getting a little bit better. Would you characterize the environment overall as kind of normal? And if it's not normal, then where would be your biggest area of concern or weakness?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, Chris, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it would suggest that our revenues would be down 2% from the year-ago. That's similar to the number that we just turned in, as well as what we saw in second quarter. So we just described the environment really hasn't changed very much. We just believe that we're operating in a weak macro environment. And we continue to focus on execution, and I think the business is showing the results of that focus and the strength of the business model. But, in general, that's really what we believe that we're operating in.
So, okay. Thanks, Chris. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you had a 10% customer in the quarter or if you had any meaningful change in revenue from a single customer that would have affected the overall trend in the business during the quarter?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, Will, when we had – if we look at last year, we had – our largest customer was 8% of revenue. And we don't give customer size by quarter, but we expect that that customer, as they've done well this year, that they could come in around 10% of our revenue. And I'd say this: As we look at that customer, we sell them hundreds of devices across multiple products. And if I contrasted that to the last time that we had a customer that was more than 10%, most of that revenue was concentrated in just a few parts and a single application. And even more specifically than that, it was really one function that maybe was that different generation. So we really just had one function at that customer. So even inside of this customer we've got quite a bit of diversity.
Do you have a follow-on, Will?
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Yeah, it's sort of related to this. The company exited the wireless apps processor and baseband business a few years ago. And I suppose the answer is around the concentration at the part number level, but does what looks like a growing exposure to the handset market through at least one but probably multiple customers – does that concern the company, the way that – in a similar way that caused you to exit some products previously?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Will, I'd say that when you heard Dave's opening remarks that we saw growth in personal electronics and without that one customer growing, personal electronics would've been down, I think that's also telling us that as handsets overall grow, they're really becoming the larger piece of the personal electronics space. And so what's important is to have a lot of different chips that you're selling into, a lot of different customers who sell into that space, and that's exactly what we have.
And so from that standpoint, if we're going to participate in personal electronics, you're going to be a – participating in handsets, and there are a lot of very attractive chip opportunities inside handsets, unlike what we had a number of years ago, as you remembered, with baseband and processors, where those parts were basically standardizing and commoditizing, and your ability to differentiate was diminished and therefore your ability to attract profits from selling those parts was diminished. And so consequently, I see this as quite a bit different today given the diversity of products that we're talking about here than the example of when we were baseband and processors five-plus years ago.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, and I'd add to that, if you look across personal electronics and you add smartphones and tablets and PCs and TVs and things like that, you're probably – if you added all those together, you're probably scaring (30:15) 2.4 billion, 2.5 billion units. And even though that unit pool probably isn't going to grow much, there's – as Kevin said, there's opportunities to find products that will live through multiple generations that you can sell to multiple customers and places where we'll continue to try to steer our investments overall.
So thank you, Will, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Really two related questions. One, I just – a clarification. You said the upside in the quarter came from wireless infrastructure and industrial. It seems like HVAL was up a lot. Was that part of what you're calling industrial? And then maybe bigger picture, from a geographic perspective, there's obviously been some negative data points in kind of the U.S. industrial market. Just any change – over the summer it was China, now you're seeing some U.S. issues. Just any perspective from a geographic basis. Thanks.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. So let me answer your first question, which if you look at HVAL, HVAL will have a high exposure to automotive, which will help drive those revenues. It'll also have exposure to personal electronics as well. It does have some industrial exposure, but I think that those are the areas that will drive that revenue. And you had a follow-up?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
The question was just what you're seeing from a geographic perspective. Obviously China was weak – yeah.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, so – yeah, if I just look at our regional results year over year, revenue was down in Asia, in Europe, and U.S. In Japan, it was up. If you look at the broader China market, it really wasn't down differently than what the broader Asia was, and that was kind of down consistent with our overall revenue. So really didn't see much different.
The second thing I'll add is that, a lot of times we're asked by investors what our exposure to China is or to a particular market, and in our 10-K we give a very precise number of what we ship into, China being 44%. But we always like to point out that if you're looking for what exposure to a particular market is, I think most investors are asking how much of our product is actually consumed there. And so it's a very different number than 44%. It's much lower than that, because obviously some of those products that we ship there end up getting shipped into other regions.
I'll also point out that we may ship product into a Tier 2 OEM that gets put into a European automobile in Europe and then shipped into China. So you can't really look at any of our regional results and understand that. So – but overall, probably a good proxy to begin to start an analysis would be to look at what China is as a percentage of GDP, and kind of start an analysis from there.
So, okay. Thank you, Blayne, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your customer inventories. You gave us the very helpful disti resale and inventory numbers, but just in general, you had a pretty good year in 2014, a weaker year this year, but my perception is that the customer inventory management, lead time, days held hasn't really changed. Can you just talk about whether you've seen any inflection there in the last few quarters?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Sure, Joe. I'd say that of course the distribution inventories, as you said, that we can see very well, we've got 55% of our revenues that are on consignment. So for those portions, which will include 60% of our distributor revenue, but we know for that portion of our revenue there is no inventory, so it's actually zero. So obviously that's in really good shape. And if you look overall, the classic kind of booked/shipped carrying inventory type portion of our revenue is really about 20% of our revenue. And that's where we'll carry backlog, customers will have inventory. So we really don't see any signs that customer inventories are significantly out of whack. I'm sure you can always find pockets here and there. But we believe that they're fairly lean with very few exceptions, such as the wireless infrastructure.
So do you have any follow-ons, Joe?
Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, and I did want to follow up on wireless infrastructure. You said it was up sequentially, recovering from a lower level. Do you have visibility into whether that's sort of China deployments or Western deployments? And what do you see as the trajectory for that business going forward?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, so, Joe, we have – I'd say that our exposure in wireless infrastructure, if you look at the major OEMs that make up the majority of that market, we'll have a different product exposure, but a fairly consistent exposure across them. So if there's demand in any of the regions, we'll typically participate in that. If you look at by technology – that's oftentimes another cut that people will look at – we've got a strong position in 3G, a slightly stronger position in 4G. And even in newer areas that we expect growth in the future that we've been investing in, as an example like small cells, we've been investing and believe we'll have a very strong position there as well. So our numbers aren't so much impacted by a specific region. Of course, we won't escape it either if there's weakness in any particular region.
So, okay. Thank you, Joe. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong results. I know in the past, Dave, you gave the year-over-years. I think you mentioned that the wireless infrastructure sequentially was up. I was hoping you could give the sequential direction by the other markets, and I think from the math you gave earlier, for last year, by the end markets, it seemed to imply that the combination of industrial and your comm infrastructure, your wireless infrastructure, must have been up the better part of 15% sequentially. So if you could just comment on the directional color by segment and if those magnitudes are anywhere close, that would be helpful.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Okay. Yeah, so I can share with you some color sequentially. The automotive market grew sequentially, led by our ADAS and infotainment sectors. Industrial, again, was about even. And personal electronics was up, with growth in most of the sectors that make up that market. Communications equipment was, up as we talked about earlier, due to wireless infrastructure. And enterprise systems was about even. So – and, as we talked about, most of those areas were stronger than we had expected, but specifically wireless infrastructure and industrial.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, just on the year-over-year growth, though, I'm not sure, Ross, on the numbers you were reciting there, but industrial overall year over year was probably only up about 1%. And then wireless -
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I was talking sequentially.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Okay. Yeah, because wireless infrastructure is still down year over year. Sequential industrial was actually down about 1% overall. And then wireless infrastructure was, again, up in single digits. So really not much growth there.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah. Okay. And do you have a follow-up, Ross?
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, just a quick one, more housekeeping. I know you're not going to give exact guidance on the gross margin you said earlier, but as far as OpEx directionally in the fourth quarter and first quarter, I know you guys tend to have some year-end phenomenons that impact that. So, Kevin, any sort of color on those two quarters would be helpful. Thanks.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Ross, it's going to be pretty normal to what you've seen in past quarters. Your memory is quite correct on that. 4Q is typically down low to mid-single digits percentage-wise, just because of seasonality of holidays around Thanksgiving and Christmas. And then first quarter is typically up in a reverse direction. Again, because of the absence of holidays and also because of the implementation of our annual pay and benefits increases. So I think that if you look at the past couple of years, 3Q to 4Q to 1Q, that's probably the best proxy for you to try to model into your spreadsheets for now.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, okay. Thank you, Ross. And we can go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Erik Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yeah, thanks. This is Erik calling in for Tore. A lot of questions have been asked, but going back to the 300-millimeter strategy, can you give us an update on that exiting the year, maybe how much of Analog would you expect to be coming out of the fabs to support that?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Hey, Erik. I'll just say that we'll give an update to that in our February capital management call. I can just say that part of our plan was to qualify our DMOS6 factory, so that qualification is planned to be done before the end of the year. And so we're still tracking to that. And we've been releasing products to RFAB, or the Richardson fab, for some time, so we're going to continue to do that. And we still have quite a bit of capacity to be able to grow into.
So do you have a follow-on?
Erik Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yeah, no, thank you. That's helpful. The Embedded Processing, obviously the operating margins looked very good this quarter. Going forward – and I know you probably don't want to give too much guidance on this – but what are the expectations for this business? Will it be lumpy in terms of the improvements? Was this a little bit more of an outsized quarter in terms of the improvement, or should we see – what are some of the expectations for that group?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Erik, I'll just tell you, that team's been working pretty hard for a number of years now to grow their revenue. We've talked about their mission over the last couple of years has really been cost containment and growing the revenue, and they are achieving very good results on that now. Importantly, they're a strong contributor to our free cash flow growth. And just as our free cash flow at the company level tends to be weaker in the first couple quarters and stronger in the second couple of quarters, I don't think it's any different than when we take a look at how some of the business units underneath will perform on that metric, being as they're the ones contributing to that free cash flow.
We tend to look at these things over a longer period of times, because quarter to quarter can be pretty noisy. But I think that team has done a very good job of getting its margins up to where we think its entitlement is at, and they should be performing at that level for the foreseeable future – in fact the long term is what we expect out of them.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah. And I'll just add that, as Kevin mentioned, the growth has been coming through from the investments that we've made. We highlighted that they, as well as Analog, had achieved record levels of revenue as a result of those investments. Together Analog and Embedded have grown for nine quarters in a row year over year. So – and I think there was one quarter where Embedded actually did well but didn't grow year over year, and that was last quarter that had the big headwind from wireless infrastructure. But the other parts of that business obviously did very well.
Okay. I think we have time for one last caller. Operator?

And we'll take our last question from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. Just a detail of your earlier answer. You noted personal electronics was up because of demand from one customer. What about your broader segments? Would you still have seen year-over-year growth in both Analog and Embedded if it hadn't been for that same one customer?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, I actually don't have that data broken out between the two segments, but I think that personal electronics is mostly inside of Analog. And so our personal electronics business without that customer obviously wasn't up. So that would have impacted Analog.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Well, let me remind you the other side of that, too, in that we had a significant change in foreign exchange rates at the beginning of (44:03) the year. And so actually in the third quarter, and I think again in the fourth quarter, we saw and expected about a $35 million negative top line impact due to foreign exchange rates. So we can always pick out individual pieces. The beauty of the TI model is that we have tens of thousands of customers buying tens of thousands of parts into almost every electrical and electronic market that's out there, and the diversity is what is really paying off for shareholders in free cash flow generation.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
That's good -
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thanks very much.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
And I guess you don't have follow-up, David?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, actually one quick one. As you move more to 300 millimeters, are you vacating any specific 200-millimeter facilities you might be able to close down or sell eventually?
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations
Yeah, David, we've put in place that 300-millimeter capacity in the Richardson fab and put together the plans inside of DMOS6, the second 300-millimeter factory, to be able to support growth. That's why that's there. It's really releasing new products into those factories. And that's what they're there for, and that'll help us maximize free cash flow.
Dave Pahl - Vice Present & Head of Investor Relations

2015-09-18,Q&A," Session
Q - Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And, Dave, talk a little bit about the announcements that you just made today. I believe there was a Board meeting and some of the cash return metrics just got updated, not the targets but what you're actually approved to do. So, talk about the dividend and the buyback.
Dave Pahl
Sure. Yes. So -- thanks first of all for having us, Ross. We appreciate it.
We just recently announced that we've both increased our divided, as well as authorized an additional $7.5 billion for share repurchases. We've had a consistent increased dividend, as you've seen us do, over the past 12 years. And on the buyback standpoint, the $7.5 billion is a figure that we've done in the past. We've done between 7-1/2, one other time we did 7-1/2, we've done $5 billion as well, and really is just reloading on the authorization. So, no change in our commitment to return 100% of our free cash flow to investors. You've seen us do that through dividends as well as the steady repurchases of shares.
I'll just maybe point out that our share count has been reduced through those repurchases since the beginning of 2005 by 40%.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So if you put this together, I think that it's going to get you just over, what, about 3% dividend yield at the current rate?
Dave Pahl
I think that's about right.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Somewhere in that range.
How do you guys judge the balance between those two, between the dividend and the share repurchase? You do great on both of them obviously, but how do you prioritize one versus the other?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, how we think about that is we take the previous four years' free cash flow, we take half of that number and use that as the target for the dividend increase. What that has translated to is about 40% to 45% of our free cash flow going to dividend and about 60%. So if you're in an environment where you're continuously increasing free cash flow, you'll be a little bit ahead of that 50% mark.
So we think that that offers flexibility for us to have a dividend increase if we entered into a period of prolonged economic weakness, we could still have the judgment ability to still increase the dividend even in that environment.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Is the 12% increase [inaudible] so I haven't been able to check it, versus prior increases, how was the 12% chosen?
Dave Pahl
It was chosen -- with that framework, yeah.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Okay.
Dave Pahl
Going forward. So you can see, if you run the numbers, it's not an absolute number, it's a starting point for us to have that gauge, but it's real close to that road to get us there.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And what's the - again, the capital allocation, not only cash return to shareholders but also the balance sheet and the amount of leverage that you want to be able to have on the balance sheet -- I know in the past you've talked about the importance of having a pristine credit rating. Talk a little bit about how much leverage TI likes to have on the balance sheet.
Dave Pahl
Well, when we acquired National, we did that primarily -- we did some cash on that deal, but we had -- I think we started with about $6.5 billion of debt, if my memory serves me correctly. And we've been slowly paying that down over time, and obviously our ability to borrow has increased, so we've got some amount of spread between those two numbers.
I think when we acquired National, our belief was we were going to pay that debt back kind of on the schedule as we had set up the debt. But as low interest rates had persisted, we really came to the conclusion and got comfortable with debt being on the balance sheet permanently as long as it makes economic sense.
So what you've seen us do, like this year as an example, we have paid off -- we'll end up paying off about $0.5 billion of debt, and then rolling the balance of the debt forward [inaudible] time [ph]. So that's basically how we're thinking about it.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And I know it's a moving target depending upon the health of other aspects of the Company, but what sort of debt load do you think you could carry and still have the highest credit rating, which I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, is a priority to maintain that?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. It's a priority to maintain it. If we had something significant happen where we felt like we needed to take up more debt, we would do that. We do it very, very thoughtfully and very carefully. But all things being equal, we don't have plans or want to change that.
And that's part of the reason why you see us slowly working down that debt over time. Again we're comfortable having it, but, you know, we just like to open up that capacity over time; that gives us more strategic options at some point in the future.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
To the extent it's possible or -- possible to answer, willing to answer, $4 billion roughly is what you have in I believe gross debt right now?
Dave Pahl
Three, yeah, a little --
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
A little under four. Right. What amount do you think, you know, could you triple that size, double that size, that would still keep you in the target range?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Not a number we'd want to give out, but again we've had I think 6-1/2 on the balance sheet at one point, so.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Right.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. It's a number higher than that today.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Right. So why don't we just stick with the whole cash allocation side of the equation? What's your opinion on the M&A that's going on in the space? It hasn't -- well, I guess it depends somewhat how you define the analog market, but it hasn't hit the big four analog players yet. You were probably the last one to do a big analog deal with National Semi. Talk a little bit about TI's approach to M&A and the potential involvement going forward?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. So our approach really hasn't changed. And, you know, we basically have two lenses that we would look at any potential acquisition, with the first is a strategic one. And there we would look for an analog company and we'd want to find a company that has a very diverse set of customers, diverse set of products, and products that are finding long-lived positions in the marketplace, products that are differentiated, a.k.a. they have good margins, and having a company that's continuing to put out those high-quality products. So you don't want to buy something that, you know, was good ten years ago and still not producing good-quality parts today.
And if you think of National, they're probably a great test keys for that, right? You can go through the check list there and check off each of those as you walk through. So that's, you know, some of the things that we look for from a strategic standpoint.
If you look from a financial standpoint, we'll look at a lot of different financial metrics. You know, a couple of them that would come to the top would be, can we achieve our cost-to-capital in a three to four-year time period? You know, how does that investment look versus buying back our own shares? And what's the free cash flow return off of that investment?
I think with our stock price, I didn't do the math today, but I think we're above 7% free cash flow yield. There was a point not too far long ago that we're just about 8% on that target.
So, those are some of the things that we'll look at. Nothing is ever absolute on each of those metrics, but those are the things that go into consideration.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And I know you've said this in the past so this is nothing new, make sure to clarify that upfront, but why prioritize analog over embedded? You know, embedded is another strategic focus area for the Company, but you've repeatedly said, I think even last year up here Kevin said that analog is the priority, not embedded.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Why one versus the other?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. It really comes down to that those businesses, they're both good-quality businesses, as you talked about, but they make their money very differently. And what I mean by that is, is that if you have a very unique analog product and you get 10 customers or 100 customers that value that uniqueness, they could buy that product for, you know, five years, 10 years, 20 years, and there's economic benefit for that uniqueness.
In embedded, having a unique architecture or having a bunch of architectures doesn't help you running a really good embedded business. You want to have as few of architectures as possible, as many customers, and as much revenue over those. So, just buying other companies and sticking together more architectures, bigger is not better in that case.
So we've got lots of examples or several examples of companies that were stuck together that have lots of architectures that, you know, the number one supplier, as an example, there's lots of architectures that they struggle financially, so.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So the scalability is much better in the analog side is what it comes down to, on the architectures.
One other aspect of the strategic focus that I would think would come in when looking at deals if you guys have a very large fab footprint.
Dave Pahl
Yup.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
You've been opportunistic in adding to that, the leader with 300 millimeter capacity, etcetera. Does it go into the equation of somebody who could help fill those fabs? You're not just going for scale for volume's sake along, but all else being equal, if somebody is using a bunch of 300 millimeter wafers at X, Y, Z foundry, I would think it'd be all the better to build them internally?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So the simple answer is no. But let me back up and explain why. Let me start with, you know, we've put in place over the last few years an $8 billion 300-millimeter plant. And so last year we built about $2 billion of analog product on 300 millimeter. And the reason why we like 300 millimeters, it gives us a 40% cost advantage when we do that. So we gave an example of how that runs through the P&L, and the silicon costs at 40% less, it's about half of the cost of the total product. So, in that example that we gave, for a product that we sold for a dollar and was at 60% margin, that same product built on 300-millimeter gives us 68% gross profit. So, economically there's a lot of reasons why you'd want to do it.
The reason why the answer is no is that, if you think of the types of companies that we'd be interested and ones that fit that criteria, they by nature have a very diverse customer base. And just trying to move each of the products over to that just takes too long to involve. That isn't the reason to do the acquisition.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And that's some of the reason, I would assume, that you haven't closed any of the fabs came with -- came with National.
Dave Pahl
That's correct.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Same sort of -- it's easier to redesign things going forward at most than it is to port them over.
Dave Pahl
That's right. Yeah. And we've moved some of the process technologies from National into our factories, so they've released new products. And then our engineers and their engineers -- their engineers have access to our other technologies which they've used, and some of our product groups have used some of their older technologies as well. So we get a benefit in both directions.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So, since we talked about the 300-millimeter side a little bit, talk about the end-markets that that's most applicable to. Some of the clarification on that math with the gross margin is, you know, it's 40% cost savings, but the dye itself is only half of the cost, and so that kind of gets you to the 20% benefit that you're talking about. That sort of cost-centric area I would think would be best-suited to higher volume end-markets, but -- so, talk about the end-markets that best fit what you're doing in 300-millimeter.
Dave Pahl
Yeah, there -- you know, if you build anything with 40% lower cost, then that market goes to a 40% lower cost. So it really benefits any of the markets that will serve. And in fact, all four of our business units have products running inside of Richardson today. And there's a belief that, jeez, yeah, you've built so many products in each 300-millimeter lot that there's only a few products that would make sense to go there. But in fact we can actually build split lots where we'll have in a 24-wafer manufacturing lot, theoretically we could have 24 different products running there. Practically we don't do that, but you could, you know, run one wafer and 23 of another type inside of a manufacturing lot. And we can do that because 300-millimeter manufacturing equipment is fully automated. The wafers are not touched once they enter the building, until they go out the other end. Everything is done, you know, through machines handling it and moving it around the fab. So that's why you can build that type of efficiency. You don't see that same type of efficiency in a 200-millimeter fab.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Maybe the last question on the fab footprint, is, some of the competitors, actually I think two out of the three largest competitors are doing increasing amounts of foundry usage, instead of adding their own fabs, or even in some cases they're shutting down fabs, talk a little bit about what you think the trade-off is, where TI is willing to have its own fab footprints, where others are going to foundries, what's the sort of advantage or trade-off you see in making those strategic decisions.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. So, you know, when we look at our strategy of acquiring assets at very low prices and putting in place that capacity, we're able to put that -- we've got $6 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity to grow into, and we're able to grow into it and keep our CapEx at 4% of sales. And that gives us control of our manufacturing process. It allows us to continue to invest and differentiate and process technologies.
If you're moving to a fab, and let's say that you develop a process technology and you're going to run more wafers a year, that's something that's not attractive from a foundry standpoint, but we've got that flexibility to be able to do things like that. And maybe linking back even to your last question, we may have some products, you know, we can shoot down a 90-nanometer on some of the equipment that we've got inside of our fab. Well, you may have products that run at 250, 300-nanometer. So when you're running on that equipment, you can get tighter tolerances and differentiate your products on some of them by running it there.
So we've got a lot of advantages to doing it, and again those assets are going to be -- have useful lives of a decade or 20 or 30 years in some cases. So the return on that investment will be very high. And when you're locked into a foundry for 10,000 products across 70,000 customers, you really, just like the reason why we wouldn't want to move those products, it's really difficult to move them out of those fabs. And you think 10 and 15 years from now, who will have more pricing power between the owner of the fab or the people putting purse on it. Those types of things compel us to want to continue to own our own fabs.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And again, if any investors have any -- or anybody in the audience have any questions, just raise your hand, we'll get the mic over to you.
Why don't we shift over a little to the end-market side of things? You guys break out things most precisely between analog, embedded and other. But if we went into the end-market way of looking at it, talk a little bit about the growth drivers within the industrial and automotive markets. Those are the two you highlighted as growing fast, as being focal points for the Company going forward. Maybe starting in the industrial side, what are some of the drivers that you see? And how much of that is going to be GDP-dependent, you can do everything you want to do, but [inaudible] up here, and said, yeah, that's still going to be, if GDP is bad, it's going to be hard to grow that segment.
Dave Pahl
Right. Yes. So, you know, I think in industrial, we -- it's pretty obvious, if you just looked around and see where semiconductors are showing up today, that weren't there just a few years ago, and I was reminded on my trip here today, Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, they just redid a parking structure, and you've probably seen this before where you pull in and it'll tell you, you know, by floor how many parking spots they've got available. You pull up to a road and you can look down and there's a light above it that's either green if it's available or red if it's not. And all of that information gets aggregated together. So I don't know if there's $5 of content per parking spot or $25 per spot, but five years ago it was zero.
So I think the general theme is that things are getting smarter and more connected, that's driving growth.
You know, another example that have -- I know, Ross, I've told you, my daughter's a new nurse and she works at Children's Hospital. And if you've ever been in a hospital and you've seen that Pulse Ox that goes on your finger and kind of pinches a little bit and a little uncomfortable, now imagine that on a six-month old child, they don't like that a lot, right? So we've got some new technology that's coming out that's wireless, that's a patch that they can put on the child, and it'll wirelessly communicate that. So I think there's more content in that patch than there is on a mechanic thing that snaps on your finger.
So it's hard to say it's one thing. That's the beauty of that market. It's not just one thing. It's not just one type of application where you can come up with a new architecture. It's not one connectivity standard. It's not one sensor that goes into that. So we're positioned really well to service those types of markets.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
And on the automotive side, you know, there's all the buzz words of ADAS and fully automated driving, etcetera.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Walk in a showroom, you get excited, right? It's amazing the amount of content that's going in. And last year, automotive was 13% of our revenues, I should say industrials 31%.
The other comment I'd make, just going back to industrial, we've got a little over a dozen sectors that make up industrial, and the largest of which is about 4% of our revenue. So you can tell it's very, very broad-based from that standpoint.
Inside of automotive, we've got five sectors that make up the market for us. The largest is infotainment and cluster displays, next is ADAS or Advanced Driver Assist Systems, then powertrain, which includes electric vehicles and hybrids. After that is safety. And then something we called Body. So, think of signal lights, in-cabin lighting, touch-sensitive buttons to put the windows up and down, and those types of things.
So when we look at growth, year over year automotive for us grew double digits. Those five sectors, all of them grew double digits with the exception of one. And that one grew just rounded down to nine. So, very broad-based growth and we just -- every semiconductor company is seeing opportunity there, but -- and we're translating it into revenue.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Everybody is seeing the growth, as you just said, and it's all content is the answer.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
But investors simultaneously get concerned about it if, you know, fewer high-end cars are being sold into China, what's going to happen to the semiconductor guys that are serving the automotive market. How do you balance the unit side versus the content side?
Dave Pahl
We don't spend a lot of time worried about it. Quite frankly, we just believe that we look five and ten years from now, there's going to be more semiconductors and automotive. Does that mean that that line is going to be straight and up to right every quarter? No, it won't be.
And if I go to a market that has probably worse choppiness [ph], like comms infrastructure, that's down, but it's going to carrier CapEx, it hasn't been down as dramatically as what we've seen revenue there. It'll come back. So that's why we really don't worry about those types of things in the near term and really look longer term at it.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Since you mentioned the comm infrastructure side, remind people what percentage of sales roughly -- or maybe what it was a year ago and what it is now, that, unfortunately the number is --
Dave Pahl
It's much smaller.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Yes.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. So, comms equipment is 16% of our revenue. That area that's getting all the attention is wireless infrastructure was 10% of our revenue. And wireless infrastructure is what's down --
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So, 10 out of the 16 points.
Dave Pahl
Ten of the 16, yeah. Ten percent of TI revenues --
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Correct.
Dave Pahl
-- is comms infrastructure. And that's down 15%.
It's a good business. We ship both analog and embedded and custom ASIC into that business. We make good money and carrier CapEx has been down 15% from a year ago. So that demand will return. We haven't tried to be public on when we think it'll return. Most of that revenue tends to be on consignment, so we've got very good visibility. But even with that visibility, it can change quickly. So, you know, we do know that it will return and we'll be prepared for it when it does.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Knowing full well that it's only 10% of your business and maybe if you can round up [inaudible] line of sight [ph], 16%, I'll ask the question anyway. On the wireless side, so we feel excited about 4G base stations, LTE rollouts, etcetera, etcetera. It seems like we never got good enough times to warrant the down 50% year over year, and it's not specific to TI --
Dave Pahl
Sure, sure.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
-- companies, it's almost every company is saying the same thing. How come without the party we have such a hangover?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. I think that that market has always been choppy, right? And I'll go back to third quarter to fourth quarter of 2011 we saw our revenues fall 40% sequentially. And we think part of the reason is, is that operators announced that they're getting tenders, they're going to spend x billions of dollars. And they typically give their OEMs or our customers a very short period of time to deliver that product. So they've got to get prepared to be able to ship that product when their customers want it. And that just -- and that's the dynamic that drives those cycles more than anything else.
And, you know, it's -- you look at our revenues overall, this year we'll probably ship 60% 4G and 40% 3G. I think last year was balanced, 50/50. We've got a good position across all the major OEMs. We continue to invest in areas like small cell [ph] as an example. So it's a good market. We'll continue to make lots of money in it, be ready to support higher revenues when our customers need it. And it is what it is, you can't control that part of it.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Is there any aspect of the strategic choices you've made in becoming more of an analogy company less digital, so I would assume some of the custom ASICs might not be as higher priority as they once were, and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on that, in the standalone DSPs as well, when you move more analog and less digital, if those two are de-prioritized to any extent, do you think there'd be any TI-specific headwinds or you still would have a pop-up, everybody is down 50%, you'll get better than that, but it might not bounce back as much because of logical strategic choices you've made?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. We've even had some people take the opposite side of that and say, hey, you guys called it just right in cutting your OpEx in this area. Neither of those were the case, right? It's --
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
We both got [ph] --
Dave Pahl
-- have to do that just depending on how you want to look at that, you know, same things through a different corner of the box.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Lots of ways to be wrong --
Dave Pahl
That's right. Our belief is that carrier CapEx will slowly decline when you look over the next 10 and 20 years, it's not going to go to zero. We don't believe that there's the same growth in carrier CapEx as what we've seen over the last 20 years. So that doesn't make it a bad market. It just means that you invest differently when the market exists like that.
A lot of this equipment have -- has life of 10, 15 years. And you think about operators are putting equipment out into the marketplace, there's coexistence issues and compatibility issues, fallbacks that they need to worry about. So this isn't a cell phone cycle that's being replaced every nine months. They have very, very long lifecycles to them.
So we're investing at a rate that we think is appropriate. Still it isn't zero. So we plan to be in that market. It's an important market for us.
And again we talked a little bit about spending money on small cells. We'll get some revenue this year in small cells, but we've been investing at least for five years in it. And just like with 4G, we probably started those investments 15 years ago. So if you started about five years ago, you're probably about 10 years too late.
And so again, long -- great market, long cycles. We like that market. We'll continue to invest in it. And we'll work hard to earn that business with our customers.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So there are two topics that you mentioned, almost in passing but I think are important ones to hit upon. The first was the consignment side. And you mentioned that it gives good visibility. Talk a little bit about the adoption of that, what percentage of the Company is exposed to it. And then on one hand I can see how visibility is better because there's no buffer in between where you're worried about how much inventory is floating around, because you control that and you don't recognize the revenue until they're pulled.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
The flipside of it, say like in the third quarter, it's a backend-loaded quarter, if they all know that the inventory is there waiting for them, it could make things even more backend-weighted because they have the luxury of doing hand-to-mouth. So while on one hand it's more visibility, on the other hand, the orders aren't going to come until the last minute. So, talk about the strategic choices and how much of your business that actually impacts or is delivered that way today.
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, about 60% of our revenue goes through distribution, 60% of that goes through a consignment program today. And if you look at our results, last quarter we ended the quarter with 3-1/2 weeks of inventory at our distributors. That's the lowest number in my career at TI, which is more than 25 years now.
And -- but it's low primarily because of the structural reasons of we're paring [ph] that inventory on our books, you can see that in our inventory numbers. But it's also low because we've been delivering consistently on time and we've had lead times that have been consistent, probably pushing three years now.
And for the reasons, like you say, customers comfortable that they can get product, they don't have to have a big buffer themselves, that's contributing to putting pressure on having less inventory out there. We think that's good, because it gives us better visibility to actually where demand is, at our distributors in particular, we can hold that inventory, and because we control it, we can get it, we can get it to the distributor that may need it or an OEM that needs it, and you don't end up with these large pockets of inventory that end up out there when you don't have that direct control overall.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So it's a good way to boil down demand to being true demand, because they have no reason to, you know, double-booking and all those sorts of issues. The carrying thoughts [ph] of having the inventory would theoretically be the downside, carrying 110 days instead of you used to do, whatever, was 85 or 90 or something like that.
Dave Pahl
Correct, yes. Right.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Got you.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. And that number today is two thigs. One is that -- is the consignment which is an obvious one of we're carrying on our books versus them, but also we structured how -- restructured how we manage our own inventories to ensure more stable lead times, and ensure higher service levels. So, delivering product when we say that we will.
And part of that is, is that during peak periods of weaker demand, we'll build smaller volume products. So as an example of you have a product that runs 10,000 units a year, it may take a half an hour to set up or tear down a piece of assembly test equipment, so -- and it may take you an hour to run those 10,000 parts. Why don't you let it run for four hours and now you got three years of demand that goes into finished goods? So you got confidence you're going to sell that product over the next five and ten years, why not do that? It's out of the way then, so when you have higher volume, higher demands coming through the factory, you're not setting up and tearing down a lot. As you're doing that, you're able to use your assets more effectively.
So there's a lot of different things that are going into why the numbers were it is. And as we talked about earlier, you know, we're actually, a lot of these things are new, so we're using this year to kind of study what's going on. And we talked about the fact that in February, on our capital management call, it's one of the things that we would -- we'd update.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Right. Why don't we -- and again, if you have any questions in the audience, raise your hand. Let's switch over to the margin side of things. Walk us through the gross margin potential of the Company. It's risen very impressively over the last couple of years. Talk about going forward, how much is utilization driven versus depreciation falling off, albeit with a depreciation falling not being a cash benefit to you, but definitely helping the gross margin side.
Dave Pahl
Yes. So, back in February we tried to articulate why we believed we could increase our free cash flow margin, back into the gross margin, because that's the number that we've given, to operate the Company sustainably at 30%. And we put the caveat around it that we've got to be in good markets, and we're just saying, hey, if the world's not falling apart or something weird is going on, we can operate there consistently.
We just turned in 27% free cash flow margins this past quarter, so we've got 300 basis points of improvement. So a big part of that will be the fact that we will build more products on 300-millimeter going forward, as we fill up that $6 billion of capacity, and we enjoy that 40% lower silicon costs.
The other piece, as you said, that's going to contribute to that, is the fixed cost business, right? So we've got that $6 billion of capacity that's running through the P&L today that, you know, you put more product on it, that will fall through nicely as well. We'll get a benefit as we think secularly industrial automotive will grow faster than other markets, and those products tend to have higher gross margins on them too.
And then the last thing, just mechanically of course, the depreciation and CapEx numbers will converge and come down to around the 4% that we plan to spend on CapEx.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So, lots of moving parts on not only the gross margin but also the free cash flow side of it.
Dave Pahl
That's right.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Maybe the last question on my side and the last couple of minutes that we have is on the OpEx side of things. I think one of the biggest changes, at least versus my model in the last couple of years, is your R&D going from 16%, 17% of sales now down to maybe 10 or 9-1/2 or 10. Talk a little bit about the strategic rationale behind getting it that low. And when I've asked in the past at different times how sustainable it is, the answer from yourself, Kevin, Ron, Rich, whomever it may be, the first is, well, we're not actually spending that little on our core areas, we're spending the same amount as our competitors or an appropriate amount. Now it seems like the answer is more of the little to, why don't you ask them why they're spending so much.
So, talk a little bit about how you got it down to that level, because at first approximation that's one of the biggest margin improvements to the free cash flow line out of anything you've done.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. And Ross, you may remember, I think it was a year ago, we actually showed a slide in our capital management where we went back and showed our spend of analog R&D as a percentage of revenue, and you can see that line has whittled around a little bit, I think it was set back to 2006. So, you know, eight years or so of data, where it really hasn't changed. Excuse me [inaudible] sorry.
What changed is we exited wireless and pulled that OpEx off. So in the embedded side, we of course actually increased the amount of money we're spending, and that's impacted the operating margins there. So that spend has been effective, it's translated into share gains. And we've talked a little bit about this before we sat down, we've averaged around 30 to 40 basis points a share gain both in analog as well as in EP.
So it really isn't about just trying to spend more money, it's spending that money effectively and having results from it. And that's what we're trying to do.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So at the end of the day, you have no reason to believe it's anything other than sustainable amount --
Dave Pahl
That's correct, yeah. Yeah.
And, you know, and I know we're running short of time, if I put that into kind of how we think about our business overall, we've got four competitive advantages that we're continuing on investing, so -- and those are things that we've covered here of manufacturing and technology that gives us a cost advantage, the breadth of the product portfolio, the reach of our sales channel, and then our long-lived diverse position.
So, really when we think about it is, can we strengthen those four competitive advantages, and building a broad portfolio, if they're not good products, doesn't matter if you do twice as many of them. So, you know, it's really finding the products that customers want that have a differentiated position, and that's what we're focused on.
Ross Seymore
Great. Well, Dave, thank you very much for coming

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the Web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
I'll start with a quick summary. Revenue declined 2% from a year ago, inclusive of notably weak demand in communications equipment and continued strong demand in automotive. In the quarter, we also had about a $45 million negative impact year over year from currency exchange rates, as expected. Even in this environment, our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing together grew slightly year over year and comprised 85% of second quarter revenue. Analog delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.65, up $0.03 from a year ago.
With that backdrop, Kevin and I will move on to details of our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations was $820 million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing-12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 2 percentage point improvement from the year-ago period, and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter Analog output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will only be valued if it's returned to shareholders who are productively invested in the business. For the trailing-12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
Analog revenue grew 3% from a year ago due to High Volume Analog & Logic. Power Management also grew, Silicon Valley Analog was even, and High Performance Analog declined. As mentioned earlier, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Analog.
Embedded Processing revenue declined 2% from a year ago after 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. This decline was due to the weakness in wireless infrastructure equipment for the Processor product line. In contrast, the Connectivity and Microcontroller product lines grew.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 17% from a year ago due to custom ASIC products, which are highly concentrated in wireless infrastructure equipment. DLP products also declined, while calculators grew.
In distribution, resales increased 8% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory decreased by 1 week to just above 31/2 weeks, which is a historically low level. We believe this inventory level reflects an environment of good product availability due to healthy TI inventories and stable lead times, which together drive high customer service metrics. It's also important to note that inventory in our distribution channel has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how inventory's managed with our consignment program.
Now I'll provide some insight into our revenue performance by end markets versus a year ago, which in total resulted in the revenue in the bottom half of our range due to more significant softness in communications equipment and incremental softness in industrial. Specifically by end market, automotive had strong growth, with almost all sectors inside this market growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was about flat, in contrast to last quarter's year-over-year growth and was incrementally weaker than we expected. More specifically, there was growth in about half the sectors inside of industrial, but these were offset by declines in others.
Personal electronics grew in total due to one large customer. Outside of this customer, almost every sector inside of personal electronics declined, including PCs, as we expected. Communications equipment declined primarily due to the wireless infrastructure sector, which was down about 50% from a year ago, even weaker than we had expected going into the quarter. And enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected.
In general, as we look to the third quarter, the strength in demand varies by end markets, but our market in total is expected to be weaker year over year, and our outlook for TI revenue and earnings is consistent with this environment. While we don't control the near-term environment of our markets, we do control the focus on making TI stronger through our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. These four attributes taken together are at the core of what makes TI unique and capable of long-term free cash flow growth.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion, or 58.2% of revenue. Gross profit was even from the year-ago quarter despite lower revenue, as we benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Gross margin was up 110 basis points.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $790 million were down $31 million from a year ago. The decline reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan, which have been completed. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense.
Operating profit was $1.01 billion, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating profit margin was 31.3% of revenue, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Operating profit margin for Analog was 35.5%. Operating profit margin for Embedded Processing was 19.6%, almost 5 percentage points higher from the year ago, as we focused our investments for growth and now see the benefit from our plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing. Net income in the second quarter was $696 million or $0.65 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $820 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 126, as we had expected. As our business model has evolved, we continue to evaluate our inventory model. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. As a reminder, in April, we retired $250 million of debt. In addition, we issued $500 million of five-year debt at a coupon rate of 1.75%. Including the $750 million of debt due in August of this year, we'll have retired $1 billion while having issued $500 million in debt this year. This is consistent with our practice over the past few years. This will leave total debt of $4.125 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.3%.
On a trailing-12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.1 billion, up 14% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $476 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes the 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed in our February capital management call.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion, or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 13% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. And, as we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the second quarter, we paid $354 million in dividends and repurchased $654 million of our stock for a total return of $1.01 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.08 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.1% over the past 12 months and by 40% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.31 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.26 billion, down 2% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.41 billion in the third quarter. As we've said, while strength in demand varies by end markets, our market in total is expected to be weaker year over year in the third quarter than it was in the second. This includes a negative impact of about $40 million due to changes in currency exchange rates. We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72.
Acquisition charges, which are a noncash amortization charge, will remain even and hold at about $80 million per quarter until the third quarter of 2019. It will then decline to about $50 million per quarter for two additional years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter and for the year.
In summary, even in a weaker market environment, such as we saw in the second quarter and expect in the third, our business model, which is built upon the four attributes that Dave mentioned earlier, delivers strong free cash flow. As a reminder, these attributes are our approach to manufacturing and technology, the breadth of our product portfolio, the reach of our market channels, and our diverse and long-lived positions. We believe these attributes, in combination, are unique to TI and they are sustainable, giving us the ability to provide continuing returns to our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Keith?

We can take our first question from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess a little bit of a longer-term question. Could you just give us your sense – having the benefit of six, seven months of hindsight – on why the semi market is kind of sucking wind right now? And then I think the last time things were like this was 2011 and 2012, so if you could give us a sense of comparison on how things are right now versus 2011 and 2012? Is it better? Is it worse? Is it the same? Do we not know?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Chris, I'll go ahead and take a stab at that, I guess. I think that what we're seeing right now is basically customers adjusting their expectations as to the growth rates for the remainder of the year. And just toning down a little bit on where they're at. We actually believe what we're seeing is more a symptom of like a macro-based kind of event. The market's getting a bit more cautious, especially with all the news flow in the financial markets, things you hear out of Europe, things you hear out of China. But the fact is the signs that we're seeing suggest to us that we're in a traditional kind of market, macro driven, not necessarily a semi cycle per se. We continue to see lead times are quite short, cancellations remain low, distributor inventories at historically low levels, as Dave mentioned. So all things put together, I think what we're just seeing is a growth rate on a macro level that's probably slower going in the second half than what people thought coming into the first half.
As to comparisons to 2011-2012, there were too many things going on back then. We had earthquake events in Japan that I can recall. We had flooding in Thailand. I don't think these are really comparable events that we can talk about on that front, Chris.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Do you have a follow-on?
Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, I guess just to dig in a little more. Maybe can you give us a little color on linearity? And then in terms of the end markets, you talked about softness in communication and the new softness in industrial. Maybe just go down your end markets as far as which is stable, which is getting better, which is getting worse?
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Okay. So I'll just make a comment on both revenue and order linearity in the quarter. In both cases, revenue and orders increased each month during the quarter. I think as you look at the end market detail, as I just had walked through in general, we saw automotive was strong, with all the sectors inside of that growing – or all but one growing at double-digit rates. Industrial revenue was flat. Just contrasting that to last quarter's year-over-year growth, we didn't see growth there. And it was incrementally weaker than we had expected. And as we had talked about inside of there, we really saw about half of the sectors increase, and that, of course, was offset by declines in the other sectors.
Personal electronics, as we talked about, grew in total, due to specifically one large customer. And outside of that customer, actually saw almost every sector decline, including PCs, as we were expecting. Comms infrastructure, as we mentioned, was impacted by – or comms equipment was impacted by wireless infrastructure, and that was down 50% from a year ago. So – and that actually was weaker than what we had expected when we started the quarter. And then the last, enterprise systems declined due to DLP projectors, as we had expected. So that's kind of a summary of what we saw by end market.
So thanks, Chris, and we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
Okay, and that question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the Q2 results, you talked about incrementally weaker trends in Industrial. This has been a particular focus by the market. Can you just talk about the geographical trends within your industrial business? There's a lot of concern around demand trends in industrial in Europe and China. Love to get some color from you guys.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Sure, Harlan, so let me just tell you what happened with the revenues in the quarter. So year-over-year revenue was down, as we mentioned before, 2%. Europe was down the most, and Japan was also down. Asia was flat, while the U.S. was up. From a sequential standpoint, revenue was up, led by the U.S. Asia and Europe were both about even sequentially while Japan was down.
So we're always cautious. We'll give you that information and walk through it, but we're always cautious, because that's reflective of where we ship product versus where it's actually consumed. So – and it's really hard for us to see regional weakness unless it's extremely pronounced in a market like industrial, just because of the tens of thousands of customers that make up that market.
So do you have a follow-on, Harlan?
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Sure. So I think last quarter you said – the team said that they were going to bring down utilizations. Did you in fact bring them down? And, directionally, where do you expect them to head into the third quarter? And dollar inventory stayed relatively flat. Does the team expect this to come down in Q3, just given the weaker demand profile?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Harlan, the – in fact we did reduce utilization in the factories in the second quarter. And inventory actually came in right about where we expected that, 126 days. And given the outlook that we have just described to you, we do intend to further reduce factory utilization in the third quarter, and we expect the result of that is that our inventories will probably come down somewhat in the third quarter as a result of the reductions that were planned for Q3 as well as the Q2. It just takes a while for that to flow through the system.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Great. Thank you, Harlan. And next caller, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to James Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. First question is on consolidation. And you guys have been very clear in your articulation of what you look for and what the parameters are over time. But I have a couple specific questions about consolidation in the current environment. Does the current environment, where revenues for the industry are in some pretty sharp declines – does that change the view on near-term consolidation potential in the sense that you worry about paying a multiple for a cash flow stream that's going to wind up being much lower over the next 12, 18, 24 months than what it currently is? Or does that create more of an incremental opportunity? I'd love your perspective on that.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Jim, the timing doesn't enter into our thinking. So with some of the points you just brought up – although they make for interesting discussion, they don't actually alter the way we tend to think about M&A. As we've discussed in the past, the first and most important thing is that any potential M&A consideration has to be consistent with our strategy. And in our mind that's going be something that's going to be focused on helping drive our success in the Analog space.
And then beyond that, as you were alluding to in your comments there, we have been and expect to continue to be quite disciplined on making sure that we can get a return on what we've spent. Clearly, at some of the prices today that you might see of certain companies out there and you factor in a premium – I'm looking at what I've seen in some other companies – getting a 3% return, 4% return doesn't seem like a good long-term strategy for maximizing shareholder value. And so our inclination is to make sure returns can see their way past our cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe, and we'll stay disciplined on that front.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.
That's very helpful. Thank you. And for the follow-up, how do you think about what the company's long-term growth rate is in this environment? I mean, it was good last year. We're in a tougher environment now. We're kind of down on a year-over-year basis for revenues this quarter and maybe flattish for the year if we look at normal seasonality for the back half. This might be overly negative to kind of take this snapshot in time for long-term growth. Maybe last year was overly positive. Do you think something kind of in between what you'll achieve this year and what you achieved last year is a reasonable view on what long-term normalized revenue growth could be?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
I think you're probably thinking about it right, Jim, is that you should look at it over periods of time like that, and not start from the wrong quarter. At a high level, we take a look, and we make the assumption that the semiconductor market will continue to grow at, call it, 2x the global GDP, and that's on increased content into industrial and automotive that will continue to drive demand. It's then a question of what do you think the GDP's going to do over the long term, the global GDP?
And clearly it does appear that – and certainly in the last three, four years, and probably the next few years, it has been slower than what we saw in the prior decade or decade before that. So the overall industry is, again, in our view, will probably grow at about 2x the global GDP, and the global GDP is the real wildcard here, is trying to figure out how fast that'll grow. And we're preparing ourselves for the fact that it probably doesn't see any real robust growth to help us, and therefore we have to focus on execution and making ourselves stronger internally.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah. And I'd add to that, that our business model is robust. Even in a weak environment like this, it throws off lots of cash. And we've got the capacity to support much stronger rates of growth, if that were to show up. So it'll be a lot more fun if we get into an environment where GDP growth is stronger and everyone can argue what the multiplier on semiconductor growth rates overall are. But we can still operate and produce lots of cash even in these weaker markets. And we'll look forward to having more fun when it's stronger.
So thanks, Jim, and -
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Sounds good. Thank you.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Okay. Go to our next caller, please.
Operator
And the next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Kevin, I guess the first question is you took some utilization action in the June quarter, but gross margins were actually up sequentially and very healthy. Is the right way to think about this is the June quarter utilization actions impact September, September impacts December? And, specifically, can you help me think about how I should be thinking about the gross margin range in the September quarter around some of the utilization actions you're taking?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, so Jim, we've got a couple things going on there. Clearly as we see more of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive, that has an attractive profit mix. And so you saw some of that in the second quarter. You heard Dave's prepared remarks talking about strength in automotive that we saw in the quarter. So that's clearly having a benefit to our gross margins, even in the light of lightening up on our utilization a little bit. You are correct in that utilization changes don't have an immediate impact. They tend to – it takes a few months for it to roll through the system, so some of that was in second quarter. More of it will be in third quarter.
We also have lower overall manufacturing costs; as we're beginning to see depreciation starting to slowly trickle off we're becoming much more efficient in our factories; we're getting more and more of our revenue off of much lower-cost 300 millimeter. So you've got a number of things combined that are keeping those margins in a pretty healthy state. As we look into next quarter, I wouldn't expect a significant – any kind of material change in that particular metric in third quarter.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful. As then as my follow-up, guys, you guys are constantly kind of pruning the portfolio. One of the things that's been talked about is whether or not you're going to plan to do sort of power on the new Skylake platform. I'm just kind of curious as to how the PC business and your desire to want to participate there is impacting either the June quarter results or, more importantly, the guide in September? Is there sort of a hit coming because you're not going to participate there? Again, if there is, can you help us quantify the size of the PC business today and kind of where it goes over time?
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah. So, John, what you're seeing in our results has nothing to do with the investments on a Vcore product line. And I'll just say that we continually look at our investments, and we want to obviously invest in places where we think that that will lead to sustainable revenue, a differentiated position and solid returns. So there's portions within Vcore that are more attractive and less commoditized than others. So we're continuing to make those investments. So we know that there have been rumors out there that we're exiting the space in total, and that's not true.
But, again, these are fairly small tweaks to where we direct our R&D resources. And those teams are off investing in other areas and producing products that we believe will just give us longer-term better results. So I'll contrast that to a market where we may have exited like wireless, where we're actually reducing and exiting a market. And we're not doing that here.
So I hope that helps. We can go to our next caller, please.
Operator
And the next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys. A product mix question first: Within your Analog space, you guys obviously have done a great job over time. A little curious as to an explanation why the HVAL side is growing so much faster year over year over the last couple quarters versus HPA specifically? I recall asking questions about HPA investments in the past, and that seemed to be an area of extreme focus given its high profitability. But the growth doesn't seem to be keeping up with HVAL. So any color on that will be helpful.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Sure, Ross. Yeah, I think when you look at both SVA, as well as HPA, those businesses have different exposures to various end markets. And actually both of those businesses have a higher exposure to both industrial as well as communications equipment. You'll see a business like HVAL that will have a higher exposure to personal electronics.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
And automotive.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
And automotive. Yeah, good point. So that's really what you're seeing in those results. Do you have a follow-up?
Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Switching gears quickly, but kind of a follow-on to John's earlier question, any sort of color you can provide on the OpEx side. It's helpful to have gross margin relatively flattish, but how do you adjust the OpEx given that the revenues have been a little challenged looking forward?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Ross, we've already taken action on the OpEx side. We had announced, I think a year and a half ago now, actions that we were taking in Embedded Processing and Japan, and those are pretty much complete now. You're seeing those benefit OpEx in the results that we turned in the last couple quarters. These short-term fluctuations in revenue – we don't let those lead us to rash decisions that could have a negative impact on us. We make longer-term decisions based upon strategy.
As we look into third quarter, if you look at the last couple of years, 2Q to 3Q, OpEx has been flat to roughly down. I don't expect anything different than recent history as we go into third quarter of this year.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Ross. And we can go to our next caller, please.
Operator
And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. For the first question, you mentioned this 50% decline in wireless infrastructure. If you could help us quantify what proportion of your sales that is now versus last year? And the thing that I'm really curious about is that – and it's not just a Texas Instruments question; we are seeing that from Xilinx and others – that there is really no slowdown in mobile data consumption, there is no slowdown in LTE users, so why are you seeing such a large decline in wireless infrastructure buildouts? Is it just an excess inventory of base stations? Is it a move away from your products? Is it a share issue? If you could help me understand that, that would be very helpful.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Sure, yeah. So, Vivek, our communications equipment market is – at the end of last year was about 17%. But the largest sector inside of that was wireless infrastructure at about 10%. So we've given you the color on half the size. We haven't gone through all the end equipment percentages, but that'll get you into the ZIP code of the impact to our business.
And it's interesting that you bring it up. It continues to actually be a very good market for us. It's one that we're continuing to make investments. We had dialed back some of the investments a year or so ago inside of Embedded Processing, and that's really a view that that market over time, that carrier CapEx isn't going to go up, that it probably will decline slightly as we look over the next five and 10 years and perhaps longer. But carrier CapEx isn't going to zero. And that revenue will return. It has been notoriously just a choppy market. And it's just the dynamics of the market, the way that the tenders go out, the way that the OEMs have to prepare to deliver that product. Oftentimes it's in a 30- or 60-day window, so this isn't new to us. We're used to it. We can still make a lot of money and generate a lot of cash from this market, so we'll continue to do that. But it is just choppy. So that's just a characteristic. And I think as you talk to other semiconductor suppliers that supply into that market, that's pretty consistent, I think, with what all of us see.
So do you have a follow-up, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Thanks, Dave. So on my follow-up, wondering if 75% is still that right incremental gross margin number to think of, because you are guiding sales at the midpoint to go up somewhat, but you're saying gross margins will be flattish. And as part of that, does this slowdown in sales have any impact on how soon you move your capacity over to 300 millimeter? Thank you.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Vivek, the 75% fall-through is still probably a pretty good one to use, but keep in mind that it's noisy from quarter to quarter. It's something you should look over a multiquarter period as you move through time. Clearly you'll get good product margin fall-through as we go into next quarter, but as I mentioned we're also dialing back some of the factory starts, so you have moving parts inside there. But when you look over a longer period of time than just a quarter, that's when you start seeing that 75%.
As to migrating product to – I think you said 450 millimeter.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
He meant 300 millimeter.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Okay. I was going to say, we don't have that on the radar.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
He's thinking well ahead, yeah.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
For 300 millimeter, we will continue to do what we have been doing in the past, and that is many of our new products that are released are being released on 300 millimeter, and that becomes even more valuable to the company as we move forward. Keep in mind what we talked back in the February capital call, that is in addition to our Richardson fab, which is capable of about $5 billion of total 300-millimeter Analog revenue, we have also begun the conversion of our DMOS6 factory, which will provide an additional $3 billion of Analog revenue capability. So with that kind of conversion under way, clearly new products that we're releasing are being biased towards 300 millimeter versus 200. Active products on 200, for the most part, will continue where they're at.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah. And I'll just add to that, as we had indicated before, the qualification, as Kevin said, of DMOS6 second version is under way, and we expect the qualification to be completed by the end of the year. We're still on track for that.
So thank you, Vivek, and we can go to the next caller, please.

And the next question comes from Christopher Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Yes, thank you. I wanted to dig into the industrial market a little more deeply. You had talked about that being a bit weaker than expected in the quarter. And then – recognize that you're going into one of the seasonally weaker quarters for industrial. And I'm sure you heard the commentary from one of your competitors earlier today. Can you help us to just get some perspective on what your customers are telling you in that market? And I know you don't like to give commentary going forward on what's baked into your guidance, but to just kind of help ground us in how you're thinking about that particular market at this point?
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah. Chris, not a lot to add. We did – it was – again, use the word incrementally weaker. We gave you the color that we saw growth in half the sectors, and that was offset. So even inside of that, there's a bit of choppiness. I think as we look forward, obviously as we get the demand signals both in orders as well as from what we can see from consignment, through our distributors, there's signals that we look at there. And as Kevin mentioned earlier, I think people are just taking a more cautious outlook into third quarter. So besides that, probably don't have too much to add. Kevin, I don't know if you -
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, the only thing I'd remind you of is that industrial was 31% of our revenue in 2014. And my recollection is that no single sector in that market was bigger than 4%. So we're talking about a lot of really small customers. So there's not really one customer that can give us a signal what's going on. It seems to be a broad-based reconsideration on the part of participants in that space as to their outlook for growth for the second half.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Good point. Chris, do you have a follow-on?
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Sure. Just as following onto that, perhaps you could talk about what you think customers are doing with inventory now? And I know you had talked about your distributors taking some inventory out of the channel again as they likely reconsider what's going on in the second half. Do you expect that the end customers are doing similar? And, on top of that, what do you expect the distributors do with inventory as they go forward? Do you think the inventory levels can get leaner than where they are right now?
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah. So in general we believe that customer inventories are lean. As we worked our way through the reports and some of the anecdotal – from last quarter's reports, as well as the anecdotal information that we get from our sales teams. And of course there's always the exceptions like within wireless infrastructure, as that market goes through its adjustments.
So with inventory in our distributors at 31/2 weeks, that is a historically low period in my tenure as well as Kevin's. So – and we really think that's reflective, Chris, of confidence from distributors that they believe that they can get the product that they need from us. Obviously it's driven overall because of the consignment programs that allow them just operationally to run at those levels. And I think there is a belief that confidence in stable lead times and availability of product is probably working its way out into the customer base as well; harder for us to actually have that direct visibility. As Kevin talked about, we're talking 100,000 customers, so it's hard to have that collectively.
So thanks, Chris, and I will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And we'll go to Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Yes. Thank you. Kevin, you talked about orders increasing every month in the quarter. Do you have any order commentary quarter to date? And I'm assuming we're entering Q3 with a relatively strong backlog. How much more conservative are turns order assumptions to meet guidance?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah. Ian, as we did mention earlier on, orders increased each month in the second quarter, and I will just say as to orders for this quarter, they're consistent with the guidance range that we gave early in the call. We did have a book-to-bill in second quarter of 1.01, so we did build a little bit of backlog, but I wouldn't call it a dramatic amount. It's consistent, though, I think, with the outlook that we have offered for third quarter.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah. And I'll just remind you, Ian – I'm sure you probably know that we've got 60% of our revenues that go through distribution. 60% of that is supported by consignment, and about 55% of TI's revenues overall is by consignment. So I'd just be careful with the book-to-bill, and part of the reason why we don't highlight it is because it just applies to a smaller portion of our actual revenues, and that backlog isn't necessarily reflective completely of the demand that we actually see.
So do you have a follow-on?
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Yes. I think you've done a really good job of highlighting your competitive advantages – broad portfolio, growing into your manufacturing assets. I mean, what's the response, though, to scenarios where there could be some demand in end markets on a permanent secular decline? I mean, if you look at comms infrastructure, PCs, some of the consumer markets, I mean, how do you address the potential for some permanent declines in some of these end markets?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Well, there's – been in this for quite a long time, Ian – there's always some market that's in decline and other markets that are actually in a growth phase. So the examples you just offered, if in fact they turn out to be in a secular decline, the offsetting markets for that, the most obvious one is automotive, where we're seeing significant content growth – not just us but many in the industry – seeing significant content growth. And we're still in the very early stages of that content penetrating automobiles. So that's probably a secular growth market that I would suggest would probably add for a decade or more. So that's a great opportunity for the industry in general and for us in particular, because we've been focused on there for a number of years now.
And then there's the broader industrial market, where we're seeing an increasing usage of semiconductors and equipment in those markets that simply were never used before. And as people are using semiconductors in those spaces they're finding new applications and needs for more semiconductors. So while there may be some markets or sectors that could be in secular decline, there are others that are in secular growth. And in general, that leads us to the belief that I commented on earlier in the call, that we think the industry overall will grow at about 2x the global GDP because you've got these kind of underlying changes going on in how semiconductors are being used across our economy.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah, and I could add, too, that even if you look at a market like PCs that probably over the next 10 years and 20 years will be on a decline like that, we can take two actions. One is we'll spend differently today than we would have spent 10 years and 15 years ago inside of that market. But we can still find opportunities where products will actually live through one product cycle to the next and still have long-lived positions even inside of a market like that. And certainly PCs aren't going away anytime soon. So there's still quite a bit of money that can be made in those markets.
So thank you, Ian, and we can go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And we can take the next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Thank you. Dave and Kevin, we're just trying to understand the difference in the commentary on the order patterns that you guys are seeing versus Linear. Same kind of diversified businesses; in fact, they have very similar – they don't have consumer as you do, but then you also had infrastructure, which is down very hard. So could you help us understand what's going on there? And then I had a very quick follow-up.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
You know, Ambrish, I cannot offer you any insight into Linear's order patterns. They clearly are the most qualified to do that. I can simply tell you what we saw, and that is our orders increased each of the three months as we came through – or two of the three months. In other words, May was up over April, and June was up over May as we came through 2Q. We certainly are in different markets, and that could possibly be an explanation, but I just don't know enough about how their order book works to be able to help you with a contrast between the two companies.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay. That's fair, Kevin. My follow-up is on the factory loadings. Is the right way to also think about, when you're bringing the utilization down, that's mostly on the 200 millimeter, and the 300 millimeter continues to creep up?
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
That's actually not a bad way to think about it, Ambrish, because in fact the way that we are operating the 300-millimeter fab today, our fab, is near full equipped utilization. In other words, we don't have it equipped to full capacity, but to the extent that we have it equipped, we try to keep it quite highly loaded. So the adjustments that we take on loadings generally impact the 200. There may be some impact in 300 as well, but it generally would impact the 200-millimeter factories.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah. And I'll just add that any product that runs any measurable volume will often source in multiple factories, so it could actually be sourced in a 200-millimeter fab as well as a 300-millimeter fab. And as you know, the economics of getting 40% lower cost per chip on a 300-millimeter obviously will tilt us into starting that 300-millimeter wafer.
So thank you, Ambrish. And we can go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, not to beat a dead horse, but I guess another one on the industrial sector, is what kind of exposure do you have to the energy patch and your vision for whether that business has troughed and/or there's further declines ahead?
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah, C.J., as Kevin pointed out, last year 31% of our revenues industrial. The largest sector inside of industrial is factory automation. And that was 4%, so you're probably down well in – getting into the very low single-digit percentages by the time you're down onto that. So it's very, very diverse from that standpoint. Do you have a follow-up?
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI
Yeah. I do. I guess given your perspective in terms of your leverage to personal electronics, calculators, DLP, would love to hear your thoughts on the global consumer and the health of the consumer and willingness to step up and spend during this macro malaise or pause or whatever you want to call it.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Well, if you look at our personal electronics market, it was actually up. And it was up because of our exposure in our customer base. So to the extent that there's compelling products out there that people want, that will drive demand. So you see that stepping up. You take that one customer out, of course, we saw declines in almost every sector inside of personal electronics. So you kind of have the good with the bad, somewhat of a mix on that front.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, I might just add it's probably not so much consumer willingness to consume those things. It's more is there something interesting for them to spend their money on. And certain customers are much more successful at that than others.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you. C.J., did you have a follow-up? No, okay. Maybe one last caller, please.
Operator
Okay. And we can go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you so much. Actually I had two. I guess first of all, if you look at 2015 as the whole year, usually you're targeting to sort of grow roughly 2x GDP. We don't know what GDP is going be, but if you assume a seasonal fourth calendar quarter, it implies that revenue this year is down like 250 basis points. So it definitely seems to be undergrowing whatever GDP comes out to be this this year. So I guess my question is do you think that any of this is share? Will you end up to have lost any market share this year? I know you usually target up about 40 bps per year. And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah. Tim, so what we're talking about, again, long-term growth rate was how the questions asked earlier, and long-term growth rate, we believe, will be about 2x global GDP. Just like you see noise in the quarters, you're probably going to see noise in the years. For example, last year the industry arguably grew considerably faster than 2x global GDP. This year it's apt to grow less than global GDP. So I think you're just going to have that kind of noise to deal with. I don't think it can be mechanically imposed into a formula with precision.
As we look out, for the reasons that we talked about, increasing penetration in certain markets especially auto and industrial, that will continue to require semiconductor content, and there'll be growth inside that. From a market share standpoint, we'll be able to answer that at the end of the year. But I'd say we're off to a darn good start so far.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Yeah. And I'd just point out that when you look at our market share gains, they've averaged 30 to 40 basis points. We've had years where we've eked out 10 basis points, and a knockout year is 100 basis points. So inside of that, we've had a range of outcomes. So do you have a follow-on, Tim?
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
I do. Yes, thanks. So the guidance is like 400 basis points below what the five-year seasonal is. Maybe you talked about this and I sort of missed it. But can you sort of try to pinpoint what – the primary sort of either geography or end market that can potentially explain that gap? I guess I'm thinking about China in particular. Can you just sort of help us cover that gap? Thanks.
Kevin P. March - Senior VP, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah, Tim, we don't believe that there's something called a seasonal average in our space. When you go and take a look at any of those quarters, the variation is so wide that there's not really anything meaningful in there. I think you look at those 2Q to 3Q growth rates and you see zeros to high-single digits, and I don't think you can divine too much out of that.
I think we have to look at it in the context of the current global environment. Certainly a lot of negative news flow coming out of Europe and some out of China and so on. We had a slow start to the year in the Americas because of weather and the port issues on the West Coast. So I think what we're seeing is what we talked about early in the call, which is that on a macro level, our customers are looking and adjusting their expectation for growth in the second half, and they're tweaking that down a little bit, versus what they had anticipated coming into the year.
David Pahl - Director-Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you very much, Tim. And with that, thank you all for joining. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.
Operator
Okay. And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Good day. Welcome to the Texas Instruments 1Q 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's Web site. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Revenue growth of 6% from a year ago was within the range of expectations we provided in January. Automotive and industrial markets were strong as we expected they would be. However revenue was in the bottom half of the range for two reasons. First was weak demand in the last month of the quarter and our personal electronics market, particularly PCs and our communications equipment market, particularly wireless infrastructure. We believe these markets specific issues were due to delay of investments by carriers and capacity upgrades for wireless infrastructure equipment and a weaker than expected refresh cycle for Windows XP. 
The second reason was a steep decline in the currency exchange rate for the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The Euro dropped about 10% during the quarter an even though only about 5% of TI's revenues transacted in Euros it was a sharp enough drop that it negatively impacted our revenue by about 20 million more than we had anticipated. 
Even with these pockets of weaknesses our core business of analog and embedded processing turned in their seventh and tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth respectively. Combine these businesses grew 9% and we're 86% of our total revenue. 
Earnings per share were $0.61 reflecting our continued attention to cost controls although the vast majority of our revenue was transacted in U.S. dollars ROE negatively impacted revenue by 20 million which translated to only about 5 million of impact to earnings and therefore cash flow.
 This is due to a partial natural hedged against negative currency fluctuations due to our non U.S. based operations. It's nice to have position to be in this when we have almost 90% of our revenue comes outside of the U.S. But that is a backdrop, Kevin and I will move on with our report on business performance that we believe continues to represent the ongoing strength of TI's business model. 
In the first quarter our cash flow from operations was $609 million. We believe that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months period was $3.6 billion, up 17% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a two percentage point improvement from a year ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300 millimeter output and the opportunistic purchases of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe this free cash flow will be valued only if it’s returned to shareholders or productively invested in the businesses. For the trailing 12 months period we return 4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. In the first quarter TI revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago primarily due to power management and high volume analog and logic. Silicon Valley analog and high performance analog also grew. 
As we mentioned earlier this is the seventh quarter of year-over-year growth for analog. Embedded processing revenue grew 2% from a year ago due to micro controllers and connectivity. Processor revenue declined which was impacted by the weakness in wireless infrastructure and again as I mentioned earlier this is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for embedded processing. In our other segment, revenues declined 10% from a year ago primarily due to custom ASIC products which also are heavy in wireless infrastructure as well as DLP products.
In distribution, re-sales increased 11% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory remained at historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks which is a decrease by more than a week from a year ago and is even with the fourth quarter. This level has decreased over the past few years because we have structurally changed how our inventory is managed and the distribution channel with our consignment program.
From an end-market perspective versus a year ago, automotive grew with most factors inside this market growing at double digit rates. Industrial had broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew although growth in PCs was lower than we expected. Communications equipment declined due to wireless infrastructure and enterprise systems grew.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion or 57.7% of revenue. Gross profit increased 13% from a year-ago quarter and gross profit was up almost 4 points. Gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory load-ins and benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy as we built more analog chips on 300 millimeter wafers.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $777 million were down $68 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing in Japan that were previously announced. As we said that restructuring was essentially complete at the end of last year.
Acquisition charges were $83 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles which is non-cash expense. Operating profit was $958 million or 30.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 35.4%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 18.3% more than doubling from a year ago as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing as we benefit from our investments for growth. Net income in the first quarter was $656 million or $0.61 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Flow from operations was $609 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 124 about three days more than planned due to revenue coming in at the bottom half of our expectations. Capital expenditures were $123 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $4.04 billion, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $431 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue, which includes our $8 billion, 300 millimeter analog plan discussed in our recent capital management call.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 17% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or protectively reinvested in the business. As we've noted our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.03 billion. Total cash returned in past 12 months was $4.14 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.2% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.30 billion of cash in short term investments. TI's U.S. entities owned 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.21 billion, up 5% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion in the second quarter. This represents continuing weakness in our communications equipment and personal electronics markets particularly for wireless infrastructure equipment and PCs respectively. We also do not expect a near term rebound in foreign currency exchange rates. We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. Acquisition charges which are our non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.
In summary, we believe that the first quarter demonstrated the strength of TI's business model. While we're not immune to demand in currency changes, their affects are soften by the diversity of our portfolio in our markets.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Kevin. Operator, you can now open the line up for questions. In order to provide as many of as possible and opportunity to ask your question please limit yourself to a single question. After our response we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
"
2015-04-22,Q&A," Session
Thank you (Operator Instructions). And we go first to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Q - Jim Covello
Thanks so much for giving me the chance to ask a question. There is so much controversy in the industry today about whether the industry is as cyclical as it used to be less so, et cetera. I look at your year-over-year growth rates, the June quarter represents the first time you’ve had a year-over-year decline at the midpoint of your guidance in a long time. How do you think about that in the context of an industry where many are arguing that we’re not cyclical anymore?
Kevin March
We’re as you know we’ve been pretty guarded at trying to predict the cycle it’s not something obviously that we can control. We really just go to what we can look and what we can measure. So, as you kind of tick through the things that you typically look at from a cyclical standpoint, we look at channel inventories are down a week from a year ago they’re laying at just under 4.5 weeks. Lead time are remaining consistent our cancellations and rescheduled are very low. In addition we’re continuing to deliver on time and very consistently with that.
So we’ve got a couple of pockets of weaker than expected demands as we talked about specifically in wireless infrastructure and PCs. At the same time we’re seeing automotive and industrial continuing to be as strong as we expect. So that’s what we know, that’s what we can see, the debates will continue on how cyclical our industry will be and won’t be.
Dave Pahl
I might just add that we do have several significant competitive advantages. The combination of which we believe is pretty difficult for anybody else to replicate and it helps us deal with any notion of cyclicality or non-cyclicality. And those advantages include that we’ve got the broadest portfolio in the industry. This really means the engineers start their design work by looking at us first. We enjoy very low cost of manufacturing for all the reasons that you’ve heard us talk about for last few years including our 300 millimeter wafer fabs. We have the broadest sales channel in fact probably two to four times larger than our nearest competitor. And we play in an extremely diverse set of markets with long-lived products that enjoy a significant cash returns to our shareholders for long time. So we think that what’s really important to deal with whatever really happened in market cycles and just really make sure that we’re a lot more competitively advantages than anybody else.
Jim Covello
Obviously you’re talking about some weakness in PCs and coms. In the industrial segment, we’re starting to see some negative news flow from the customers. Do you see pockets of weakness but there is just other pockets of strength that are offsetting those industrial customers that maybe weak because I know it’s a very broad based customer base? Or do you just not see any weakness at all in that segment at this point? Thanks very much.
Kevin March
Jim, I’ll just say that like you are hinting to its very broad based, so we service over 100,000 customers most of those will reside in industrial. And again I think it’s probably helpful for me to just go through and when we say industrial it means something different than I think, the investment definition of industrial. So, it will include things like factory automation and control and medical, healthcare, fitness products building automations, smart grid, energy test equipment, motor drives, display, space avionics, appliances and other segments, so again very-very broad. Of course we’ll always see pockets of strength and weaknesses but overall that industrial is doing well we’ve seen growth in almost all those sectors that I’ve described.
Operator
And we’ll go now to Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely
Dave, you did a good job of outlying I guess the relative areas of weakness in Q1 from currency and com and PC. Can you just give us which you think would be a bigger drag in terms of company sales from PC versus communications? And then do you guys expect a negative impact from currency in Q2 as well and if you could give us the magnitude of that negative impact?
Dave Pahl
So the one that’s pretty straight forward to identify because it’s really just math walking through the numbers is that on year-on-year basis we’ll probably see about a $50 million headwind due to currency exchange rates and obviously we’re not assuming that we see a rebound in those rates. We’ll still see and expect to see the weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure. And it’s kind of in the -- the balance of the business is as you know there is always puts and takes as an example second quarter a year ago DLP was very strong if you remember, it was benefiting from several world events one of them like the World Cup, that won’t repeat. So, that will be weaker than it was a year ago and will continue for the rest of the year.
But inside of that bucket we’ll continue to have puts and takes. The other comment that I’d just make on that that although we see those pockets of weakness if you look at the core businesses and analog and embedded we do believe that those will continue to perform well.
You have a follow up Chris?
Chris Danely
Yes, actually the couple of clarification, do we expect the PC or the wireless infrastructure to have a bigger drag on your revenue in Q2 or then it almost seems like -- do we need the dollar to weaken again for that impact to go way, i.e. if the dollar remains strong is that going to be like a negative for you guys every quarter.
Dave Pahl
Chris, I’d say that we probably don’t have enough detail to tell you whether wireless infrastructure or PC which is going to be of a drag, we just don’t expecting them to be recovering in the second quarter. As it relates to ROE recently with -- if you take a look at the just the euro alone versus a year ago it’s down 23%. The yen is down 14%. We roughly average about 5% of our revenue in euros and around 3% in yen. So clearly with that weakness on a year-over-year compare that’s going to continue to be an issue that’s going to just affect that kind of math. It doesn’t affect our ability to sell in those markets. We continue to make very competitive in those spaces and we enjoy on the design wins. But unless the ROE moves back and dollars weaken than certainly with that kind of dramatic decline in those two major currencies that will be at least on the fringes a year-over-year compare headwind for us. 
Kevin March
And I will just add to that like we saw in the first quarter where we had an impact of about $20 million, because of natural hedging we’ve got the impact to operating profit and free cash flow is really only about $5 million. So, fairly small on that front. Okay, thanks Chris and we’ll move on to the next caller please.
Operator
We now go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer 
Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for to let me ask the question. I guess I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but just on the outlook, when I look at the Q1 it looks like you guys are only missing the mid points of your guide by about 50 million and you explained 20 million of that on currency. As I go to Q2 if I just kind of anchor against seasonality you’re kind of missing it by 150 million to 200 million and I guess sequentially are you expecting anymore kind of headwinds from currency? I understand the year-over-year compare I’m trying to figure out the sequential compare. And when I look at PCs plus comp infrastructure, help me to understand the percent of the business that represents, I’m thinking around 15; maybe I’m wrong with that. I guess I’m trying to get a sense as to why you think that the miss in Q2 is going to be so much larger than those two buckets in the mess in Q1.
Dave Pahl
John let me, I’ll take the first part of the question and Kevin can add in if he like to. The first, if you look at our PC revenues as a percentage of our total is around 4% if you were to include hard drives into that that will add a few points, so you will be just under 10% in upper single digits. If you look at wireless infrastructure last year it was about 10% of our revenue so obviously combined there you’re in the mid-teen. So that will give you an idea of what that impact is. Again as Kevin kind of walked through the math of like the euros an example, last year 18% of our revenue was down in Europe about a third of that so 5% to 6% is transacted in euro and again sequentially, Kevin if you have any additional comments on the impact of the euro.
Kevin March
Yes, I think just 1Q to 2Q, I think is what you’re trying to ask whether John, the average ROE that we experienced on our billions in 1Q was about -- for the euro was about 1.13 and for planning purposes we’re using 1.06 going into 2Q. This it is going to be little bit of a just a quarter-over-quarter ROE impact, just from that standpoint as it relates to the euro. Right now we’re anticipating it again to be pretty flat. 
Dave Pahl
Any follow on John?
John Pitzer 
Yes. I know that was in the comp section specifically you guys were doing a little bit of pruning what’s the product portfolio and I’m wondering if any of the pruning that you’ve done is being reflected in kind of either sequential or year-over-year growth rate. So do you feel like that that’s not a factor as you look at the June guide?
Dave Pahl
Yes, we don’t believe that is a factor John. I think if you look at the impact that wireless infrastructure has, we sell more analog product than we do embedded or the custom ASIC products. So it actually hit both analog, embedded and other. Of course you can see the impact more significantly in embedded and other because it’s a higher percentage of that revenue. But again we’ve got a good position really across to most of the major OEMs there and so what we’re seeing is really a change in chips and demand. Thanks John. And we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We’ll go now to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon 
First I was wondering if you can give us a handle on where you see OpEx going next quarter, given the revenue short fall.
Kevin March
Stacy, OpEx was up about as expected both quarter the first quarter and recall that, in the fourth quarter we typically down a bit on OpEx because of seasonality for holidays and so on. In the absence of those seasonality -- those holidays in the first quarter along with our annual pay and benefit increases; traditionally drives are OpEx up quarter over quarter. Those pay and benefit increases kick it in February so it’s really only two months’ worth inside the OpEx in first quarter. So we'll have the full three months, so you see a just very slight increase going to the second quarter.
Stacy Rasgon 
Got it, thank you, that's helpful. For my follow up, again on currency, I know you guys are pointing to sort of direct translation effects. We've had other players who have pointed to demand destruction from currency. I was wondering if you can give us your point of view on what you're seeing more broadly in the market. Not just to your revenues but also for your customers, are you seeing any sort of broad based [can] destruction because of the currency moments that we've got?
Kevin March
Yes Stacy, we've talked about that. But there is no way for us to really point to some and demonstrate evidence that that's actually have occurring. Given the entire industry tends to price in dollars for the [indiscernible] of what’s being shipped, it does not allow us other alternatives it would seem for customers from the demand standpoint. But that's not to say that might not be a second order knock on affect like what you’re alluding to and we just don’t see any way that we can quantify that with any confidence.
Dave Pahl
And there are always pluses and minuses with currency movements, it's really impossible for us to quantify them.
Kevin March
Okay, thank you. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
We go now to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Given the timing when you start to see the weakness that you talked about in the March quarter and just given the softer than seasonal Q2 outlook, would you have to ratchet down your wafer manufacturing fab manufacturing activity or wafer structuring in Q2?
Dave Pahl
Harlan, yes, we'll be lightening up the wafer starts in 2Q. I would caution you though that pulling back on the wafer starts doesn’t necessarily mean that that will have a direct impact on our inventory. As the work in process in 1Q will become finished goods in 2Q, so we would expect our inventory to probably still go up a bit in 2Q, even though we pull back on wafer starts a little bit.
Harlan Sur
Okay, great, thanks for that. And then analog was up nicely 11% year-over-year, despite the headwinds and embedded was up only 2% which is a pretty significant deceleration year-over-year versus the prior quarter, I'm assuming that, the embedded weakness was primarily driven by DSPs, given the muted wireless infrastructure spending environment?
Dave Pahl
It's correct. It was impacted by the wireless infrastructure and in fact if you look at the businesses inside of embedded we had good growth in microcontrollers and connectivity both. But processors were down for the exact reason that you identified now. 
Okay, thank you, we'll go to next caller please.
Operator
We now go to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore
One other avenue to get of the broad based demand trends, are you seeing any sort of difference in demand patterns from your distributors, customers relative to the OEM customers, are they getting any more nervous or excited and willing to carry inventory and I realize the weeks of inventory data that you gave before but from a bookings perspective, any color will be helpful.
Dave Pahl
I think, I'll add just offer on that Ross, is that on year-over-year basis bookings were up by 5%. 60% of our revenue does go through [DSP], so clearly we're seeing one of the bookings coming to the [DSP] channel. The inventory levels are carrying over one and half weeks, just down about a week from a year ago, so they continue to carry lean levels of inventory. And I think largely that's because, they know that we carry Inventory and consignment and we also maintain very short lead times since we have for number of years now and so we get inventory quickly is pretty reliable for them when they order with us. So, I don't -- from those kinds of elements inside that space there is no rule again signs that we can looks at that says, there is demand destruction going on because of ROE, they really can’t [indiscernible] there.
Kevin March
And I have to add Ross that, if you look at our resale overall, that was very consistent with our combined analog and embedded sales. So they were in the upper single digits, very close to the same number. So you're following Ross?
Ross Seymore
Yeah a quick one, I just to make sure that I have all the moving parts, it sounds like in an answer to your prior question Kevin, you said OpEx will be upper little, you also said, sound like utilization will be down, it seems like putting that together with your earnings guidance, it implies gross margin is going to be down at bit sequentially, is that -- one, is that may directionally correct? Two, is the cause of the gross margin simply utilization or is there some mix effect that I also need to appreciate? Thanks.
Kevin March
You may be missing the mix effects inside there Ross; I don’t expect much change in the margin.
Dave Pahl
Okay, thank you for that question, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We go now to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
In the markets that you're seeing weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure, do you think -- is that an inventory or demand problem and I guess what is -- we seen other suppliers into the PC sector talk about return just sort of better in seasonal second half as you get past inventory correction, where do you stand on that?
Kevin March
Joe, I just say, first of all that the wireless infrastructure market is has been notoriously been very choppy as you look at demand over the number of years. So, there is usually a significant build is -- OEMs are planning to bid for the operators spend and then it typically surprises us and there is an overbuild that occurs, so one kind of begets the other.
We think that the wireless infrastructure market obviously long term is a good market for us and we've got a good position in and just as the numbers come down, they will come up again one day. On the PC side that's only a couple of percent of our revenue, so I don't think we really have any unique insight on that we believe that that weaknesses is due to the inventory that’s created because there wasn't as much demand in the XP refresh cycle, but really nothing beyond that and we’ll see how the rest of this quarter goes before we start making predictions on the back half, we’ll just take a one quarter at a time. So you have a follow on?
Joe Moore
Yeah and I guess specifically I think John, that you had mentioned the restricting that you did but just specifically you did cut back on R&D and macro based stations and I'm wondering if there is any anything directly that would point to that decision versus revenue seeing ours are completely separate from that.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Again I think that when we look at those markets they’re very long tailed in product cycles. We continue to make investments, they are just not at the same rates that we were making five and 10 years ago and that's not unlike what we've done in other markets as they’ve began to mature. So there is other areas of wireless infrastructure that looks like it will be very promising growth, like small cells and we continue to invest very -- at a very high levels there while we have very little revenue today so we would just believe that we've got to throttle that investment based on the opportunity overall. So, thanks for that question and will go to the next caller.
Operator
We go now to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy Arcuri 
I have two questions. I had a question about the channel, did you see any meaningful cancels this quarter and I had a follow up on the inventory?
Kevin March
No. We saw cancellations continue to run very-very low as we’ve seen for a number of quarters now and same is true of reschedules too by the way also very-very low. So no patterns indicating change of demand there.
Timothy Arcuri
Okay, great. And then Kevin you said inventory is going to be I think again you said in June despite loadings being down. I guess my question is, what do you think is sort of the -- now that you had a couple of quarters to think about the mix, when do you think is the right normalize level of inventory and do you think that we're going to come back down to that sort of that more normalized level during the back half of the year?
Kevin March
Yeah, Tim. We are going to use 2015 the really kind of monitor the effect of all the changes we've been doing with the portfolio and with our operations to model what we think is a more appropriate overall level of average inventories to carry. What we did conclude was that the prior model which had worked for us quite well of a 105 to 115 days was appropriate giving the mix that we had, but clearly as we moved to more and more consignment, as we move to keeping lead times of very short across the vast abundance of our portfolio, I think faced with that we got to carry more inventory than we have in the past.
And so we’ll be using 2015 to run various test on what the appropriate levels of inventories are to meet the service metrics that our customers have come to expect of us and then probably by the time we get to early next year when we do our capital management update we’ll go ahead and appoint a new model at that point in time.
Dave Pahl
Great. Tim, thank you and will go the next caller. Please?
Operator
We now go to Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit Shah
Yes. Thank you. Kevin and Dave. I just I wanted to clarify how these two segments that comprised 15% of revenue are driving what I estimated as a 500 basis point miss relative to seasonality. Are you guys just being conservative in anticipation of may be a fall out in some of your other end markets or and I just not fully incorporating other parts of the equation here?
Kevin March
So I will go ahead and just I think Dave attempted last time, I will give the try. There are several moving parts going on there when we look at 2Q and that compares on a year-over-year basis. So just the ROE alone impacts us about $50 million from a year-over-year compare for growth rate. Then you go beyond that and you've got continuing weakness and wireless infrastructure and PC's and you've also got the absence of the benefit the DLP had a year ago which was meaningful due to the World Cup and other large sporting events.
In fact we saw some of that impact of DLP already begin to occur in the first quarter, as we mentioned DLP was down quite a bit in first quarter. So you got those kinds of headwinds, ROE, wireless infrastructure, PC and DLP and then we've got the rest of the portfolio basically doing fine, because it’s simple with what we’re been seeing in the economies for the last few quarters.
Romit Shah
Thanks for the clarification Kevin I just wanted to ask you about M&A, there has been as you guys have seen a lot of activity over the last year and when I think about TI, M&A has certainly been part of your DNA over the last 10 to 15 years. Can you just talk about how you are thinking about M&A specifically in this environment relative to buying back your own stock?
Kevin March
Yeah our M&A posture haven’t changed at all. That meaning that most important thing is that to the extent that we considered an acquisition is got to be something that fits into our strategy that's consistent with our portfolio interest and something that we can generate long-term returns on therefore access free cash flow for our shareholders. If it kind of passes the strategy test then it's got to pass the numbers test.
And frankly we have a hard time with many of the companies that are out there today making those kind of numbers work. Contrast that to when we bought National back in 2011, at a time when all some [indiscernible] stock prices were considerably lower and you can certainly see in retrospect that was a very good return for our shareholders. So we tend to be very disciplined on that. We’ll continue to be disciplined on that. Buying back our own shares right now especially as long as they trade below the intrinsic value of the Company is that also it continues to be a good return for our shareholders especially from a free cash flow perspective.
Operator
We now go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Kevin, you've mentioned if you look at the portfolio, the rest of the business is doing fine outside of the factor that you've highlighted, if you go back to history and look at such a sharp destruction, just used that word, on the exchange rate when do you expect that to manifest itself in other parts of the business. So for instance the distributors in Europe and other pieces get that [indiscernible] go into for instance in industrial and autos, what does past currency issues tell us on that front? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Kevin March
Ambrish, I had some clever insight on that but I am afraid I don't, just from an experience standpoint, I actually do not recall that my experience in this capacity and I've been in this role for a very long time now, seeing currency drop this sharply in this short of period of time. So I have not history from which to trying to get a reference point to answer your question like that. I think we're just all going to have to wait and see where this takes us. I think the encouraging part is especially in industrial and automotive is that the silicon content going in those spaces continues to increase year-over-year and so despite ROE impacts, I don't think that’s going to slowdown the silicon content increases in those spaces. And frankly, if you look at the pricing of those and equipment’s, the cost of a $0.50 analog chip going into $0.55 is pretty irrelevant to an automotive customer I think. So if you look at the more macro effect and especially where we see growth someone out there in auto and industrial, it doesn't seem likely that we would see a sharp impact in demand caused just because of ROE. There may be other factors that may lead to that kind of difference.
Dave Pahl
And I'd just to add as many arguments putting pressure on the demand, there is as many arguments that it could help demand on the other side, so it's really tough to be able to quantify each of those into those impacts. Ambrish, you've got follow-up?
Ambrish Srivastava
And this is a clarification in response to Ross's question, Kevin, did you say gross margin will be flat and if so the way to think about it is that factory loading goes down in the non-300 millimeter and 300 millimeter is continuing to ramp so that offsets that lower factory loading?
Kevin March
That's a safe way to think about it, Ambrish. There is mix going on inside there but clearly we continue to ramp up 300 millimeter which is much more cost effective for us and so in balance we don’t' expect much change in margins.
Operator
We go now to Doug Freedman with RBC Capital.
Doug Freedman
Just to follow on that mixed shift that you're seeing, Kevin, can you possibly give us the utilization on your overall factory base and the utilization that you're seeing in 300 mil? And then I have a follow-up.
Kevin March
Doug, on the utilization, we typically would just talk about that as something drastic has occurred so I won’t go into that right now. I will remind that you on a capital management call, I did discuss for RFAB in particular that we have the majority of the equipment necessary to support the build-out of that factory to a $5 billion revenue level and that into 2014 we had achieved about $2 billion worth of build for revenues in support of that. So call that roughly 40% utilized, but at the same time we're also converting DMOS6 from its exclusive use by embedded processing to also be able to be used by analog, metal add another $3 billion of 300 millimeter analog capacity in DMOS6. So you could say in a sense that our utilization of 300 millimeter may actually decline, but that's not because of loading, that's because of increase in our capacity.
Doug Freedman
The question really that I have as my follow-up is when you look at the year-on-year growth, last year clearly you had a nice year but with the guidance you've just offered were actually down year-on-year. If we look at the long-term growth of your business, is there a point in time at which you might adjust what you think your long-term growth rate would be such that you felt factory consolidation would be part of the equation to drive higher efficiency?
Kevin March
No Doug, factory consolidation isn’t on our radar. What we're really interested in is very inexpensive factory acquisition with extremely low carrying cost that allows us to grow into it in a very efficient manner. As we've been talking about analog and a better processing combined for an extended period of time now, have been growing at about 9% compound annual growth rate. In fact even combined for this 1Q that we just closed out they grew another on 9% year-over-year. So they continue to grow quite healthy, I would expect that as we move forward in time we’ll look at those factories that provide us the best cost efficiency and cash flow delivery and keep those operating in load and those that probably going to be biased in our note age towards 300 millimeter.
Dave Pahl
And I just add to that if you look at the growth rates in time just look at what’s happened in second quarter, the overall numbers are very strong, I mean if you look at our gross margins, you look at where our OpEx levels are, our operating margins with that 9% analog and embedded processing growth this quarter we turned in 27% free cash flow. So, our financial performance isn’t predicated on having to hit a certain growth level we can do very well in a low growth environment or if things pick up we can, we are in a good position to build to support that as well. So thank you Doug and we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We’ll now go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis
Maybe just looking back to the weakness in the PC market, you clearly had a fairly seasonal December. And I don’t know if you saw any PC slowdown there, Intel sure didn’t. But then looks like you’ve figured correction in March. So, one, if you could -- I apologize if you already answered this. But within analog which your high performance and Silicon Valley is still up in March and really it was the PC dragging it down, if so would be down probably double-digit. Is that the right way to look at it? And then as you look to June, Intel is up, PC channel starting to turn around. Is it just that you’re working through some inventory or if there is there any way you can quantify that and then kind of just help me with the math as to when do you really start to see that?
Dave Pahl
Well, let me take a shot at it, and then I’ll let you ask a follow up. Some of that I think we’ve touched on. But again the weakness that we saw, Blayne, was really had manifested in March. And that was both in NPCs and in wireless infrastructure. Obviously, I don’t know how that played out at some of our competitors but we do expect to see that weakness in second quarter obviously our guidance is reflective of that. So, I don’t know if that helps or if there is part of that you’d like to ask a clarification or a follow up?
Blayne Curtis
Maybe I would ask -- obviously I can sign up for a full year forecast, so when you look at the businesses of PC in com, clearly they’ve been down for several quarters here or will be with the June guide, to get full year growth would require a substantial pick up in the second half. Do you see these as headwinds this year for you and if so how much?
Kevin March
Blayne, I’ll just take that. We’ll go ahead and forecast the balance of the year in front of each quarter when we get there. So we could just give you a guide, one quarter at a time. Obviously, I think you guys are probably better equipped than we are to come up with analysis to help figure out what the year might be and we’ll just leave it at that.
Dave Pahl
Okay, and that we are now out of time. So I’d like to thank you all for joining us today. And a replay of this call is available on our Web site. Good evening.

This concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Texas Instruments 4Q '14 and 2014 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings conference call. As usual Kevin March, TI's Chief Financial Officer is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our web at TI.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that's important to your calendar. We plan to hold a call on February 4, at 10:00 AM Central time to update our capital management strategy. Similar to what we've done for the last two years on this topic, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequently asked questions.
Turning to our earnings update, the fourth quarter marked another quarter of strong progress. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew again with combined revenue up 13% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.27 billion came in at the middle of the expected range that we communicated to you in October. Earnings per share were $0.76 and included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a $0.02 benefit from gains on sales of assets. Without these two items, our earnings would have been in the middle of our expected range.
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the year was $3.5 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30%. This is a 3 percentage point improvement from a year-ago period.
We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy which includes our growing 300 mm output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.
In the fourth quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago led by Power Management. High Volume Analog and Logic, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. This is the 6th quarter in a row of year-over-year growth for analog.
Embedded processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago, due to growth in processors, microcontrollers and connectivity, each of which increased by about the same amount. It is notable that connectivity grew at the fastest rate as we continue to see more products being connected. This is the 9th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for embedded processing. In our other segment, revenues declined 14% from a year ago, due to legacy wireless and custom ASIC products.
Turning to distribution, re-sales increased 14% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth of analog and embedded processing. Weeks of inventory decreased by a week from a year ago to a historically low level of just under 4.5 weeks.
This level has decreased over the past few years because we've structurally changed how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program. This quarter we continue to support more of our distribution sales from consignment inventory and now have about 60% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 15 percentage points from a year ago.
With this program, inventory sits on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when our distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that's stored at the distributor's location. We carry higher loads of inventory on TI's balance sheet with this program which has several benefits such as minimizing impact due to changes in distribution channel inventory and giving us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
Turning to our end markets, in 2014 industrial and automotive combined were 44% of TI's revenue up a couple of percentage points from last year. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue, automotive 13%, personal electronics 29%, communications equipment 17%, enterprise systems 6% and other 4%.
We continue to refine our understanding of our customers' end markets with better tools and software. On our website, we've included the last two years of updated market estimates and we've identified the sectors inside of each of those markets for your reference. Finally, let me make a few observations about the year overall. For 2014, analog and embedded processing revenue grew a combined 12% with analog up 13% and embedded up 12%. We gained market share in both businesses again in 2014.
These two key businesses were 83% of TI's revenue for the year up from 79% in 2013. Because they now make up more of our revenue, they are driving top line growth for the company. TI revenue overall grew 7% in 2014.
Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Dave and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.90 billion or 58% of revenue. Gross profit increased 16% from the year-ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory load-ins and an improved product portfolio focused on analog and embedded processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $740 million was down $67 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing and in Japan that were previously announced. That restructuring is now essentially complete and we achieved a little more than our estimated annualized savings.
Acquisition charges were $82 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $27 million benefit, due to gains on sales of assets. Operating profit was $1.10 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 60% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for analog was 38.7%. Operating margin for embedded processing was 17.0%, more than doubling from a year ago as we benefit from our investments for growth and as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing.
While this is solid progress, we still have work to do in this business. We expect embedded operating margins to continue to increase as our investments in R&D and SG&A will continue to drive top line growth while we hold these expenses flat. Net income in the fourth quarter was $825 million or $0.76 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement for the federal research tax credit and a benefit of $0.02 from the gains on sales of assets.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.27 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, slightly above our model range but a number that we are quite comfortable with. It is consistent with a growing portion of our product demands being supported with consignment inventory versus customer-owned inventory.
We believe these consignment arrangements give us better real-time feedback to end market demand that allow us to better manage our factories and maintain short lead times. We expect consignment inventory to continue to increase over the coming years, as distribution becomes a growing portion of our business. We will monitor the appropriateness of our current model of 105 to 115 days of inventory and possibly update this model in the next year or so.
Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. In 2014, cash flow from operations was $3.89 billion, up 15% from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $385 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the year was $3.50 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 18% higher than a year ago. As we've said, we believe free cash flow growth especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or protectively reinvested in the business. As we've noted our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we receive from exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $698 million of our stock, for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned in 2014 was $4.15 billion which is 3% higher than the prior year. Outstanding share count was reduced by 3.3% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash in our cash management, our tax practices. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.54 billion of cash and short term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.18 billion up 11% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil. Acquisition charges which are non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 is about 30% and this is the tax rate you should use for the first quarter and for the year. The rate is higher than the last year because of an expected increase in profits and does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
In summary, the fourth quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in analog and embedded processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel. The result is a diverse and long-lived positions in many markets.
We remain intent on excellence in execution, being disciplined in allocating our capital and our firm belief that free cash flow per share is the best long term indicator of shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Vicki, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Vicki?

[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Chris Danely with Citi.
Chris Danely
Kevin, I guess if you had to characterize the overall environment now versus say a quarter ago or a year ago would you say broadly speaking not much has changed we're still in this fine roughly seasonal environment? Or have you seen any changes in visibility or your overall business?
Kevin March
No, Chris, I think you said it. While it probably hasn't really changed all that much there was a slight change in our book-to-bill on a year-over-year basis. This quarter was about 0.97. A year ago quarter was 0.94, but frankly because more and more of our orders are coming in on consignment I think book-to-bill means less and less about a particular of where our revenue is going. So I think that to summarize our sense, it's more steady as she goes just like we've seen for the last few years of an economy just growing along on a steady basis and we're trying to take advantage of growing a little bit faster than that.
Dave Pahl
Yes, and Chris, let me add, just, the other things that we see. If you look at our inventory, it's at a healthy level. Our channel inventories are actually down a week, as I said earlier, from a year ago, just under 4.5 weeks. Our lead times remain consistent, our cancellations and reschedules remain very, very low and in addition, we continue to deliver our products on time for customers. So those types of things are always a good indication for the overall environment too. Do you have a follow-up?
Chris Danely
Yes. So it sounds like things are pretty normal, seasonal this year. Can you give us any sense of the relative growth rates of your major product lines this year? What you're expecting between analog, embedded and the other stuff?
Dave Pahl
No, we don't try to forecast out a year on the major product lines or even at the company level. I will point out that both of those product lines turned in another year of market share gains and certainly, we're working really hard to do that for another year and we'll just have to see how the year turns out.
Operator
We will go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.
Ambrish Srivastava
On the inventory front, are we to assume now that your visibility now, vis-a-vis in the past is higher also, because of a higher percentage is consignment off the disti? And within that, that gives you better visibility? Is that the right way to think about it? So the days are going up versus what your targeted range is and really not comparable to if we look at the last 5 year and 10 year median. And then I had a quick follow up.
Kevin March
Ambrish, I don't know that I would necessarily go to improved visibility, but we do get I would say a much more improved or real-time feedback from what's actually going on with true end demand for our products and the real benefit of that is that we can adjust our factories on a real-time basis whereas as you point out, if you went back a number of years, we carried far fewer days of inventory.
But the signal as to how fast our products are actually being consumed in the end market also took a lot longer to get to us and so we'd respond later. Now, we can respond much more quickly. So it's less a question of improved visibility as it is a question of much more real-time feedback as to just how fast our products are being consumed.
Ambrish Srivastava
Okay, thanks for the clarification, Kevin, that's what I meant because we always get into this debate in end cycles about sell-in and sell-through. My quick question is, what should we be modeling for CapEx for this year? Thank you.
Kevin March
Yes. I would continue to recommend that you assume that we will average about 4% of our revenues on CapEx on average, over multi-year periods. Some years might be a little lighter like it was this past year where we came in at about 3% in 2014, but on average, we expect 4% and that's how we build our own internal models.
Operator
Next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Kevin, 90 days ago, when you were talking about OpEx for the December quarter you said that looking back a year-ago and how it flowed a year ago was probably a good model and you even mentioned that it would probably be a good model going into the calendar first quarter. Is that statement still hold? Or can you help us understand the puts and takes on OpEx going into the March quarter especially around some seasonal costs?
Kevin March
Yes, John, you're exactly right. So going from fourth quarter to first quarter, the best way to model that is to take a look -- really, the last year is a good starting point. We typically are up in the mid-single digits from fourth to first on OpEx and that's because of the absence of the holiday periods that we have in the fourth quarter and the annual startup of pay and benefit increases that we have in first quarter.
This year we might be up just a little bit more than that versus a year ago simply because on higher profitability that we are expecting for the year, we also expect higher variable compensation accruals and so that may take our fourth to first up a little bit higher than what you saw about a year ago.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer
Yes, I do. Just going back to the analog space, Dave, maybe you can give us a little bit more color because it's pretty impressive. You guys put up double-digit growth year-over-year this quarter, against pretty hard compares from the year-ago quarter. So I'm just kind of curious to what extent do you think your market share gains could be accelerating around your consignment efforts? Or if you could just help me understand a little bit better? I know you talked about power leading the way this quarter. Can you help me understand a little bit more why the growth seems to be doing much better than some of your peers?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think when you look year-over-year first of all, it's good to have all four of those businesses contributing to the growth. Certainly, power is benefiting from just a secular trend of things wanting to run more off of batteries and things that do get plugged in becoming more efficient. We also have a very strong product line there too. So I think that those things are helping us to gain share. We've talked about for some time, that it's not one thing inside of a business like analog or embedded processing that allows you to gain share. There is a lot of things that you have to do to be a good analog company and we've got a lot of competitors that fit that category, but we've got other things, like the scale of our -- and reach of our sales force, our presence on the web, our manufacturing footprint, the technology that we bring to bear and the breath of the product portfolio. I think it's just all those things working together.
Kevin March
I would probably add one more thing there too, is our strategy of -- that we've discussed for a couple years now of buying our capacity ahead of our needs and always have an ample capacity, quite frankly gives our customers, new and old, increased confidence that we have adequate capacity to meet their demand requirements and they see us consistently maintaining short lead times. So that's just another element that helps us be able to win market share versus some of the other competitors that we're up against.
Operator
We will go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution. Thank you for taking us to the OpEx step-up here in Q1. Now with most of the embedded in Japan restructuring behind you, continued discipline on the team's part, how should we think about the OpEx trends beyond the first quarter? I think Kevin, I heard you mention your embedded OpEx kind of holding flattish, but how should we think about the overall business beyond Q1?
Kevin March
So Harlan, I think the best way to think about that is we discussed -- I think it was back in 2011 that on average, we would expect our OpEx to run between 20% and 30% of revenues. So like in a weak market, it might be at the 30% level and in stronger markets it would be in the 20% level. We're performing quite well in our markets right now and so you're seeing that OpEx come down. In fact, most recently in the second half of 2014 we were running around 23% of revenue and so I would say that you would want to model us in the lower half of that range, as you try to think about how much our OpEx spend will be in 2015.
Dave Pahl
Great. You have a follow-on, Harlan?
Harlan Surveillance
Yes. Thank you for that. Your thoughts, directionally on utilization levels here in Q1? Given the seasonality in your business, I would assume that it's down again given the book-to-bill ratio and the revenue guidance for Q1. Is that also how we should think directionally about gross margins, as well?
Kevin March
I think the way you need to think about utilization is first by definition because we buy capacity ahead of time, we will by definition be operating in an underutilized environment versus our maximum capacity -- theoretical capacity. But that aside, because of manufacturing cycle times, the material that we're starting in the first quarter, especially as we move into the second month of the first quarter, really is destined for second quarter shipments.
So your utilization tends to proceed the quarter you're moving into as to what your expectations are and as the second quarter for the last 3, 4, 5 years now and normally for us is a growth quarter compared to the first quarter, we will adjust our factory loadings accordingly to our expectation to second quarter revenue expectations.
Operator
We will go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon
I think to follow up on that gross margin question, it looks to me your implied guidance for margins is maybe 57, maybe a little higher, so low 57, it's down a little bit on revenues that are down slightly with inventories a little higher. Could you just give us some feeling of -- if you don't want to give numbers, at least some of the drivers for gross margins into Q1? And in particular, what are you planning to do with the inventory on your own balance sheet? How will that trend?
Kevin March
Yes. I don't know that I necessarily have -- don't want to get into the GPM per se. Let me just talk a little bit more about what our inventory levels might look like and how that might drive us. We don't have an inventory forecast, per se, but given the growth in consignment and the typically seasonally strong 2Q, we would expect our factory loadings to increase as we move through the quarter as I mentioned a moment ago.
One of the things to keep in mind, when you adjust your faculty loadings, if your quarterly loadings are really for the following quarter's expectations then if you think about the pattern of movement through the quarter you take your loadings. Coming into fourth quarter, our loadings would be dropping coming into the quarter and going into first quarter, our loadings would start to increase during the quarter. And so you're always going to have a bit of a lag, when you try to track the GPM that follows with that which I think is what you are asking for there, Stacy.
I think more importantly, what we see going forward is that our margins we expect to continue to improve along with our free cash flow. By virtue of the fact that analog and embedded processing continue to become a larger portion of our total revenues and by virtue of the fact that 300 mm manufacturing continues to be a larger portion of our total production, as we go forward and both of those result in both higher margins and higher free cash flow.
Stacy Rasgon
For my follow up, just to touch on the tax rate. So your guidance for next year, 30%, a little higher than your guidance for 2014 was which I think was 28%. I just wanted to verify, is the only real source of that just the higher profit versus expectation? I think you had told us before to tax every incremental dollar of profit around at the incremental tax rate, 35%.
Kevin March
Yes. Stacy, that's correct. In fact, our tax rate in 2014, our guidance was as you said, they rounded down to 28%. It actually came in just a little bit higher than that, if it weren't for the R&D credit and so we're looking at it rounding up to 30%, as we move into 2015. So you're exactly right. As you model what you would expect our earnings and fall-through to be, you should tax that at approximately 35% Delta profit as it comes through during the year.
Dave Pahl
And I'll just point out too Stacy, that that does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit that we got for 2014.
Kevin March
Yes. If that does reinstate, that would be between 1 and 2 points of tax benefit.
Operator
We will go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya
Actually, when I look at your Q4 results versus consensus estimates, you did better in your core analog and embedded segments. But there was some shortfall in the other sales which are actually down 6% year-on-year. I think they were down almost 11% last year and I believe you mentioned some loss of ASIC business. I'm wondering, what is the right way Kevin or Dave to model this segment? Because it is a very profitable segment for you. It is still a decent size segment and I think in the past, you have mentioned that it could be flattish, plus/minus 2% or so. So just conceptually, what is the right way to model the segment?
Dave Pahl
Yes. If you look back at the other segment, the first thing I would point out is, it has a calculated revenue and the seasonally strong back-to-school season happened, but in second and third quarter. So those tend to be the seasonally strongest quarter. Third to fourth, that biggest transition sequentially, of course is due to the change of that business. If you look overall, you can look at the components that fit inside of other. The first is DLP and I described that as a more steady business and one that might have some -- we've described as wild cards of new opportunities.
The vast majority of that business is in front projectors today, as well as in cinema and we've got some -- what we call pico projectors or small form factor projectors that make up the revenue. But there is some opportunities inside of automotive and other embedded opportunities that could provide growth in the future. The next biggest piece of that revenue is calculators and that business has been, I would say flat maybe slightly down over time.
And then royalties have run steady about $40 million to $50 million a quarter and that's probably a good thing to look and then we will have ASIC business that will transition over to EP over time. That is some business that's in communications infrastructure and we believe that that will move over. So you net all that stuff together and we think that the other segment will be flat, maybe up or down 1 percentage point, as we've described in the past.
Kevin March
And I think Vivek, you also asked about year-over-year. Just recall that last year still had about $55 million or so of wireless revenue it in that this year is essentially zero. So that's your biggest decline on a year-over-year basis.
Vivek Arya
Yes. So as my follow-on, back to your core business, do you think you have the right scale in your embedded business to take op margins into the 20s? So when I look at the three areas within that business; processors, connectivity, microcontrollers, how would you rank TI against the best competitor in that segment? And really, I'm trying to understand how you can grow that segment, gain share, improve margins while keeping investments flattish, while all your competitors are all investing in their respective businesses. Thank you.
Kevin March
Vivek, I'll leave it to you to analyze the competitors. I'll speak to how TI is doing. You may recall back in late 2010 early 2011 timeframe, we significantly stepped up our investments in that particular segment in order to accelerate our product introductions and therefore begin to accelerate our revenue growth and if you take a look at what's happened over the last, as Dave mentioned in his opening remarks, nine quarters of sequential or continuous year-over-year growth that strategy has paid off. So those products are really beginning to take.
And as you know, those kinds of products tend to have very long shelf lives, so we expect to see more of the same on that. Now while we took spending down this past year as a result of the restructuring actions we announced this time a year ago, we didn't eliminate them. The amount that we are investing is still quite high and that's why the operating profit is still not quite where we think entitlement will take us to. So we continue to invest at quite a healthy level, just not at the level that you saw us invest in in the prior few years.
So those combined, the high levels of investment, an expanding product portfolio from heavier levels of investment in the prior few years, have all given us very strong growth in that segment and will continue to give us growth and quite frankly based upon some of the best in class performance that you can look at out there, we have -- shall we say, expectations similar to at least as well as those companies are operating.
Dave Pahl
Yes and I would also add, Vivek if you look at our product portfolio like inside of microcontrollers, we've got two architectures there where we'll introduce new products with new interfaces and meet new standards, inside of that. A lot of our competitors will have half a dozen or a dozen, different architectures where they've got to spread their R&D investment over. So we can be very efficient with that.
And in addition if you remember, as part of the wireless restructuring, we brought over those connectivity products that really already had a pretty significant investment in those wireless technologies. So we're supporting nearly a dozen different wireless standards today and that group is really focused on growing the top line rather than having to develop baseline technologies.
Operator
We will go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello
A lot of great questions asked already. My one question is just around the long term segment goals that you might have. Auto is kind of low double digits, personal electronic is almost 30%, although that's coming down. Is the goal really from a segment diversification standpoint, to continue to increase in particular that auto sub-category and decrease the personal electronics category say, over the next two or three years?
Kevin March
Yes Jim. Our goal is not necessarily to try to optimize that mix, per se. I would say that, if you look inside of personal electronics as an example, we'll look for places where we can find sustainable revenue with a differentiated position. And if you look at some of our largest customers that we sell products into, we'll sell several hundred devices into those customers and those products could be anywhere from $0.75 down to $0.05 and oftentimes, they may have lives that live from one generation of a product to another.
So those are the types of opportunities that we try to look for in a space like Comms Equipment. Now certainly, from an incremental investment profile, if we had an extra $1 to spend and we had an opportunity to spend that in either industrial or automotive those products in general just tend to have longer life cycles and better characteristics. So that may see an increase in investment. And then lastly, I would just add that those two markets I think have the secular trends that you are well aware of. So we'll benefit from that as the rest of the industry will and of course, we hope to benefit disproportionately from those investments.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
Jim Covello
Yes. I guess I'll stick on that topic. So personal electronics has been coming down, but your view would be it's not really a function of an intentional effort on the part of Texas Instruments. It's just more a function of the other businesses that you have or just happen to be better long term growth areas and it's naturally coming down. Is that the right characterization?
Dave Pahl
And even more specific than that I think if you backed out legacy wireless, you'll see that it's actually been fairly stable, as a mix. So that change in percentage is more driven by the strategic decision to exit that one portion of the business.
Operator
We will go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
I also wanted to ask about the end market breakdown that you guys provide. If I look at where you were a year ago, and there was probably some reclassification, but it looked like industrial went from 24% in 2013 to 31% in 2014 and personal assistance from 37% to 29%. Those swings seem dramatic. I just wanted to see if there was some change in the way you were looking at the breakdown?
Dave Pahl
Yes, Joe. We continued to refine our understanding of our customers and markets and we've got better tools and software. So if you go out to our web now, you'll actually see two years of history that we have out there, as well as the identified sectors that those markets made up.
Operator
We will go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig Ellis
Kevin, just to follow up to Vivek's discussion on embedded processing and expense control, it's really the flip side of that. Can you talk a little bit about what you're looking at before you would start to invest more in the business? It's clear you want higher operating margins than you have now but what are the things that TI is looking at before it will commit to incremental investment in that business?
Kevin March
Yes Craig, I would say we're probably quite a ways off before we even have to entertain a question like that. Our focus for the next few years is managing the total spend inside that business and driving top line growth and frankly, if we begin to see top line growth then begin to net the kind of bottom-line results that we can see happening in other players in that space, at that point in time we might entertain increasing our spending but not until then.
Craig Ellis
And then the follow-up is really taking another swing at something that Chris brought up which is longer-term growth on a segment basis. At least in my model, calendar '14 was the first year in the last four or five where embedded processing and analog had similar growth rates and they were both double digits. Just philosophically, as you look at those two businesses which have had very different histories, are there reasons why they should have materially different growth rates going forward? Or given that they are both closer to operating on more optimal levels, should they be fairly similar?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think when you begin to look longer term at the growth rate and the potentials of those businesses, I would start with what do you believe the semiconductor market will grow on. We have held the position that we think that the semiconductor market roughly grows at twice the rate of GDP. There is some that will violently agree with this and some that will violently disagree with that basic assumption. But whatever that assumption is, we think both analog and Embedded Processing are big enough portions of the market that they will grow in-line with that.
If you look at those businesses certainly over the last five years, they both have continued to gain share and we believe that we're continuing to invest and we've got a lot of room to gain share. And in fact, in analog we've got 18.3% market share and inside of Embedded Processing, we've got around 15 percentage points. So lots of headroom to do that and we've gained probably 30, 40, sometimes more than that in market share on a given year. We still have to have everyone report before all the final numbers are in but we're confident that we'll gain share again this year. So Kevin, do you have anything to add to that?
Kevin March
Yes. Craig, one thing I would recommend you maybe take a look at. If you do look at those two segments, analog and embedded processing, their quarterly growth rates I think that was the point you were making. They can vary quite markedly from one another. If you look at the two of them on a year-over-year basis, they actually are much more correlated than you might expect. They're both gaining share as Dave was mentioning and are both growing quite nicely on a year-over-year basis. So if you do some measurements for those two segments on year-over-year growth rates and compare that back over the last half dozen quarters or so, I think you might be pleasantly surprised to see they grow pretty similarly to each other.
Operator
We will go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis
Kevin, as you go into your capital management conference call next week, could you just remind us what your historical philosophy has been on levering the balance sheet to drive shareholder value?
Kevin March
Well Mark, what we've talked about on debt that -- we have debt on the balance sheet today. It will be there until 2023 because that is when the last of the current outstanding bonds matures and our attitude towards debt is that it will continue to be part of the balance sheet when the economics make sense and for us, that economics making sense means that if we can borrow at interest rates that we perceive to be below what we expect our inflation rates to be or correspondingly at less than our dividend yield, then we think that's probably a pretty good deal on behalf of our shareholders and so that will be the kind of parameters that we look at, as we continue to decide how much debt to carry on the balance sheet and as bonds mature going forward. We do actually have a $1 billion of debt maturing in 2015. We have $250 million maturing in April and $750 million maturing in August of 2015.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-on, Mark?
Mark Lipacis
Yes. Thank you for that color. So the analog business operating margins are about 2000 basis points higher than the embedded. As we think about the potential profitability of the embedded business, are there structural reasons why embedded profitability could not equal the analog profitability longer-term? Thank you.
Kevin March
Mark, I think the simple answer in my mind is it's difficult for us to find evidence of somebody in the marketplace outside of TI, who has been able to perform at those kind of levels. I think the economics are such that it'll be very attractive. It's going to be a great place for us to be in, but it probably doesn't quite get up to par of what you see in analog. I think analog is quite unique in what it can produce for companies and for shareholders who all own those companies like we do.
Operator
We will go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy Arcuri
Just a question again on gross margin and what the possible headroom is, I guess if you look at the embedded business, you're up to 17%, but if you look at some of the well-run peers in that space, they're doing sort of mid-20s. So maybe ask a little bit different way, is there any reason why you can't get the embedded margins up to the mid-20s?
Kevin March
No. There is no reason why we can't do that.
Dave Pahl
Yes. We've made good progress. Obviously, Tim, we still have work to do, but we believe that we can get into that range with revenue growth and so that's what we're planning to do. They've got a good start. You've nine quarters in a row of year-on-year growth and are making progress towards moving that operating margin higher. Do you have a follow-on?
Timothy Arcuri
Okay. I do, yes. And then just relative to the inventory, certainly some of it is structural as you indicated, but is any of the rise in inventory related to your perception that June could be a little bit better than seasonal quarter?
Kevin March
Tim, I would say that it's probably too early for us to call the entire second quarter. Right now, we're focused on first quarter. So the inventory that we've got staged today is designed to support our first quarter needs and then as we adjust our factory loadings in first quarter, that inventory that we build will be designed to deal with our second quarter needs. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect we will be ramping up our factories as we go through first quarter in support of second quarter and when we get to the end of the quarter we will find out how much inventory we're holding at that point in time.
Operator
We will go to our last question from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman
I guess if I could dig deep into some of the results that you've reported and maybe some of the outlook that you might have by key markets out there. I think investors are interested to hear what you're seeing in the PC and server power markets as well as maybe the disk drive markets. And if you could offer some color on what you're seeing in the communications market as well? I think those are -- maybe not that overly material to the TI story, but they are to investors in general.
Dave Pahl
Okay, Doug, let me share some end market trends that we've seen. I think that that may address some of those issues, maybe not down at the level that you are quite asking. So I think you were talking about PCs and those would fall into our personal electronics products. On a year-on-year basis, they were up, despite the declines that Kevin had mentioned earlier in legacy wireless and that growth was led by mobile phones. If you look at industrial and I want to point out, when we talk about industrial we've been very intentional about how to measure that and it's different than when investors talk about the industrial market.
And the sectors, we've got a dozen sectors that make up industrial and they include things like factory automation and control, medical, healthcare, fitness, building automation, smart grid, motor drives, displays those types of things, the full list is out on our website. And we've seen that was up led by medical and healthcare fitness. Appliance, factory automation and smart grid were also up from a year ago. Comms equipment was up due to wireless infrastructure and then enterprise systems were up, primarily due to projectors. So with that, you have a follow-on?
Doug Freedman
Yes, I guess for my follow-on, just what are you seeing in terms of any shift in the competitive landscape? I know investors are somewhat concerned over what we're seeing in China from an investment standpoint. Is there anything in your markets that you're seeing that would point to any change in the competitive landscape?
Kevin March
Doug, as it relates to China in particular, because you've mentioned that there we've been in China for a very long time now. We have I think over a dozen sales and R&D sites there. We have both a wafer fabrication facility and an assembly test site there. In addition, we have thousands of customers buying thousands of parts and consequently, we've become a very important supplier to a large number of Chinese companies across a very diverse set of markets.
So we see China as continuing to be a great opportunity for TI regardless of any of the competitive environments out there and our goal is to operate in China just like we do in the rest of the world which is to make ourselves an integral part of their success and an indispensable supplier and we've got a great shall I say, a long way -- we're a long way into that already and we feel pretty good about our position.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Great. Thanks for that question, Doug and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again on our February 4 Capital Management Call. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments' Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
Dave Pahl
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin Marks, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliation on our website at TI.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for more complete description.
The third quarter was another quarter that marked strong progress. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew again with combined revenue of 10% from a year ago.
Revenue of $3.5 billion came in solidly in the upper half of our expected range we had communicated to you in July. Earnings per share of $0.76 was at the top of our range as profitability was strong in the quarter.
Our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We continue to believe that free cash flow growth is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term, especially on a per share basis.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month was almost $3.5 billion, or 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 300 basis point improvement from a year ago period.
We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy which includes our growing 300 millimeter output and purchasing assets ahead of demand at the stressed prices.
We also continue to believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the business. Over the past 12 months we've returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends paid.
In the third quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago led by power management. High volume analog and logic, high performance analog, and Silicon Valley analog also grew.
Embedded processing grew 6% from a year ago due to microcontrollers, connectivity and processors each of which grew by about the same amount. Embedded processing delivered its eighth quarter in a row of year-on-year growth.
In our other segment, revenue was about even from a year ago as a decline in legacy wireless products was mostly offset by growth in DLP products.
Turning to distribution, resales increased 10% from a year ago consistent with our combined revenue growth in analog and embedded processing. Weeks of inventory were unchanged at a historically low level of just over four and a half weeks. This level was low because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program.
This quarter we continue to convert more of our distribution sales to consignment and now support about 55% of our distribution revenue on consignment up about 10 percentage points from a year ago.
With this program, inventory sits on TI's of balance sheet and revenues recognized from distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that is stored at the distributors' locations. This program minimizes changes in demand due to distribution inventory -- channel inventory and most importantly, allows us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
From an end market perspective, TI revenue growth from a year ago was due to communications equipment, industrial and automotive, each of which grew by about the same amount. Enterprise systems was also up while revenue and personal electronics declined due to legacy wireless products.
Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin?
Kevin March
Thanks Dave and good afternoon everyone.
Gross profit in the quarter was $2.04 billion or 58.4% of revenue. Gross profit increased 15% from the year ago quarter and gross profit margin hit another new record. This gross profit reflects higher revenue and an improved product portfolio focused on analog and embedded processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $795 million was down $38 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in embedded processing in Japan that were previously announced as well as continued cost discipline across TI.
Acquisition charges were $83 million almost all of which were the ongoing amortization intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were $9 million benefit primarily due to gains from sales of assets.
Operating profit was $1.18 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $826 million or $0.76 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.38 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 108 consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $103 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.82 billion, up 17% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month the capital expenditures were $367 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue. 
Besides inexpensively adding capacity ahead of demand, we have focused on delivering higher levels of customer service. By combining this capacity with continued improvement and how we manage inventory, we're able to keep our lead-times consistently low while continuing to deliver on time.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.45 billion or 27% of revenue. As we've said, we believe strong cash flow growth particularly free cash flow growth as most important to maximize shareholder value in the long-term that will be valued only if its return to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business.
In the third order, TI paid $319 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock for a total return of $989 million. As we've noted, our intent is to return all of our free cash flow plus any proceeds that we received from the exercise of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
Total cash return in the past 12 months was $4.16 billion which was 9% higher than a year ago. In the quarter, we announced a 13% dividend increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.30 to $0.34 per share or $1.36 annualized. This marked our 11th consecutive year of increasing dividends and our 52nd year of continuous dividend payments.
Outstanding share count has reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter with $3.19 billion of cash and short-term investments up from $2.80 billion at the beginning of the quarter.
TI's U.S. entities own 81% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.34 billion, up 6% from a year ago and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.95.
This ratio would have been a bit higher except for the effect of the conversion to consignment of some products sold at distribution. While book-to-bill still would have been below one, this is consistent with the pattern that we're seeing for the past four years.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.13 billion to $3.39 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 8% from a year ago.
We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil. Acquisition charges which are non-cash amortization charges will remain about even and hold at about $89 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years.
Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter.
In summary the third quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in analog and embedded processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel.
The result is diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, disciplined in allocating our capital, and firm believers that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of shareholder value.
With that let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thanks Kevin. Operator you can open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for additional follow-up. Danny?
"
2014-10-20,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions)
Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kevin I guess my first question will be on OpEx. Clearly you are well ahead of sort of your expected annualized savings of $130 million with the restructuring actions. How do think OpEx will trend sequentially into the December quarter? And if you look at R&D as a percent of rev now below 10%, is that just a structural change in the model and how worried should I be at what scale level you should be investing on R&D for future growth?
I understand that you are still spending absolutely a lot more money than most of your peers, but tough to see someone with your gross margins and R&D as a percent below 10%.
Kevin March
Okay, John a think there were a couple in there so let me see if I can remember them all. Starting with OpEx and trends, the -- clearly OpEx was down quarter-over-quarter largely as a result of some of the restructuring actions we previously announced as well as just ongoing cost discipline in all the various businesses across TI.
As you look into fourth quarter, if you just go back and take a look at a year ago that's probably your best gauge to take a look at the fourth quarter and even first quarter for that matter.
We typically see that OpEx is lower in the fourth quarter due to holidays and vacations. In addition this fourth quarter, we expect a further benefit of another $15 million of cost to come out as a result of the restructuring that we announced on the embedded processing that's part of that $130 million of annualized savings that you were mentioning John.
In fact we're probably running ahead of that $130 million of annualized savings right now. We're probably come up to beyond that. From the total R&D spend, as a percent of revenue, again, I think what's more important is not how much you spent, but how well you spent it. And I think the best indicator and how well you are spending is what's happening to your market share as a result of the products we're introducing into the market.
In our case, if you take a look at 2006 through 2013, the last full year periods that we reported on, our total R&D spend is up 77% over that period. But most importantly, that R&D is a result in products where we have continually gained share. So, again I think John its less a question of how much you spend and a lot more how well you spend it and spend it on things that customers really carry about.
Dave Pahl
Good. John you have a follow-up?
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yeah. Guys quickly just I know you don't give segment guidance or revenue, when I look at the embedded business in the September quarter, it was up only about 1.1% sequentially which is little bit weaker than I had been modeling and I'm kind of curious as to what you think might have driven that?
And given that some of your peers have talked about sort of slowdown in the second half of September from a macro perspective, did any of that play into the embedded business in the September quarter? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Okay. So let me take that, John. I think if you look at the growth rates between analog and embedded processing, you can see a lot of quarters they won't grow the same. And I think if you look at -- both of those businesses they have different end market exposures and really it's those end market exposures that will explain most of the differences in those numbers.
So -- and the second part of our question was, yeah, just -- did -- basically the overall environment impacting the growth that we've seen there and I’d just say, no, that really isn’t in those numbers. Basically that forecast is given off of the orders that we received from our customers. So thank you John. Can we go to the next caller please?
Operator
Yes sir. Our next caller is Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Hi, thank you very much. Just on the overall demand environment. There is a lot of confusion out there, but it seems like things have slowed down, so just wanted your perspective. In the past you guys have given us certain things as you look at such as cancellations and so on and so forth.
And also within that frame of reference, Dave, if you could please just walk us through your disti consignment versus non-consignment? And then how would you compare to somebody who claims that they are sell-through so they see a slowdown before -- a quarter or so before others. And then I had a very quick follow-up.
Dave Pahl
Okay, so a couple of points in there Ambrish. The first is that, I just point out that all of our distributors provide us with a point-of-sale reporting and we get that information on a very regular basis. So regardless of how the revenue is recognized we see what's going on from a distributor resale standpoint.
The second thing, you touched on the current environment, and we really want to be guarded on trying to take a position for the industry on where that’s going. But we can really point to just what we see. 
If I kind of step through those, our inventory on our books is at 108 days is within our target model. If you look at our channel inventories, those were essentially unchanged from last quarter. They are at a very lean level, at just over 4.5 weeks. Our lead-times have been consistent and I would say low. Our cancellations and reschedules remain very low, so nothing changing on that front.
And then probably as we have grown over these last few quarters we've been able to support that growth and keep delivering our products on time at very, very high service levels. So, our operations continue to execute at that high level.
So -- and then I will get to the last part of your question was what percentage of our revenue goes through distribution and what percentage is supported by consignment. So, the first one is, about 55% of our revenues go through the distribution channel and about 55% of that is supported on consignment.
And as we pointed out in our prepared remarks that has increased by about 10% from year ago as we've had a couple of conversions go on this year. And I would say that we are not done with that. We actually expect that additional conversions will happen and -- over the next year or so, so we expect that percentage will actually increase. So Ambrish you have follow-up?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets
Yeah, a quick follow-up, Dave, on the embedded operating margins you guys have had a steady increase, what's the right way to think about how do you get to North of 20%? Is it just a matter of focusing on the right product mix and getting that ramped up or is it something beyond that. Thank you, Dave. 
Dave Pahl
Sure.
Kevin March
Yeah, Ambrish. I will take that one. On embedded processing there our margins have been continuously improving over these last few quarters and we would expect further improvement. Recall, I just mentioned earlier in the call that we would expect another $15 million or so of cost to come out of fourth quarter and most of that will come out of embedded processing.
I would add that, from this point going forward, and we've talked about this last couple of quarters, the amount of spend inside embedded processing is sufficient. It doesn’t need to increase anymore. What really the focus is revenue growth and that’s what this is really about. And that entire team has been very focused on that.
I believe they just recorded their eight quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue growth, so they clearly are working on the right metrics to really make that business start to deliver profitability at the level we expected to at TI.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Ambrish. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I want to dig into the embedded processor margins again just a little bit. You had about $26 million in OpEx come out from Q2 to Q3. You had revenue in the Group, up a little bit or mostly flat. Margins were only up a little bit.
Given all of that cost in theory I would have expected to come out of embedded processing, why weren’t the embedded processing margins up more. It doesn’t seem like all of those cost savings actually flowed through the margins this quarter.
Kevin March
Actually they all flowed through the margins, Stacy, but not all through embedded processing. Recall, those actions incorporate both embedded processing as well as actions in Japan, which drove margins as well.
Even with that at the EP level you did see about a 72% fall through on that delta revenue. So you're seeing it come through, but do keep in mind that Japan start spreading on some of the other businesses as well.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Got it, got it. That’s helpful. So my follow-up, if I can dig into the gross margins little bit, I think both for this quarter and next quarter. So for this quarter you came in a little bit high, I guess, was that only the revenue upside or was there something else in terms of mix or other cost savings that push it up.
And then for next quarter depending on how far you are guiding OpEx down, it feels to me like you are guiding gross margins implicitly flat to up in Q4 and quarter of revenues are down and typically your gross margins will be down in Q4 as well.
So if you could give us any sort of feeling for what the gross drivers for next quarter ought to be in terms of mix offsetting revenue declines that would be very helpful.
Kevin March
Sure, Stacy. I think that, clearly, the extra revenue came through and it was quite rich. We also had a slightly better mix of overall products that were shipped in the quarter. That combined gave us that new record gross profit margin of 58.4%.
As we look into fourth quarter, I would not characterize our guidance suggesting that margins go up. We will be reducing loading some in the fourth quarter on a seasonal basis. Hence you can expect that margins will be down a bit, not very much, but down just a little bit.
So depending on how you're building your model there I wouldn’t assume margins increase in fourth quarter. 
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein
Got it. 
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Thank you Stacy and we will go to the next caller.
Operator
Our next caller is Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.
Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the solid quarterly execution. The markets have been focused on Europe and China as sources of potential weakness. At the same time the team has done a solid job on diversification and maybe that’s what it is, the diversity of forging a more stable revenue profile.
But at the margin, can you just talk about the overall health by geographies. Have you seen any signs of weakening above the normal seasonal trends that you would normally expect during Q3 or Q4?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, sure Harlan. I would say if you just look at what happened regionally, year-over-year Asia and Europe were both up while the U.S. was even and Japan was down a little bit. And sequentially all the regions were up with Asia and Europe up the most. 
And if you look specifically inside of China and how resales had done there, we had looked into that. And I'd just say that resales really just continued to be solid as we closed out the quarter. So that’s basically what we saw. You have a follow-up?
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Securities, Inc.
Yes, absolutely. Thank you for that. You gave us some trends in OpEx into the fourth quarter. How should we think about OpEx as we move into the first half of next year?
Kevin March
Harlan, I won't comment on first half, but I will give you some thoughts on first quarter. Your best way to analyze that, this could take a look at what happened from fourth quarter to first quarter of the most recent year coming out of 2013, 2012.
We do have seasonal increases in OpEx as we go from fourth to first typically because of an absence of vacations that we have in fourth and the partial implementation of our annual pay and benefit increases that occur in first. So they will -- you should expect those to be up and you can take a look at -- again this past year to get a rough idea as about how much that increased by in percentage terms. 
Dave Pahl
Yeah. And I would just add, Harlan, that the -- as we indicated before, Kevin pointed out that we are expecting about $15 million more savings in fourth quarter at that point will be essentially complete on those announced actions. So, we will basically be just have a seasonal impact that Kevin had mentioned.
All right, thank you. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Next caller is Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Co.
Thanks for taking the question. I will start off with a bigger picture question, Kevin. The company has done a very good job of looking forward and being proactive, taking action to either prune lower margin revenue stream such as wireless or identifying opportunities for cost savings such as the optimization program this year.
As you look ahead how much further room is there for a similar such optimization efforts? Are we really at a point where the TI model is getting very close to being optimized?
Kevin March
Yeah, Craig. I think that as we look forward from an optimization standpoint, I think the ones you've talked about so far have been more about where we might have trimmed areas that had opportunities perhaps not quite as attractive as other areas. 
I think perhaps one of the areas least appreciated as people look at TI on a go forward basis is the impact that continued delta revenue on 300 millimeter analog is going to have for us. The cost structure to build on 300 millimeter is very attractive. And so incremental revenue going forward on 300 millimeter, we expect to produce not only higher margins, but also higher levels of total cash on that delta revenue.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow on Craig?
Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Co.
Yeah, I do. Thank you. Dave, you mentioned the strength in analog power management on year-on-year basis. Was it similarly strong sequentially and what specifically is driving that strength?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. So on a sequential basis if you look at our analog business it was up primarily due to High Volume Analog & Logic, as well as Power Management. Though we did see growth really from all four businesses, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley also grew. So, you see a little bit of difference there sequentially. But again power continue to strong in both comparisons. 
Okay, thank you, Craig. We will go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS Securities, LLC.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities, LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to draw down little bit on the embedded processing segment, in particular between micro-processors and micro-controllers and I guess DSPs and application processors. 
Could you talk about some of the trends that you saw in Q3 especially from any, I guess, communications equipment exposure that you have?
Dave Pahl
Okay. So embedded processing, as you know grew 6% from a year ago. That was driven by micro-controllers, connectivity and processors each growing by about the same amount. And again as Kevin pointed out that was the eight quarter in a row of year-over-year growth. 
Sequentially, revenue was a little better than even, connectivity was up and processors and micro-controllers were about even sequentially. So, you have follow on Stephen?
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities, LLC
Yes. In terms of gross margins, I'm just wondering if this year there is an opportunity for you to take advantage of building any strategic inventory for certain products that you know have good turnover and hence maybe further optimize gross margins a little bit in a seasonally slower quarter. Thanks.
Kevin March
Yeah, Stephen, we do that on ongoing basis. That’s one of the ways that we’re able to keep sort of lead-time for the overwhelming majority of our parts to six weeks or less. In fact, we build the stock not necessarily build the order. Meaning, we maintain a stock of inventory such that we can always have short lead-times from our customers. So from a strategic standpoint that is done. 
It does have a little bit of ebb and flow. As you point out, when we have lower loadings in certain quarter it gives us chance to build up on feed extra parts on that. But I don’t think there is a whole lot of opportunity to do that just to impact the gross margins. I think we're really doing that to impact customer service.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. And I would also add, Stephen that if you take the combined way that we are managing inventory now and we're being very intentional specific targeted programs depending on how quickly that inventory turns.
But you take that plus the open capacity that we've got and the combination of those two things and we've really been able to execute at very high levels and deliver our products on time to customers. And so we think not only having low lead-times but also delivering product when you make a commitment to a customer, combination of those things are what customers would like to have.
Okay. Thank you. We move on to the next caller please.
Operator
Next we have Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you. Can you talk about where your fab utilizations are now just qualitatively and there's still an underutilization charge to -- as part of these numbers?
Kevin March
Joe on the underutilization charges, the answer is yes there are. But we're not really talking about those anymore and the reason is really kind of straight forward. We found that analysts and some inventories where on a conclusion that because we had underutilization that increase in our utilization would be the maximum amount by which we could increase our overall profitability if we put revenue into those factories, and that’s really an incomplete answer.
Remind you that our stated strategy is to invest in our capacity ahead of demand by definition. That means we will have open capacity and underutilization cost. Our purpose of providing ahead of demand is to purchase that capacity with as little cash as possible. 
So the utilization charge is mostly a non-cash charge and it tends to mix the point that our objective is to maximizing free cash flow. So for that reason you haven't really heard us commenting on or quantifying underutilization charges this past few quarters and unlikely to in the future unless there is some material changes that causes the better understanding of what's going on.
Dave Pahl
And Joe, I will just add, the last time we had stated our end-to-end capacity, it was in the $18 billion range. So if you want to get a qualitative feel of where capacity is, you can annualize our quarterly revenues and put it against that number and it will get you into the zip code. So you have a follow on Joe?
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Yeah. Thank you for that. In terms, could you give us an update on the base station market? And I know you said that continue to be strong. Just anything that you are seeing from that end market?
Dave Pahl
Well, if I just look at the communications market overall and I would -- from a year-on-year standpoint it was up primarily due to wireless infrastructure, while sequentially it was down. And basically we just saw that in -- as a seasonal pause in the fourth quarter. So thank you very much…
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley
Thank you.
Dave Pahl
And we go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next caller is Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Dave Pahl
Hi Vivek.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hello. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned a very interesting thing on improving output from your 300 millimeter fab and I was wondering if you could give us some more color around what percentage of your starts are moving to that fab?
And more importantly what that implies for gross margins? For example in the past you have mentioned about 75% fall through on gross margin. So as you increase the loading on 300 millimeter, what does that do to that number over the next several quarters or years?
Kevin March
Yeah, Vivek. I don’t know that I'm prepared to give you a detailed quantification of that nature. What I would just say is that, we've talked in past about -- just from the geometrics alone that the chip cost itself was about 30% lower on 300 millimeter than it is on 200.
Not to mention that you also get better yield results and so on, so you get a number of different benefits. So what we are seeing happening is proportionally more and more new products that we're releasing are being released on to 300 millimeter, which means as we look out over the next year, two, three, four years, more and more of our revenue will be sourced off of 300 millimeter, which inherently means it's got lower cost which should allow us to incrementally increase our gross margins as well as our importantly our free cash flow. 
Beyond that I don’t have any specifics I will give you at this point in time. But I do want to introduce that confidence to people because I think it's been underestimated as to how important that to TI's continued progress.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it.
Dave Pahl
You've got follow on Vivek?
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Dave, the question is on the end market mix, I believe, you mentioned comps was strong on year-on-year basis. I was wondering if you could just give us your end market mix overall for Q3 and how do you see those trends playing out in Q4? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Sure. Yeah. So on a year-on-year basis our revenue growth was due to coms equipment, industrial and automotive, as I mentioned before, each of which grew and contributed to that growth by about the same amount. 
Our Enterprise Systems was also up while revenue in personnel electronics declined due to legacy wireless products. So, if you kind of go down one step in each side of -- inside of each one of those, industrial, we've got about a dozen sectors inside of industrial. 
And as we've talked to different investors over the last few months and as we are traveling around, it becomes clear to us that our definition of industrial probably isn’t as well understood. And we've got -- years ago we used to define it as what it wasn’t, meaning it wasn’t coms equipment or it wasn’t automotive or it wasn’t other things.
But now we've got very intentional definitions. We've got about a dozen different sectors that make that up. So things like appliances and building automation and displays and point-of-sale products, factory automation, industrial transportation, medical healthcare, fitness, lighting, motor drives, power infrastructure, things like that. So very, very broad, but very specific. 
So when you look on year-on-year basis, we had growth in nearly all of those sectors with most of the sectors actually providing double-digit growth. It was actually led by medical and healthcare fitness and factory automation. But, again, we saw that growth very broad based.
Automotive, we've got five sectors inside of that and I'll also just point that those sectors are actually out on our website of people are interested. But we've got double-digit in all the sectors, but led by passive, safety and infotainment. 
Coms equipment, as I mentioned, was up due to wireless infrastructure. Personnel electronic was down due to legacy wireless products and if you take that out we did see growth in PC and notebooks and mobile phones and that was partially offset by some weakness that we saw in gaming.
And then the enterprise systems, that’s -- part of that is where our DLP products will sit and that was up due to projectors. So I will stop there. So thank you Vivek. We have a follow-up question?
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
No, that was my…
Dave Pahl
Yeah, thank you very much. We will go to the next caller. Thanks so much for that.
Operator
Our next caller is Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, historically, when you saw lead-times stretch for some of your competitors, not -- even if you are only time stayed stable, you would see not only double ordering at your competitors, but also double ordering at Texas Instruments as well. 
And I'm wondering if you think something is changed structurally with how guys are running the business or how that industrial operates that might have changed that dynamic?
Kevin March
Yeah, Mark. I don’t know that I will speak for the industry, but I will speak for TI and kind of go back to comment we made earlier. As a result of us taking an approach whereby we intentionally invested capacity before we needed and therefore always have more capacity that was needed for that quarter's business. It allows us to be able to build inventory in a much more thoughtful fashion than we have in the past. 
A consequence of that has been that not only have we've been able to maintain lead-times for the preponderance of our products that’s six weeks or less for several years now, we've also been able to maintain a very high level of on time delivery to our customers against those lead-times.
So when you put that together, what you've really got for TI is it's just a different way whereby we are managing our manufacturing footprint and how we utilize that manufacturing for purposes of managing inventory. 
As it relates to double ordering, again, one of the biggest things that tends to be evident when double orderings begins to popup as you start seeing cancellations or reschedulings beginning to ramp up. We do not see that and we have not seen that for some time now. 
So I think the strategy whereby we have capacity ahead of demand and we use that thoughtfully to make sure that we can maintain relatively low lead-times is severing well to satisfying our customers at least as it relates to demand for our products.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-up Mark?
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies
Yes, I do. And that’s helpful, Kevin. And the follow-up is actually on that topic about the lead-times. I think earlier in the script you said you're delivering -- you are focused on delivering higher levels of customer service. And then I think you said, you followed that up with saying we are keeping lead-times consistently low.
So, I guess, I'm just trying to reconcile when you say delivering higher levels of customer service, are you -- do you think that you have your lead-times over maybe a longer period of time have come end that they're just structurally shorter? Or are you just delivering them more consistently at a shorter time.
So I just have to reconcile when you said, what is the higher level of customer service? What is the improvement have been? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for clarification. I think it’s a real good question. So when we referred of that, we look at a bunch of different customer service metrics. One is just how many line items are we shipping on time and we've had some very intentional initiatives that have been set up to be able to ensure that that is a good solid number and we are taking advantage of both the capacity and our inventory to ensure that we are consistently delivering on time.
And so that’s one of the metrics that we look at and that’s what we mean by customer service, it's not really changing those lead-times, but keeping them stable and then delivering products when we saw that we'll deliver them. It's really the combination of those two things. 
So thanks Mark, and we will go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back, Kevin, on gross margin, if you could just go through what drove the offside versus your guidance, then you're obviously sustaining that going forward. Is there anything that doesn’t repeat in such that --and it sounds like you can grow it off this space. Just want to make sure I heard that right. 
Kevin March
Yeah, Blayne, the guidance actually -- we are up a little bit from guidance, not a huge amount. But really what we have was little bit more revenue come through. But importantly we also have a slightly better mix of product that we ship to our customer. And so combined that gave us a slightly higher gross margin than previous expected.
And then on a go forward basis, again, that mix continues to be in our favor as we go forward and so consequently as we look into fourth quarter our margins will continue to be quite strong. 
And importantly, because of the rather unique situation that we have with 300 millimeter analog manufacturing capacity, we have significant opportunity to continue to drive not just improved margins but importantly good cash flow.
Again, I will remind you some of the things that we do. We've got 300 millimeter analog. I do want to make that point of having it. We've got a lot more of our revenue coming from catalog parts which inherently tend to have more attractive margin characteristics.
We have increasing portions of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive spaces and those three concepts are pretty important. Catalog parts, industrial, automotive tend to have very nice long revenue streams, which means we have plenty of time to figure out and maximize our cost efficiency from production standpoint and maximize our revenue and cash flow off that.
Now, we've got increasing customer diversity. So our dependence on any one customer and therefore of the risk to our loadings or cash flow generation are diminished. And perhaps also very importantly we have a sales force that we estimate to be three to four times larger than our nearest competitors and those folks are becoming increasingly productive.
And so we're beginning to get a lot more revenue per sales person which means we can grow revenue without having to grow OpEx as fast as revenues growing. Those things combined not only will help our margins, but also definitely help our cash flow. 
Dave Pahl
Okay. Blayne, you have a follow-up question? 
Blayne Curtis - Barclays
Yeah, thanks. So just for a big picture level, I think you already answered this, but I just wanted to make sure I missed anything. We've had seen some companies referenced part still weaknesses. I mean, I would say your results are normal, if not even better than normal. 
Are you seeing any areas that are weak and you are offsetting that with share gains or strength elsewhere? Just curious your perspective or are you not seeing any weakness at all anywhere?
Dave Pahl
Well, yeah, I will let you draw the conclusions from the numbers. I think that, obviously, the results are solid. I think that the outlook is consistent with the orders and our visibility into what customers are telling us they want from a consignment standpoint. So -- and from a share gain standpoint, I think that we've had multiple years now where we have had gain share, think it's always hard to tell in any one particular quarter that you're picking up share, but I think when you look back over a year, you can see that trend. So, we believe in our numbers, there share gains, but I'd be careful and anyone quarter to be able to point that out.
So, thank you Blayne. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the one segment nobody has asked about thus far is other, did a bit better than I had expected. Dave you broke down what was the year-over-year and sequentials with the sub buckets in the other two segments. Can you do that for the other segment as well? And if it is DLP, give us a little description on is there some seasonality in that that we need to appreciate going forward? Thanks.
Dave Pahl
Sure, sure. Thanks Ross. Yeah, so on a year-on-year basis, again, other was even. We saw a decline in legacy wireless products and that was mostly offset by the growth in DLP products.
On a sequential basis -- let me just finish year-on-year. If you look beyond that, calculators as well as custom ASIC business were up and royalties were down just slightly. So sequentially, revenue was up due to growth in calculators and DLPs. Royalties were flat and custom ASIC was down a little bit.
So, I'd say that all of those businesses are performing well and if you look at DLP, they are typically stronger in the back half of the year in third quarter, but I would say that business is just executing well.
When we look at that business longer term, I describe that it's got several wildcard growth opportunities. If you look at most of the business today, it will be centered up in the front projectors that you'll typically see in offices and schools and government buildings, but -- and it also has a solid cinema business, but from a broader standpoint, it's some opportunities inside of automotive as well as some embedded opportunities there as well.
Kevin March
Pico as well.
Dave Pahl
Yeah, the Pico projectors as well. So, thanks Ross, do you have a follow-up?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
I do. Kevin you were helpful in giving us some balance around the OpEx and looking at prior years and how things have dropped seasonally due to vacations et cetera in both the fourth and in the first quarter doing the other direction.
Can you give us a little bit of a harder number on what that typical percentage changes quarter-to-quarter? Looking back in the past you guys have had a number of restructuring programs that make it a little bit difficult to parse out what seasonality and what is restructuring driven in both the fourth of the first quarter? Thank you.
Kevin March
Yeah, Ross I actually pointed to the last fourth to first transition with the idea, that's a good one for you to look at because in fact the timing of the announcement for the embedded process and Japan restructuring, you may remember we announced that in January of this past year, so we hadn't even begun the activities yet inside the first quarter. So, the underlying cost in there is fairly clean from a competitive standpoint between fourth and first and so I'd use that as your figure of (merit) [ph] to trying to figure where we go in 2014.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thanks Ross. That was helpful clarification. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next caller is Doug Friedman with RBC Capital.
Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets
Great. Thanks for taking my--
Dave Pahl
Hi Doug.
Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets
Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a real strong results here. If I could Kevin maybe attack really high level one. You guys have been in the past very acquisitive so much so that you really rebuild your whole business model through acquisitions. Can you maybe talk about your appetite to maybe add some debt onto your already leveraged balance sheet? And what it would take for you to look at another significant deal?
Kevin March
Okay, Doug it's not like may be there's two ideas in your question, one on M&A, one on debt. Clearly, on the M&A front, as you point out, we have been quite willing to take on M&A activities when it makes sense and our definition of what makes sense firstly has to be a strategic fit meaning that it really has to make sense for why we want to take the company.
As we look at potential M&A in the future, it's most likely to be biased towards analog and probably towards items with catalog parts, service the industrial or automotive spaces. There may be others, but those are the most likely areas that we would look at.
If it turns out that it checks off that strategic fit standpoint and of course, we'll have to take a look at the numbers and make sure that the price that we would pay met -- what I mean by that is not necessarily what its market cap is but the market we probably have to pay on top of that, that that total cost would be accretive to our lack or way the average cost of capital in the two to four year timeframe. So, there's the several test that we go through and we will make a termination on acquisition.
As it relates to debt, as you know we have taken on debt to support acquisitions in the past. We think having the balance sheet available to support those kinds of strategic initiatives are important and a worthwhile thing for us to maintain for maximum flexibility as we move forward and so as we look out in time and even look at the last couple of years, while we have been issuing new debt, we've also been retiring older debt and retiring a little bit faster than what we've been issuing so that we're taking our whole debt levels down that's having the result of generally slowly opening the balance sheet back up to make itself available for any other opportunity that might present itself at some point in the future. So, that's how we're looking at M&A and that's how debt kind of roles inside that book.
Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets
Great. Thanks for all that color.
Dave Pahl
Do you have a follow-up?
Doug Friedman - RBC Capital Markets
Yeah, I guess if I could, can you guys pretty much along the same ideas on the balance sheet and how you look at cash return, I might have missed it did you happen to give out the share price at which you bought back shares this quarter? And would you moderate going forward given the share price pullback that we just saw, how we should think about share count going forward?
Kevin March
Let's see, we bought back $670 million worth of shares this quarter, total of 14.1 million shares, so that's an average price of about $47.62. I would point out that over the last -- since the end of 2004 beginning 2005, we reduced our total share count by 39% that the average price of those shares that we bought over that time, I believe were about $30.62 give or take.
When we look to buy back shares as we talked about in the past when the intrinsic value we believe was higher than what the market value is, then it makes sense to buyback on a steady, if you will, dollar across averaging kind of basis, that's what we've done for many years and that's what you've seen us do here recently.
In fact, the recent pullback in price is just allowing us to buyback a few more shares with the same number of dollars. So, that's kind of a round the world look at share repurchase if you will. That answers your question on that Doug?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. Thank you, Doug. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Following Doug, we have Will Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Humphrey Robinson
Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. I'm hoping you can quantify a comment that you made earlier about the portion of sales on 300 millimeter today and that could increase over time. Kevin could you talk a little bit about where that number is now and where you'd see going over the next couple of years?
Kevin March
Yes, Will, I think we're going to try to just hold back and say it is proportionally more than it has -- each period that goes by is proportionally more, but I think that we'll hold at a little while longer till we can get a more comprehensive look and better understanding for everybody on how to think about that 300 going forward.
I just do think that it's -- again the highest level it’s a fairly straightforward competition. 30% lower dye cost which means about 50% lower total -- total IC cost. And as we get proportionally more revenue going on there that will just incrementally benefit our margins on our cash flows as we go forward in time. That is something that I've become aware of and talking to investors the last couple of quarters that is underappreciated and what's going on inside the portfolio itself.
William Stein - SunTrust Humphrey Robinson
That's helpful. Appreciate it. And as my follow-up, another comment that was made earlier was about I think the relative strength of analog versus the embedded segment this quarter and I think there was a comment about end markets, the end market mix helping, I am wondering if you could quantify that? Maybe help us understand of the better. I know analog is very diversified relative to embedded, but maybe talk about if they were maybe some end markets that were a bit more challenging that effectively embedded segment a bit more?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think if you look at embedded, it will have a high exposure to really three different markets. Its communications, equipment, industrial and automotive and like you said our analog business has a much broader exposure including exposure to personal electronics. It has obviously good exposure to industrial and automotive as well, but it's really those types of differences that will explain that performance.
If you look at embedded processing and you look back at the growth rates between the two businesses, you'll note that often times they will grow at different rates. But if you look over that eight quarter period that embedded processing has been growing year-over-year, the growth rate for both of those businesses are essentially -- exactly the same, so kind of works out that way over a longer period of time.
So, thank you Will, and we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
The next question comes from Tore Svanberg.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus
Yes, good afternoon Dave and Kevin. My first question is on sort of the general environment, Q4 is obviously a seasonally down quarter anyway, it's hard to get a read on what's going on. But as we sort of -- or as you talk to your customers and we compare now let's say versus 12 months ago, would you classify the forecast in the environment as a better, weaker or about the same?
Kevin March
Tory I guess I probably say that it's about the same. I wouldn't classify it is better or weaker, I said it about the same in that -- again we have had the same lead-times for several years and customers are ordering consistent with that generally speaking. You get some of expert from time-to-time because they've under-ordered or have a surprise on their but that was true a year ago and it's probably true today.
And we continue to see customers manage their inventories of our products as they have early as was mentioned earlier and the distribution channel, we're at all-time lows a 4.5 weeks of inventory that's same last quarter and this quarter that's very low.
From a customer standpoint, we see them again ordering lead-time and consistent ordering patterns so that tells us they are order -- they are keeping their inventories very low. So, I think overall I probably characterize it as relatively the same kind of customer demeanor today as what we saw a year ago.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus
Yes, thanks Kevin, that's very helpful. My follow-up question Dave, if I have one.
Dave Pahl
Sure. Please.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel Nicolaus
Yes. So, your annual growth 10% year-over-year is that the goal internally to continue to grow the analog business 10% every year or was there anything unusual here the last 12 months that kept that growth rate so high?
Dave Pahl
Well, I would say that internally we have very aggressive goals to grow the businesses and I just describe that as we want to outgrow the market significantly in analog, so we have got all the business units that are focused up on that.
We do look at the performance of the product lines every quarter and we really look at a three-year compounded annual growth rate and stack that up against all the other businesses both inside of TI as well as competitors externally and that's how we measure it.
So, again as I've said earlier a 10% we believe would represent some share gain, but it would be real cautious to look at anyone quarter and draw the conclusion or try to dice out what percentage of that growth would be from share gains.
So, okay thank you Tory and we’ll -- operator, I think we've got time for one more caller.
Operator
Yes sir. And we have CJ Muse with ISI Group.
CJ Muse - ISI Group
Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question it's a point of clarification on the OpEx outlook for Q4 down $15 million, is that all restructuring and then there's gravy on top of that in terms of seasonal savings or is that $15 million include the seasonal savings?
Kevin March
CJ, the thing here to do is take a look at year ago third quarter, fourth quarter there was a seasonal decrease. On top of that will be another $15 million as the last rest of the EP restructuring is completed.
CJ Muse - ISI Group
Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess second question, I was hoping you could talk about inventories downstream. Clearly relatively healthy on your books, but would love to hear what your thoughts are in terms of -- in particular at the [disty] level?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Our inventories really from a day standpoint have remained unchanged at what I would just describe historically low levels, just a little over four and a half weeks. Again, that number is low because of the consignment programs that we have put in place.
Beyond our distributors and into our customers, we do have a good percentage of our revenues on consignment overall and in fact, if you combine what we shipped through distribution as well as what we ship to OEMs on consignment that represents about 50% or about half of our revenues where we actually there is no inventory sitting in front of us and that manufacturing line for those inventories. So, we know that inventory number and it is zero.
So, we have very good visibility into that portion and we do have a balance of the business that's kind of the classic -- I'll describe it as book ship type business where they give us an order and goes on to a backlog and we ship it at lead-time. So, -- and there we haven't seen any reports of large inventory pockets from customers, we're going through and racking up this quarter's results and we will see what happens on that front but we're not aware of any big pockets that are downstream.
So, okay well thank you very much CJ for your question. Thank you all for joining us today and a replay of this call will be available on our website. Good evening.

Please stand by. Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin Marks, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. In addition, Dave Pahl has joined us.
As many of you know, I will retire in August and Dave will replace me as Head of Investor Relations. Dave has worked at TI for 25 years and has worked directly with me Investor Relations for 10 years. With that consideration, you probably should allow him some time to come up to speed.
Dave has also been recently elected by TI's Board to the position of Company Vice President. Dave will moderate today's call. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thank you, Ron. It's good to join you today for the call. And now down to business.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and any relevant non-GAAP reconciliation on our website at TI.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and could be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for more complete description.
The second quarter was another solid quarter. Our core businesses of analog and embedded processing grew strongly with combined revenue up 14% from a year ago. We continue to benefit from our investments in industrial and automotive as these important markets continue to grow as a percentage of our revenue.
Revenue of $3.29 billion came in slightly higher than the middle of the expected range we communicated to you in April. Earnings per share of $0.62 were near the top of our expected range as profitability was stronger in the quarter. Free cash flow of $3.2 billion or 25% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period was right in line with the 20% to 30% range in which we expect to operate over time.
Also over the past 12 months we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. As a reminder, our model for cash returns to shareholders is to return all of our free cash flow less the net debt amount that is retired, plus any proceeds we received from exercises of equity compensation. This model demonstrates our confidence in TI'x business and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
In the second quarter TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago, with double-digit growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by power management. High-performance analog, high-volume analog and logic and Silicon Valley analog also grew.
Embedded processing revenue grew 14% from a year ago, primarily due to processors and micro-controllers, both of which grew about the same amount. Connectivity grew at a faster rate, although it was coming from a much smaller base. Embedded processing delivered its seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year growth as our investments over the past few years in strategic areas are yielding favorable results.
In our other segment, revenue declined $90 million or 13% from a year ago due to legacy wireless which is essentially gone.
Turning to distribution, resales increased 15% from a year ago while distributors' inventories were about even. Weeks of inventories fell by several days to just over 4-1/2 weeks. This reduction was driven by a higher percentage of resales being supported by TI's consignment inventory programs.
From an end-market perspective, most growth from the year-ago came in communications equipment, followed by automotive and industrial. Enterprise Systems was also up while revenue in personal electronics declined due to mobile phones and tablets, areas that use legacy wireless products from TI.
Now, Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone.
Gross profit in the quarter was $1.88 billion or 57.1% of revenue. Gross profit increased 20% from the year-ago quarter and gross margin hit another new record. When compared with the previous record in the third quarter of 2013, revenue was $48 million higher and gross profit was $102 million. This reflects an improved product portfolio focus on analog and embedded processing, as well as increased efficiency in our manufacturing operations.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $821 million was down $39 million from a year ago. The decline primarily reflects the reductions in legacy wireless as well as continued cost discipline across TI. Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $4 million benefit. As a reminder, the year-ago quarter included a gain of $315 million associated with the transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer.
Operating profit was $982 million or 29.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 8% from the year-ago quarter.
Net income in the second quarter was $683 million or $0.62 per share.
Let me comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations were $775 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 111, consistent with our model of 105 million to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $80 million in the quarter.
On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $3.59 billion, up 8% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $388 million or 3% of revenue, even lower than our long-term expectation of 4%. Although we've been able to keep capital expenditures at this low level, we continue to invest to expand both our capabilities and our capacity.
As examples, capital expenditures in the second quarter included the cost to prepare the site and install the first tools into our new assembly and test facility in Chengdu, China. We completed manufacturing our first units there for qualification purposes. In addition, we brought on additional tools to expand capacity in our 300 millimeter facility in Richardson, Texas. We were able to make these investments and keep our capital spending at low levels because of our strategy to invest in capacity opportunistically and ahead of demand.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.20 billion or 25% of revenue, in the middle of our expected 20% to 30% range. Free cash flow was 10% higher than a year ago.
Depreciation expense for the past 12 months was $856 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $468 million or 3.7% of revenue. We continue to expect the whole capital spending at low levels or at about 4% of revenue. As a result, the depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margins will directly benefit.
As we said, we believe strong cash flow growth, particularly free cash flow growth, is most important to maximize shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business. To that end, in the second quarter, TI paid $323 million in dividends and repurchased $743 million of our stock for a total return of $1.07 billion.
The shareholder return part of our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow minus debt retirement plus any proceeds that we receive from exercises of equity compensation. Total cash return in the past 12 months was $4.2 billion, which was 18% higher than a year ago. Dividends were up 32% and stock repurchases were up 13%. Fundamental to our cash return strategy are our cash management and tax practices.
We ended the second quarter with $2.80 billion of cash and short-term investments, down from $4.03 billion at the beginning of the quarter. The decline mostly reflects the use of $1 billion to retire debt in the quarter. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders in the quarter were $3.33 billion, up 7% from a year ago, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.01, which would have been higher but was impacted by the conversion of consignment of some products that are sold through distribution.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.31 billion to $3.59 billion in the third quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 6% from the year ago. If you exclude the $57 million of legacy wireless revenue from the year-ago quarter, revenue would increase 8%.
We expect third quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.76. Restructuring charges will continue to be essentially nil. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at this level for the next five years.
Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the third quarter.
In summary, the second quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model, focused on analog and embedded processing which we believe are the best opportunities inside of the semiconductor market. We continue to invest in areas that offer sustainable growth, solid profitability and good cash flow from operations. The percentage of our business from industrial and automotive markets continues to grow as customers increasingly embrace technology that makes end-products smarter and more connected. At the same time, we continue to invest in our manufacturing capabilities, and our strategy to opportunistically acquire manufacturing assets means that we can deliver strong free cash flows. We continue to demonstrate, as we did again in the second quarter, our commitment to provide strong returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.

And we'll now take the first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse
Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Kevin, I guess my first question is on OpEx. I think for the June quarter, going into June, you kind of guided OpEx would be flattish Q-on-Q, and you did better than that. I'm kind of curious, is that a pull-in of the $130 million of annualized savings you expected from the restructuring or is that just a bigger number than 130? And how do we think about OpEx trending in September, in the back half of the year?
Kevin March
Yeah, John, you're right, the OpEx we had expected to be roughly even from first quarter and the second quarter, and that came in a bit lower than we had expected. And part of that was some pull-in with the restructuring actions that we announced in the first quarter for both embedded processing and resizing of our operation in Japan, and part of it was just continued discipline on the part of all the business units in TI when it came to spending.
As you look into 3Q, we continue to expect the second half to be the primary benefit of the cost savings that we talked about for those restructuring action. Recall [ph] that we expect about $130 million of annualized savings, with about 85% of that in OpEx and the balance in cost of revenue. So as we go into third quarter, we'll see probably about half of that amount come in to our results in OpEx, with the balance in fourth quarter. So by the time we leave the year, we should be at an annualized $130 million cost savings from that action.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-up, John?
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse
Yeah, that's helpful, Kevin. As a follow-up, I know this is somewhat of an unfair question, but if you look at the proceeds from equity compensation. Last year it was almost about a third of the cash returns to investors. I know that's been a volatile number and probably a number that's impossible to predict. But I'm kind of curious, how should you think we should think about that number going forward from here? How do we try to model that number in the future?
Kevin March
John, we talked in -- during the update to our capital management strategy that going forward we would expect the proceeds from stock option exercises to reduce considerably. We saw, gosh, I think it was probably two to three times our normal rate stock option exercises and cash proceeds, in 2013 than we'd seen in prior years. So we'd talked about that going forward that would probably come back down to a more normalized level. And I would suspect that, you know, what we saw last quarter, what we saw this quarter, probably is more reflective of what you should model going forward, figure about, you know, I think we saw about 4% or 5% of stock options exercised last year, and that'll probably drop back down to 1.5%, 2% kind of level.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, John. Next caller please?
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs
Great guys. Thanks so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. You know, could you just give us some perspective on kind of the broader cyclical environment? Would you say there's anything at all going on other than normal, and maybe break that down by sub-category a little bit? And I'll leave that as both questions and pass from there. Thanks.
Dave Pahl
Okay, Jim. I think that, you know, we don't have any unique insight into what's going on from a cyclical standpoint. I think that the quarter that we just delivered, you know, we feel good about. If you look at the middle of our range into third quarter, 8% if you're excluding legacy wireless, is another good quarter on a year-on-year basis.
If you look at a lot of the signals that one would pay attention to, such as inventory inside of the channel, we took several days out of inventory in the quarter as we had a higher percentage of revenue supported by our consignment programs inside of distribution. And if you look at cancellations, they continue to remain at very, very low levels. We think inventory at customers remains in check as well.
So -- and then if you look at our lead times, they continue to remain stable. We'll always have some pockets where they may move out temporarily. But with our capacity and the position of our inventory, we feel really good to be able to continue to support that.
So you have a follow-up question?
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs
The sub, the verticals, any differences by vertical?
Dave Pahl
No. I think that from a year-on-year standpoint we had, if you look at industrial, we had growth in nearly all the sectors, so, very broad-based from that standpoint, led by areas like factory automation. Automotive we had double-digit growth, and all of our sectors led by ADAS or Advanced Driver Systems. Personal electronics was down, but it would have been up had it not been for legacy wireless. Our enterprise systems we saw growth, driven by projectors and servers. And coms equipment was up due to wireless infrastructure. So, really broad-based growth on that stand.
Okay, thanks. We'll go to the next caller.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to dig in to your, I guess, your margin trajectory. Your incremental operating margins for analog and embedded processing both exceeded 100% sequentially in the quarter. Your analog business also has about 100% incremental operating margins year over year. I guess the strong performance, particularly in analog, surprises me a little bit. I thought most of the cut you did were in embedded processing. So I wonder if you could give us some sort of view on what's driving that strong incremental margin, how much of that is sort of gross margin expansion within the businesses versus OpEx. And what do you sort of see as sort of sustainable levels of incremental operating margin going forward as the revenues in the businesses continue to grow?
Kevin March
Yes, Stacy, the fall-through was very good both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, certainly at the company level and at the segment levels. The -- I'd mentioned I guess on the first call from John that, from an OpEx standpoint, spending remains disciplined across the company. So while the restructuring action that you referred to will disproportionately benefit embedded processing versus other areas of the company, some of that will also -- some of that restructuring will benefit other areas of the company as well.
For example, we mentioned resizing our sales team in Japan. And that, not just the sales team in support of embedded processing but also those in support of some of the other business units. So you get a little bit of benefit there. But then really you got just disciplined spending across the company, as frankly people are spending only what they need to support the growth of the business.
On a go-forward basis, again we expect OpEx to be down a little bit sequentially, primarily for the benefit of embedded processing. That'll be true for both the third and fourth quarter. Beyond that, I don't know if that gives you any more specific forecast on OpEx other than, by the time we reach the end of the year, we will enter next year with OpEx about, total cost savings from the restructuring, about $130 million, about 85% of that coming off OpEx.
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein
Got it. That's helpful.
Yeah. For my follow-on, I want to dig in to gross margin just a little bit. So if I take that, you know, half of the $130 million kind of hitting you or 85% hitting you by next quarter, it sounds to me like you're guiding OpEx down about 2%, which would give me an implied gross margin guidance at the corporate level, call it into the upper 57%, so, you know, up maybe 500 basis points, maybe a little more, off from Q2. So can you give us just some view of what's driving that gross margin expansion? Is this just further efficiencies, manufacturing efficiencies, is this just depreciation coming down? Is this something also to do with mix or pricing, or just overall revenue leverage as revenues grow?
Kevin March
You know, I think it's a little bit of all of that, to be quite frank, Stacy. The -- if you take a look at, as we go forward on gross margin, you know, there's multiple drivers inside the portfolio, not the least of which is being able to load or fill up our very cost-effective factories. We also get improved product mix, especially as we see industrial and automotive becoming a larger portion of our total revenue mix. And finally, we get the benefit from depreciation as it begins to roll off, being that the CapEx is running substantially below depreciation now for quite some time. Again just to remind, the depreciation was about 7% of revenue over the last 12 months and CapEx is expected to around 4%. So, you know, we get some closure that will start happening over the next couple of years. Depreciation this year is expected to be down a bit versus last year, but it'll start to climb more rapidly next year.
So you got a number of different things going on, not just next quarter, that will move gross margins up again, as you indicated, but should also continue to benefit us as we look out into the balance of the year and going into 2015.
Dave Pahl
Great. Thank you, Stacy. Operator, we can go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
We'll go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays next.
Blayne Curtis – Barclays
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Wondering what utilization was in the quarter and where you expect that to go. And then the second part of my question, as you look into December, typically seasonally softer period, things seem fairly normal. I was wondering your thoughts on just seasonality into December.
Kevin March
I'll mention -- I'll talk to utilization and Dave will talk to seasonality there. But, you know, Blayne, we look at utilization 2Q to 3Q, we don't expect that to really change all that much, as we, you know, have our wafer starts not too far off from what we saw in the first quarter and what we -- excuse me, the second quarter, and what we saw in the second quarter will come out of the factory in the third quarter. So overall utilization, unlikely to change all that much as we look into the near term.
Dave Pahl
And from a seasonality standpoint, Blayne, essentially we're going to let you determine what you believe seasonality is. And just a few things to consider as you go through that, obviously calculator revenue is usually strongest in second quarter and third quarter with the back-to-school buying period, and you saw that in our results this quarter. And our semiconductor growth is typically relatively stronger in the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth.
So, outside of that, we don't put much credence on a specific sequential growth number just because the numbers around that have been so unpredictable, and we're just going to step back from trying to provide any appearance of doing that on it, because it'll appear that we're endorsing one number over another, so.
You have a follow-on, Blayne?
Blayne Curtis – Barclays
Just wondering, maybe in the September quarter, a similar question, whether outside of calculators there's any areas of particular strength or weakness. You had mentioned com had been a strong point. Is that sustaining? And then it seems like autos as well have held in there better, usually seasonally weaker second half, but seems strong. Any comments there?
Dave Pahl
Sure, yeah. Other than the top-line [[ph] guidance, we don't really get into strength or weakness by sector. If there's something very unusual going on, like with our legacy wireless, of course we've given visibility into those types of things in the past.
So with that, we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
Thank you. We'll move to Doug Friedman with RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Friedman – RBC Capital Markets
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And before I begin my question, Ron, it's been great working with you, and best of luck in retirement, before forgetting to say that.
So going into the numbers, if you could talk a little bit maybe about your strategy to maybe increase free cash flow. When we look at sort of what's going on with your balance sheet, you're getting pretty close to getting a debt level that might be good to carry that debt and stop retiring it or maybe just start rolling it forward. Can you maybe talk a little bit, Kevin, about your strategy there?
Kevin March
Well, the strategy is less about debt and more about the actual product portfolio and the markets we're going after, Doug. It's really about being sure that we're thoughtful on how we spend our research and development dollars, and we spend them on products that we expect to have very long revenue life streams off of them.
And then in correlation with that is to continue to be opportunistic and to expand our manufacturing capacity at times when you may least expect us to do that, because we can get it for costs that are very low. Those are our two biggest levers for expanding cash flow.
As it relates to debt going forward, as you observed, we just paid off in debt of $500 million this year. We raised $500 million in the first quarter and repaid $1 billion in the second quarter, so a net reduction of $500 million.
We still have on the balance sheet total debt of about $4.625 billion, and those actually have lives that extend all the way out to 2023. So I don't see balance vanishing from -- debt vanishing from our balance sheet anytime soon.
On a go-forward basis, of course our buyback, I think that was one of the things you were asking about on the free cash flow, is really a function of what our calculation of net present value of the company is. And so long as we see that the intrinsic value of the company exceeds the market value, we'll continue to be buyers of the stock.
Doug Friedman – RBC Capital Markets
Okay. And --
Dave Pahl
Doug, you have a follow-up?
Doug Friedman – RBC Capital Markets
Yeah. What role will M&A possibly play, and when do you think is there an opportunity to reenter the M&A markets? You guys really have not been active since the National Semi deal has closed.
Kevin March
You know, when it comes to M&A, again it's about product strategy. Our bias is likely to be to find an opportunity that would be attractive to us. Our bias would probably be in the analog space as opposed to embedded processing. And frankly, aside from the technology that we acquire and the product opportunity that we acquire, being attractive, meaning long revenue streams, it would also have to work for us mathematically, meaning that the price at which we could acquire it would have to be such that we could get a return on our invested capital inside of three to four-year period. And we're pretty disciplined about that.
Some of the opportunities that some have speculated on here in recent months are such, if we do the math, it's very difficult to overcome that hurdle of making sure its ROIs be accretive. And we think that's very important if we're going to actually generate excess cash flow and free cash flow off of any acquisition in the future.
Dave Pahl
Okay. Thank you, Doug. Operator, next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore – Morgan Stanley
Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk around the strengths that you alluded to in communications equipment in Q2. Is that macro base stations or is there some other element of that?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. The majority of that is -- would be macro base stations. If you look at investments that we're making longer term, that will include small cell, but we really don't have measurable revenue on products like that at this point.
Joe Moore – Morgan Stanley
Okay, thanks. And as part of the embedded restructuring that you had done, it sounded you were pulling back on some of the investing in that category. Does that your trajectory at all or does that mean you'll participate less in base stations over time?
Dave Pahl
No. I think if you look at those investments and those product cycles, they tend to have -- they tend to be very long in nature. So the areas that we've pulled back tend to be areas that we now believe are either mature or in the process of maturing, and yet we continue to invest in areas that will drive growth in the future as much as small cells, as I indicated before, so.
Thank you, Joe. And we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll move to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava – BMO Capital Markets
Hi, thank you. A question on CapEx, Kevin. Your capital intensity has been fairly below the 4% that you had said that you would be. What should we be modeling for the remainder of the year? And more importantly, what would cause it to move and check [ph] upwards?
Kevin March
Yeah, Ambrish, you know, again I think for purposes of your models, I would just assume about a 4% of revenue kind of planning. It's going to get you pretty close to probably the right answer over time. In any one quarter I'm sure it's going to be off, but it will be okay for -- on a rough annual period.
Anything that might cause us to go above that could possibly be if we had a sudden opportunity present itself, we could add capacity at a significant cost savings. We wouldn't let than 4% artificially restrain us from taking advantage of very inexpensive manufacturing capacity which would benefit our future free cash flow. But right now I don't see that on the horizon, so again for your model I'd probably just use 4%.
Ambrish Srivastava – BMO Capital Markets
Okay. And my quick follow-up, Dave, you mentioned that consignment as a percent of sales has changed. What has it gone back up? And I think I remember it used to be in the mid-40s before?
Dave Pahl
Yeah. If you look overall, our consignment as a percent of revenue has moved up a little bit from about 45% to about 50%. If you look inside of our distribution channel, so about 55% of our revenues are -- go through distribution and about 55% of those revenues are supported by consignment. So that's really the part that's beginning to drive that higher and our inventories that's owned by distributors lower.
So, thanks, Ambrish, and we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets.
Christopher Rolland – FBR Capital Markets
Hey guys. So your extra capacity, you know, at the bottom of the cycle may have been a bit of a burden but can be very valuable as the cycle heats up here. So do you think we're at the point in the cycle where you guys are benefiting from that extra capacity either front-end or backend? Do you think that some of your competitors might have a lack of capacity there, might be switching to your products?
Kevin March
Christopher, clearly we've had this strategy in place now for a number of years where we're acquiring as inexpensively as we can manage to in advance of our needs. The most recent example was the acquisition of an assembly test operation in Chengdu, China that I commented on in the call that we're now bringing online. And so that has certainly been a benefit to us, to allow us to have very stable lead times on behalf of our customers, and to be able to meet any short-term spikes or inside lead time requests that customers had had.
You know, broadly speaking, across the industry, it does break [ph] us that many people perhaps have chosen not to invest in as much capacity as they might have in the past. It's unclear to us just what that may mean going forward. But at least from our standpoint for our customers, they can have confidence that we have ample capacity to meet their need.
Dave Pahl
Yeah, and Chris, I'll add also, you know, we've taken other actions that utilize that capacity different points of demand. And so one thing that we've done, and you can see it on the balance sheet, is that in periods of weaker demand we'll actually build finished good inventory as well as aging wafers to support future demand on low-volume products.
And so it may take 20 minutes, 30 minutes to set up a piece of assembly test equipment, and you may run only 10,000 units on that part, and it may take up a half-hour or an hour. It doesn't take much longer to build either, you know, six months of demand or a full year of demand or a year-and-a-half of demand, and put that on the shelves. So when demand actually gets stronger, we've got the capacity open and available to support that stronger demand. So we feel good to be able to support really any demand environment that we see in the future.
You have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Rolland – FBR Capital Markets
Sure. The other segment, it was above the Street, also above seasonality. Is that just calculators or is there something else there?
Kevin March
Yeah, that's really just calculators, just seasonally strong in the second and third quarter for the back-to-school selling season, and then is typically weaker in the fourth and first quarter as kids are already in school and have their calculators.
Dave Pahl
Thank you, Chris. Now we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America
Thanks for taking my question. And good luck to both Dave and to Ron.
For my first question, I'm curious, what are under-utilization charges running at right now? And at what level of utilization can they go to zero?
Kevin March
Yeah, Vivek, they were about $56 million last quarter, down from the prior quarter which was about $105 million.
And that's a bit of a theoretical question as to, you know, what revenue it would take to get to zero. Clearly the mix of products flowing across the various manufacturing flows are going to have a direct bearing on that. So if we had much higher demand but it was on a flow where we didn't have a lot of excess capacity, it wouldn't help much on the under-utilization. So our job on that is to make sure that all of our flows maintain open capacity.
And I'll remind everybody again that the under-utilization, we don't let that distract us. It's an accounting adjustment that affects -- nothing happens to free cash flow. We are completely focused on free cash flow as the way to return value to our shareholders.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. And Vivek, I'll also mention that that charge is -- less than half of it is actual cash, so -- or about half of it is non-cash. So, really doesn't impact our free cash flow by having that open capacity.
Do you have a follow-up?
Vivek Arya – Bank of America
Yeah. So I guess that means open capacity you have is more source of keeping CapEx low and free cash flow rather than being a big source of expanding gross margins.
But maybe on to my second question, on the demand environment, can you give us a sense, I think you mentioned end-markets, but what about the geographies, are there certain geos that are better or worse than what you thought two months ago? Thank you.
Dave Pahl
Okay. So let me follow up on the last one, just to make a clarifying point.
So as Kevin talked about, there are certain factories that, you know, and you've seen some competitors, some of the manufacturers in Taiwan run above 100% capacity. So, you know, when we've got factories or flows that run above 100% or above the theoretical level that we've got from utilization standpoint, we'll continue to get a benefit, and we still may have an under-utilization charge. So, don't think that that -- all you have left is revenue growth, that small number that's an under-utilization charge. So, just wanted to make that clear.
So from a regional standpoint, year over year, Vivek, we saw Asia, Europe and Japan were up. The U.S. was -- it was roughly even from a year-ago standpoint.
So with that, we'll get to the next caller.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from CJ Muse with ISI Group.
CJ Muse – ISI Group
Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, once OpEx normalizes in calendar '2014, how should we think about growth in OpEx relative to top line into 2015 and beyond?
Kevin March
Well, CJ, that's a long way planning you're doing there for a semiconductor analyst. You know, from an OpEx standpoint, I think that it will probably grow at least with the change in paying benefits that you'd expect on a year-over-year basis, so you'd certainly start there. And then to the extent that we see additional opportunities that we may want to invest in from an R&D standpoint or additional sales opportunities we may want to expand, it may go a bit beyond that.
But typically you're going to see -- I think last year, paying benefits increased, average, around 3%, maybe 4%, depending upon the average from around the world. So that's what I'd probably use for planning.
CJ Muse – ISI Group
Okay, helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, question on the cycle. It looks like your guide for Q3 year over year is slowing a bit, and would love to hear your thoughts on where we are here. Will we -- rebuilding inventory downstream and now we're normalizing and now attracting more with GDP and/or, you know, are there any signs of re-acceleration in GDP or in demand in any point geographically or product life, et cetera?
Dave Pahl
Yes. CJ, I think, you know, on that front, we really don't spend a lot of time looking at the cycle, and our strongest indicator demand of course is the view that we get from orders and the forecast that we get from our consignment customers as they'll give us forecast. This forecast of course can change.
And, you know, we just turned in a good growth year on year. If you look at the year-on-year growth, that's 6%, 8% without legacy wireless, continues to be -- continues to be strong, at the midpoint of the guidance range, yes. And so, you know, that's what -- that we believe all those indicators are showing us.
As I talked about before, things like, you know, we're building demand in the channel or downstream, it actually took inventory out of the channel as more of our distributors moved to consignment, and as the products that were on consignment actually grew faster than the other products. So we really, you know, for a little over four-and-a-half weeks of inventory that's in the channel, we consider that to be lean, but probably will be running in what is the more of a new normal range.
So those changes in inventory downstream because of the consignments that we've got are going to have less of an impact on our revenues as what they've had in the past.
So with that, we can go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll move to David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong – Wells Fargo
Thank you very much. Could you give us some idea of how your policy of returning the bulk of your cash to shareholders affects future acquisition policy? Do you have expectation, your acquisition activity will be relatively low or that you'll be working primarily in stock purchases?
Kevin March
Yeah. David, I think the way to think about it, it relates - it kind of goes back a bit to a question that was asked earlier about, I believe by Doug, on debt on the balance sheet, from an acquisition standpoint, again, we'll look at first the strategic bit, make sure it makes sense, and then second, to make sure the numbers actually work on the return on the invested capital that we put into it.
Beyond that, the way we'd pay for it is probably very similar to what we did this last time, when we bought National Semiconductor, we used some cash on hand but we actually released the strength of the balance sheet and went out to the bond market and issued quite a bit of debt which supported that acquisition.
As we slowly retire debt as we had been and continue to over the next foreseeable future, that just opens the balance sheet back up and makes it available again to take on debt if there's an attractive ROIC accretive acquisition out there. So that's where I would -- that's how I would think about the strategy going forward. I don't see any of our cash management strategy having any interference whatsoever with our ability to continue to acquire when it makes sense.
David Wong – Wells Fargo
Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from William Stein with Suntrust.
William Stein – Suntrust Humphrey Robinson
Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the good quarter and guide.
I'm hoping you might comment on the margin progression in the embedded segment. It seems to -- progressed a bit better and it looks to us as though perhaps the restructuring benefits that you're targeting are coming in a bit earlier than you previously expected.
Kevin March
Yeah. You're exactly right on that. They have started to come in a bit earlier than we planned, but we still have a long way to go. We will see additional benefit as we move in the second and third quarter, as we talked about -- excuse me, third and fourth quarters as we talked about earlier, as we see more of the costs begin to come out of there. But frankly while that's certainly helpful in moving the profit performance of that segment forward, it is not going to be done when that's over with. There's a lot more work to be done there, and work is really on the revenue growth side.
The operating profit clearly is below what we think the potential for that segment is, and that management team is very focused on driving results to get that profit up to where it should be. And really after the restructuring actions are complete by the end of this year, it's really going to be all about revenue growth. It actually has been a lot about revenue growth as evidenced by the fact that that business has successfully grown for seven quarters in a row on a year-over-year basis, and we expect to see more of that as we go forward. So that business can grow its way into cost structure [indiscernible] --
William Stein – Suntrust Humphrey Robinson
That's helpful. If I can follow up just a bit in that. I think there's one area of that business where you're kind of under-hitting relative to your weight in the industry, and that's micro-controllers. I know that you've invested in this area in the last year or two. I'm wondering if you can talk about, you know, the strategy in terms of products, end-markets, features that might lead to accelerating share gain in that category.
Dave Pahl
Yeah, maybe I'll make a comment, and if you'd like to add in, Kevin.
Yeah. Well, as you know, that's an area that we decided to step up investments going back several years ago now, back 2010, 2011, in that period. And the expansion of investments included both development teams to produce more products and begin to broaden the portfolio. And second is in application support, basically supporting customers and design-ins. So we feel really good about the progress that we've got. We have several years that we have gained share inside of micro-controllers.
I think that we still -- I think some industry analysts will have us at like a number six position inside of the market. So we've got plenty of room to go. And those are the types of markets that take a while to begin to get traction, and somewhat like a flywheel that you keep investing, keep making progress, and that progress begins to snowball.
From a product standpoint, we're really building out a broad portfolio. We're focused on catalog products, primarily going into industrial applications. You'll note inside of embedded processing we also have connectivity products. So there we support about a dozen different wireless standards. So we're getting very good traction and you can go to our website today and be able to find reference designs with micro-controllers ranging from $0.25 up to a couple of dollars using all of those different combinations of the connectivity products.
So we feel really good about the progress. As I said in the opening remarks, embedded processing has had seven quarters of year-on-year growth, and a big part of that is driven from micro-controllers.
Okay, thank you very much, Will. We can go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll move to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
Hi guys. Before my questions, also want to just pass on the congrats to Ron and to Dave on the promotion. Best of luck to both of you.
I guess, Kevin, one clarification for -- that I wanted to get from you if I could. What was the starting point off of which that $130 million in savings exiting this year was going to be achieved?
Kevin March
Ross, we announced that action with our first quarter result, and we took -- excuse me, the fourth quarter and first quarter results, as I recall. On our fourth quarter, we took the charge, and first quarter, for embedded processing. So that's the start there. In the second quarter we took the charge for the Japan restructuring. So it's a bit of a mixed start, if you will. So it'd be a little hard to do a direct correlation, but again the math you should be using is $130 million annualized savings by the time we end the year with 85% of it coming out of OpEx.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
Great. And I guess as my follow-up, in the past, and I don’t know if you guys are going to do this anymore now that you've started to split out the revenues in a different way, but in the past, in the middle of the year you would say what the revenues by end-market did midyear. Is that something that you can give us now?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, Ross, we're really just planning on getting those numbers on an annualized basis, as I answered Jim's question earlier, you know, we'll provide revenue on a quarterly basis, just a color on what's happened in each of the markets. And that's what we've decided to move to.
So with that, we can move to our next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Nicolaus
Yes. Thank you, Ron, and best wishes in your retirement.
First question, you talked a lot about strength being broad-based, but was there any segments of markets in Q3 that are relatively weak, you know, whether that's seasonal or even secular [ph]?
Dave Pahl
From an end-market standpoint, Tore, the only market that we saw a decline was in personal electronics, and that was -- I'm sorry, was it third quarter or second quarter?
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Nicolaus
Q3 guidance.
Dave Pahl
I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, again, I somewhat addressed that, that we're really not trying to get into the color by end-market or our product segments or that. We realty just focus on the top-line number overall.
Did you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Nicolaus
Yeah, that's fair. My follow-up is, did you have a change in your distribution strategy at all in the quarter, or are you planning it? I'm thinking, you know, are you going to go to certain customers more of a direct business or?
Dave Pahl
No. We haven't had any change in the quarter. I can't say that we had changes to our business arrangement with distributors, you know, on a periodic basis over the years. And for example, if we just go back a few years ago as an example, we implemented the consignment program with distribution. So now we've got more than half of our overall revenues supported by distribution. So they're going to continue to be a very important part of our business. We're focused on growing our revenues overall, which will mean growing our revenues with them. As we've invested in catalog products and in industrial markets, we want to work with the distributors to be able to broaden our reach with customers. So we will do things that will optimize both our resources and theirs, but any specifics of details that we've got going on with changes we just won't get into.
Okay? With that, we’ll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Thank you. We're going to take our next question from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Research.
Srini Pajjuri – CLSA Research
Thank you. Dave, just looking at the end-market breakdown one more time -- I apologize, I know this question has been asked several times. You gave us the year-on-year trends. Can you also talk about sequential trends from Q1 to Q2?
Dave Pahl
Sure, yeah. I think aside from the increase in calculators, communication, and personal electronics actually grew the most, and we did see a benefit in personal electronics, led by a strong quarter in PC and notebooks. We did see industrial, enterprise systems and automotive all contribute to the growth sequentially. So if you look underneath that, and industrial as an example, we had -- we've got over a dozen sectors inside of industrial. So with that we saw areas like factory automation, control, smart grid, motor drives [ph] drive that. In automotive, on a sequential basis, we had growth in all sectors overall, and that was led by ADAS. So those are the things that drove the revenue in the quarter sequentially.
Srini Pajjuri – CLSA Research
Okay, great. Thank you. And then on the connectivity fund [ph], Dave, I think you mentioned you participate in a number of different standards, if I recall correctly, you sold the smartphone business a while back. My question is, is there anything preventing you from participating in the wearables market, if you think about the watches, et cetera?
Dave Pahl
No. In fact, you know, you'll -- I actually wear some of those products to track my steps, and it has quite a bit of TI contact [ph] both from power management standpoint and other analog products, as well as connectivity. So the beauty of having a catalog portfolio is that the incremental cost to engage a customer, the tools and the support are all in place. So we can very readily and very easily support markets like that overall.
So thanks, Srini. We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
And the next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.
Ian Ing – MKM Partners
Yeah, thanks. Just a clarification on being opportunistic in acquisition of manufacturing assets. Are you -- is it for taking a long view on increasing capacity or are you removing bottlenecks in the manufacturing flow? It looks like Richardson and analog, there's still a lot of headroom here.
Kevin March
Yeah, Ian, it can be a little bit of both. If we see bottlenecks popping up some place and we're able to go ahead and pick up equipment inexpensively, or if we anticipate that a flow is going to become a bigger, more important revenue source in the future, we can go ahead and pick up for that. Or just outright new factories for example, and what's what we did when we bought the assembly test site in Chengdu, China. It was an entire that we had bought in that case.
So we'll play -- we'll take advantage whatever opportunity presents itself, especially if the finances are compelling.
Ian Ing – MKM Partners
Great. And this commentary on connectivity growing faster within embedded, I'm assuming, you know, we're talking about internet of things and wearables, sockets [ph] that could attach with micro-controllers and power management, and do you have a sense of IOT [ph] mix, how much of it is more like industrial, military, first responder type of applications with long cycles?
Dave Pahl
Yeah, if you look at our -- the product portfolio, we actually support a dozen or so different wireless technologies, so, whether you need Bluetooth flow energy or WiFi, we've got GPS, we have multiple sub gigahertz standards, including things like ZigBee. So whatever label that you want to put on to that, essentially if things are getting smarter and more connected, we've got a broad range of catalog products in which to show the customers, and we can be fairly agnostic on how to solve their problem and bring really the best bit of the technology to whatever markets they're trying to enter. And oftentimes we'll find manufacturers that have, you know, never had any wireless experience, so they'll want to go to the web, they'll want to contact our local apps people, and get support for that product, and they really don't have to become RF experts. And so they can focus their time on other things. And that's a combination that's working real well.
Okay. With that, we can go to the next caller please.
Operator
And the next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Caso – Susquehanna Financial Group
Yes, thank you. I wonder if I could go back to some of your earlier comments with regard to the consignment revenue. I guess just to clarify that, I guess what you're saying is the higher percentage of fulfillment through consignment that you're expecting for third quarter is what's pulling down the book-to-bill. And I think in the past you've talked about your book-to-bill for the non-consignment portion of your business. Could you tell us what is and perhaps that's a better indicator of the end-market booking trends?
Kevin March
Yeah, on the -- what I talked about, Chris, was that we've had a conversion of more products into consignment going to distribution. And so that suppressed the book-to-bill a little bit that we just came out of the quarter with.
If you keep in mind that -- oh gosh, how much of our revenue is going through consignment now? Probably 50% for the total company is going through consignment. What that really means is that book-to-bill for that consignment revenue is by definition one. And so the book-to-bill that we reported at the company level really just applies to the other half of the revenue. So that 1.01 that we just reported in very simple terms will be 1.02 because it really applies to non-consignment portion of the business. And again that was suppressed somewhat as a result of a conversion from a previously directly sale to a consigned arrangement.
Dave Pahl
Yeah. And Chris, I’ll just add, in second quarter, you know, we delivered a 10% sequential growth and our book-to-bill was 1.03. You know, if you look at orders, they were up 9% sequentially. So, you know, that book-to-bill number is just one number, and as Kevin said, it's got some noise in it. So it's one consideration that we look at as we put together the demand forecast.
You have a follow-on, Chris?
Chris Caso – Susquehanna Financial Group
Yes, sure. For my follow-on, I guess I'll ask a little bit of a bigger picture question. TI over the years has always been a cyclical company, just the function of the industry. But as you guys are operating the business a little bit differently now, your focus is on some different end-markets. Just interested in your view of, you know, going forward, what does that do to the cyclicality of TI as we go over the next couple of years?
Kevin March
Yeah, I think you're spot-on, Chris. As you look at the mix of what's going on inside our portfolio, in years past, as you observed, we had some big verticals, certain end-markets you might be able to take a look at, and our business cycle with that end-market in addition to any so-called semiconductor cycle itself.
Now as we have industrial and automotive becoming a larger and larger percentage of our total revenue and the market to which our products are being shipped into, arguably we would see -- likely see less impact as a result of big vertical fluctuations and begin to see a little bit more correlation between TI's growth going forward and the global GDP as a whole. So we'll probably track more to the economy as opposed to a particular single end-market.
That's not to say that we escaped the semi-cycle if there still is one. It's simply to say that our fortunes are more tied much more broadly than they have been ever in the past, and therefore they're much more reflective of, you know, how does the overall global GDP tend to expand over time.
Dave Pahl
Okay. And with that, operator, we have time for one last caller.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.
Timothy Arcuri – Cowen & Co.
Thanks so much. Guys, based on your current schedule of depreciation, and if you assume that CapEx remains at roughly 4% of sales, when is depreciation going to hit the level of CapEx? Is this is a 2016 event or is this sometime beyond that?
Kevin March
Yeah, Tim, it's unlikely that we would see CapEx and depreciation converge prior to 2016. So that's probably a good starting point for you to build your models with.
Dave Pahl
You have a follow-on, Tim?
Timothy Arcuri – Cowen & Co.
Okay, great. Okay, great. And then a question about gross margin drop-through. You know, the number has been a little bit above 75% the last couple of quarters. But is that still the right number to think about going forward for the gross margin drop-through? I know people were talking about operating margin drop-through, but I'm wondering about gross margin drop-through. Thanks.
Kevin March
Well, certainly we're operating at a higher level now, Tim, than we have in years past. And we talked a number of years ago about a long-term -- a long window of time that that fall-through during the course of a business cycle historically has been a pretty good indicator to follow. But in any one time period, it's always been -- it doesn't really apply very well.
More importantly, going forward we'll operate into much higher level of gross than we have ever in the past, and I would expect that to continue to drop through quite richly, and importantly, drop through as free cash flow, that we can continue to return to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buyback.
Dave Pahl
Okay, great. And with that, I will turn it over to Ron to make some final remarks.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. As we wrap this up, let me just close by saying the past 32 years working at TI really has been a good -- I'd say great ride.
For Dave and Kevin, let me simply pass on the request and words of advice that had been passed down from generations of TI managers, and that, please don't screw it up.
Thank you all for joining us. A replay of the call is available on our website. Good evening.
Operator
That does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
The first quarter was a good start to the year for TI. Our positions in analog and embedded processing contributed strongly, with combined revenue for these products up 13% from a year ago. As important markets such as industrial and automotive continued to embrace electronics technology, analog and embedded processing products are critical and TI should benefit accordingly. 
Revenue of $2.98 billion was in the upper half of our expected range that we communicated in January. Earnings per share of $0.44 was at the top of our expected range. EPS included $0.02 that was not in our prior guidance from sales of a site and other assets associated with previously announced restructuring actions.
Free cash flow was $3.1 billion or 25% of revenue for the trailing 12 months period, right in line with the 20% to 30% range where we expect to operate over time. For those of you who missed our capital management call in March, we raised our expected range for free cash flow margins from 20% to 25% to 20% to 30% in that call. Also over the past 12 months, we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. In the March call, Kevin explained that our updated model for cash returns to shareholders was to return all of our free cash flow less the net debt amount that is retired plus proceeds that we received from exercises of equity compensation. Inclusion of the exercise proceeds was a new addition to the model from what we had previously communicated. Against this targeted return level, we returned 99% over the past 12 months.
In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 3% from a year ago. Excluding legacy wireless, revenue grew 11% with double digit growth in both analog and embedded processing. Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago with all four major product lines up. Power management and high performance analog led this growth, and were each up about the same amount.
Embedded processing revenue grew 17% from a year ago with micro-controllers leading the way. Our increased investments in this growth area over the past few years are yielding favorable results. 
In our other segment, revenue declined $186 million or 28% from a year ago due to legacy wireless which has now declined to the single digit millions of dollars. 
Turning to distribution, Resales increased 10% from a year ago, while distributors’ inventory remained about the same and it’s just under five and a half weeks. From an end market perspective, the most growth from a year ago came from communications equipment, followed by industrial and automotive. 
Enterprise Systems was about even, while revenue in personal electronics declined due to mobile phones and tablets, areas that previously used legacy wireless products from TI. 
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. 
Kevin March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.61 billion or 53.9% of revenue. Gross profit increased 17% from the year ago quarter. This was a solid increase in profitability, considering the 3% growth in total revenue. The 630 basis point expansion in gross margin as a percentage of revenue reflects an improved product portfolio, higher utilization of our manufacturing assets and the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. 
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $845 million was down $33 million from a year ago. The decline reflects restructuring associated with the wind down of our legacy wireless products. As a reminder, we will begin to see the benefit of the previously announced restructuring in a better processing and Japan in the second half of this year. While we are discontinuing R&D spending in the areas that are no longer able to provide differentiated growth, we continue to invest aggressively in those areas that are providing growth such as analogue where we’ve increased our R&D investments by 77% since 2006, resulting in steady increases in market share. Or as Ron mentioned, more recently with our stepped up investments in embedded processing, which is now resulting in multiple quarters of year over year revenue growth. 
Moving on, acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which is the ongoing amortization of intangibles and non-cash expense. Restructuring and other charges included a charge of $32 million for the previously announced restructuring about as we expected. There was also a gain $37 million for sales of the site and other assets associated with earlier restructuring actions. As Ron mentioned, this gain contributed $0.2 to EPS in the quarter and was not included in our prior guidance.
Operating profit was $690 million or 23.1% of revenue. Operating profit was up 75% from the year ago. Again, this was a solid increase considering total revenue was up 3% over this period. Net income in the first quarter was $487 million or 0.44 per share. 
Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $462 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 112, consistent with our model of 105 days to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $77 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 months basis, cash flow from operations was $3.49 billion, up 5% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $405 million or 3% of revenue. Capital spending for the year ago trailing 12 month period was $476 million or 4% of revenue. Consequently, free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.08 billion or 25% of revenue in the middle of our expected 20% to 30% range. This is 8% higher than the free cash flow was a year ago when it was 23% of revenue. 
Depreciation expense for the past 12 months was $864 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $459 million or 3.7% of revenue. Our strategy to opportunistically time our purchases of manufacturing equipment has provided us a manufacturing capability today that has sufficient headroom to support growth for years ahead. Our current level of capital expenditures, provide us with important new manufacturing technologies while also continuing to expand our capacity. Over the next few years, as a result of this strategy, we expect to continue to hold capital spending at low levels or at about 4% of revenue. Therefore depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margin will directly benefit. 
As we have said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. In the first quarter, TI paid $325 million in dividends and repurchased $720 million of our stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Historically we have described our capital management strategy was to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders except for what we need to repay debt. In March we updated this model to also include the return of proceeds that we received from the exercise of equity compensation. In the past 12 months, free cash flow was $3.08 billion. 
Our debt level was essentially unchanged and we received $1.14 billion of proceeds from exercises. So our target of return model would be about $4.22 billion. We actually returned $4.18 billion to shareholders on a 99% of the model. So our recent practice has been well [aligned] with the updated model. This percentage will likely move up in the second quarter as we retire debt that is due in May. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was 38% higher than a year ago. 
Dividends were up 48% and stock repurchases were up 34%. Fundamental for our cash strategy and our cash management, are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $4.03 billion of cash and short term investments, with 84% of that amount owned by TI’s U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely on-shore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. As a reminder, we issued $500 million of debt in the first quarter at an average coupon rate of 1.8% for three and seven year terms. And we plan to retire $1 billion when it comes due in May. 
TI’s orders in the quarter were $3.07 billion up 4% from a year ago and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.03. 
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.14 billion to $3.40 billion in the second quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. If you exclude the $148 million of legacy wireless revenue from the year ago quarter, revenue would increase 13%. We expect second-quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.63. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil and acquisition charges will remain about even which is a non-cash amortization charge that will be at this level for the next five years. We have revised our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 to 28%, up a point from our prior estimate, reflecting our high expectation for profitability in the year. This is the tax rate that you should use for the second quarter.
In summary, I think the first quarter provided a glimpse into the potential financial performance that TI should be capable of going forward. Our Analog and Embedded Processing product lines will benefit as the industrial and automotive markets continue to increasingly embrace technology. These are markets where we’re investing that offer the promise of sustainable growth, solid profitability and good cash flow from operations. The low capital requirements for Analog and Embedded Processing, combined with our strategy to opportunistically acquire manufacturing assets, also means that we can deliver strong free cash flows, which would allow us to continue to provide strong returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

2014-04-24,Q&A," Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) and we go first to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse.
Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me open the questioning. Congratulations on the strong results. Kevin, helpful on giving us topline and bottom line guiding for the June quarter. I’m just kind of curious, as we think about gross margin and OpEx, how does the OpEx saving kind of [linearly] fold into the model between now and December? And on the gross margin lines, should we just think about sort of that 75% historical incremental gross margin against revenue growth?
Kevin March
So John, let me start with the OpEx. As you look into the next quarter in particular, recall that in the ... just to step back for a moment. On an annual basis, we typically have our pay and benefit increases occurring in the first quarter. And typically, two of the three months of the first quarter will incur that increase. So clearly as we go into second quarter, we’ll have a full three months of that increase. But to the point that you were bringing up on some of the savings that we’ll see from the restructuring in Embedded Processing actions, we’ll see a little bit of that savings begin to materialize in the second quarter. So OpEx will probably be fairly flat. The majority of that savings will occur in the second half of the year. And just to remind everyone else, we’re expecting about $130 million in annualized savings as a result of that announced restructuring. On the gross profit, it’s exactly as you said John. You should be thinking that over the course of the cycle, our fall through average is about on the way up and on the way down. So that’s a good long term model to be using as you build your model. 
Ron Slaymaker
Follow on, John?
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities
Yeah. Ron, maybe you can help me out a bit. Given the reclassification of revenue you guys did, I’m just kind of curios, how does a mix influence gross margin? And if you think about the new buckets of revenue, where do you expect to see faster, longer term growth versus slower, longer term growth, either by design or just by market forces? 
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. And when you talk about our reclassification of revenue, are you talking about by end market or are you talking by -_
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities
By end markets specifically, Ron. Thank you. 
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Even though was end market, let me first of all address that more by product line. So the biggest mix change has been as we’ve gotten out of legacy wireless. And even though that’s essentially zero as of first quarter, you’ll still see the impact on the year-on-year comparison through the course of 2014. And in general the legacy wireless gross margins were lower than corporate average. So getting out of that, those product areas was beneficial to gross margin. From and end marker stand point probably the way to think about it is that gross margins tend to be highest and this is not unique to TI; you can just look across a broader range of companies, but gross margins tend to be highest where volumes tend to be lowest. 
Meaning where -- maybe the better way to say it is where the revenue is most diversified across customers and application areas so for example, industrial. You can see other companies that are highly focused on industrial and we see it in our own results where you’re selling catalogue products into lots and lots of different customers and different applications within the industrial space and that tends to be at pretty nice gross margins. Other areas like automotive where there are a lot of special requirements from the standpoint of quality, the design end cycles tend to be long. The product life cycle both in automotive and in industrial tend to be long and that tends to be beneficial for gross margins also. 
They probably tend to be lowest in the short cycle, high volume end market areas and that’s partly the nature of the competitiveness of those opportunities, combined with you don’t really have time in terms of the life cycle of the product to engineer in cost reductions, to get gross margins where you would really like to see them over time. And so there’s lots of examples of that and again you see it in our own results and you would see it probably more broadly with other companies. So if you say where you would expect to see highest growth over time, I would say just make a couple of observations. 
I think both industrial and automotive from an application area, from their embracement of electronics technology, they’re at a tipping point where those very likely will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets going forward just by nature of the provision of semiconductor technology inside those applications. Now I would also say that we have a good position in those markets and we believe analogue and embedded are important. And we also believe frankly our sales force and the breadth sales force is an important competitive advantage for TI in reaching especially in the industrial markets, a broad base of customers there. 
So probably not surprisingly and you’ve heard us say for some time now, they are priority areas for TI in terms of investment and in terms of our expected penetration into those markets and applications. And that doesn’t necessarily mean that their revenue will grow faster as a percentage of TI’s total because you never know what will happen in a particular high volume market. But over time I think you would expect that our position in those markets get stronger and over time the percent of our revenue that is coming from industrial and automotive will continue to grow as well. 
Okay. John, thanks for the questions and let’s move to the next caller. 
Operator
And we move next to Mark Lipacis with Jeffrey’s.
Mark Lipacis – Jefferies & Company
Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I apologize if I’m asking you to repeat what you’ve read in your script, but could you just walk through the mechanics of the capital return for this quarter? You have the debt that you’re going to pay down, but you issued some. So I understand that the free cash flow plus the proceeds from the options minus the debt services is what you expect to return. So if you have $1 billion, do we just subtract that $1 billion or do we also factor in the $500 million in debt that you issued this quarter as part of that pay down?
Kevin March
Mark, let me try to get to the way you’re trying to ask that question. Again at the high level, I’ll repeat what you said there. Our cash return strategy is to return 100% of the free cash flow, less any amount used for net debt retirement plus proceeds that we get from stock option exercises. During this past quarter or during this past 12 months, there was virtually no net debt retirement. So it was really the proceeds from free cash flow plus the stock option exercises was virtually all -- we returned all of that to the shareholders in the last 12 months, 99% of that to the shareholders. 
As you move into second quarter, we do have $1 billion of debt that’s coming due on May that we’ll go ahead and pay off. And so when you re-run that math, you’ll see some usage over that trailing 12 months of cash for debt retirement. And just mathematically that says the percentage we return by the time we get to the end of second quarter will probably be in excess of 100%, probably in excess of 110%. But that’s just timing and as you go through the course of the year that will net itself as we move on through the year.
Mark Lipacis – Jefferies & Company
Let me just ask a clarification, Kevin. So in a quarter where you pay down debt, does that immediately come right out of repurchases or is it a more smoothing type of application in terms of the way you look at the return formula?
Kevin March
It’s a more smoothing type of application. It will not affect the timing of our repurchases. We will continue to do repurchases, as you’ve seen us in the past, which is a very steady hand, constant hand as we go through time. And we don’t try to time our repurchases. We just try to be very steady and methodical about it. 
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow up, Mark?
Mark Lipacis – Jefferies & Company
Yeah, I did and thanks for asking that clarification, Ron. I appreciate that. In trying to model the cash flows through the year, normally you have Q1. You have accounts payable and accounts receivable are a big use of cash, which they were this quarter and then in Q4 accounts receivable becomes a nice source of cash. Is it fair to assume that that typical pattern is what we would expect to see? And is there any other working capital shifts that might happen this year that’s different than what you’ve historically had? Thank you.
Kevin March
Mark, I think you’ve identified that quite well. Typically our first and second quarters are our lowest for cash flow and operating cash flow and free flow cash generation. First quarter we had pay and benefit increases as I mentioned earlier. We also pay out our profit share and our performance bonuses during the first quarter. Then the second quarter, we of course have estimated tax payments that we have to make for the year that uses some cash, but as we travel through the year, our operating cash and our free cash flow have a tendency to increase, first to second to third to fourth and then decline again. And I don’t see anything in 2014 that would suggest that would be any different than what we’ve seen for a number of years now.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay Mark. Thank you for your question. Let’s move to the next caller. 
Operator
We move to Doug Freedman with RBC
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets
Hi guys. Congrats on the strong results and thanks for letting me ask a question. If I could, could you dig into a little bit what you’re seeing in terms of the mix of product, whether it be ASPs units, and then a little bit of insight into maybe your back log , what you’re seeing in lead times book-to-bill and maybe the projected turns that you need to meet the mid-point?
Kevin March
I can maybe give you a little bit on that. In terms of ASPs Mark, Doug, excuses me, I’m really not aware that there’s been any significant shift one way or the other. And again that just tends to shift that take place on ASPs when you have differentiated products such as we do, tend to be more driven by mix than they would general pricing environment you might say or a competitive pricing environment. Again no substantial shift there other than when you look over time on, the longer term impact of moving out of legacy wireless. Lead times are generally stable. At any point in time you always have some mixed differences that might cause lead times to move in or out for one product area versus another. But generally lead times are stable and for TI what that means is the majority of our products are shipping with lead times of less than six weeks.
Ron Slaymaker 
I’ll comment on backlog. Doug, you asked about that. We came into last quarter with a book-to-bill of 0.94 and we’ve come into this quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.03. So clearly we’ve got a little bit more visibility than we had last quarter or even the quarter before that. Just to put that in perspective, orders in the quarter -- I think we mentioned earlier we are up about 4% year over year. That works out to being up about 7% quarter over quarter. So with those combined elements from a backlog standpoint, that leads to expect that we will have pretty reasonable growth in total revenues as we go in second quarter as indicated by the guidance that we’ve included with this release. 
Kevin March 
And I know I’ve said this before, but let me just remind you that with the 1.03 book-to-bill, today about 45% of our revenue is supported by consignment and JIT programs. And so for that revenue, book-to-bill is always 1.0. So the 1.03 is a blend of really only the revenue that’s non-JIT or non-consignment which is 55% of our revenue. So if I just round and call that half of our revenue, the book-to-bill on those products that would be shipping on traditional backlog and order entry type process would be more like a 1.06, the total being a 1.03 because that 1.06 then gets blended with the JIT consignment products at a 1.0 book-to-bill. 
Ron Slaymaker 
Okay. Hopefully that helped and didn’t further confuse. Did you have a follow on, Doug?
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets
Great. Thanks Ron. No. That was excellent color, I really do appreciate it. My follow on is really about sort of the cost of running the business. I know that you guys have executed your restructuring plan to lower some of the cost, but how should I think about the cost in OpEx going forward in relation to say revenue growth? If revenue growth continues at say double digit pace, does the core OpEx grow with that same double digit pace or is there some leverage there?
Kevin March 
Yeah. Doug, I think that we do have some leverage certainly in 2014 and that is the restructuring that we announced in [beta] processing and Japan. That mostly will kick in during the second half. So again just to remind you, that’s $130 million of annualized savings that we expect to capture by the end of the year. So as we roll into next year we’ll see it on an annual basis. That $130 million will spread roughly 65% in R&D, 20% in SG&A and the balance of 15% in cost of revenue and cost of goods sold. So we’re kind of spread that way. Beyond 2014, again I think we’ve commented a couple of times on prior calls our basic model for OpEx is to operate between 20% and 30% of revenue. So it will not go up or down necessarily at the same pace that revenue goes up or down. It will be more of a steady change over time, but some of these one off anomalies like I just described with the restructuring going on in a [beta] processing and Japan. 
Ron Slaymaker 
Okay. Doug, thank you. Let’s move to the next caller.

We move to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan Securities 
Can you give us your thoughts on the relative growth rates of your analogue versus embedded versus your -- I guess your other category this year? And then maybe talk about just the various puts and takes of why embedded was up so much, analogue was up a little bit less and the other was down so much this quarter? 
Ron Slaymaker 
Chris, are you asking for comments on forward looking or kind of why the historical results were what they were?
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan Securities
Both will be great. If I had to choose one I’d say forward, but both would be great. 
Ron Slaymaker 
Okay. Forward will be short discussion because we have -- really I can say legacy wireless will continue down through the rest of this year when compared against the year ago period. But it’s zero already. So I think the reality is it’ll be what it’ll be. You’ll see certain times when Analog grows faster than Embedded. You’ll see periods where Embedded grows faster than Analog. I think Kevin even in his opening remarks mentioned that. I think it was back in 2010 where we stepped up investments in Embedded because we believed there was a great growth opportunity for TI and microcontrollers. We have answered questions from you guys for a long time about where’s the growth that goes along with that stepped up investment. And frankly I think we’re starting to see it now. 
It make sense because it takes time first of all for that R&D to translate to products and then for products to get designed into customers and them to get their products to the market. I think what we’re seeing now in Embedded, very specifically in the micro controller area has to do with the stepped up investments that we made a few years ago in microcontrollers. Certainly also what’s helping Embedded is I think we mentioned that from an end market standpoint, we’re seeing strength in communications equipment as well. And clearly the DSP position, our processor position we have in Embedded across pretty much all of the various OEM’S that ship into that wireless base station market are benefiting now in terms of that market starting to lift for us. 
In terms of Analog, the same thing. You’ll see over time periods where power grows faster. In fact probably that would be a trend that you’d say if you look over an extended period of time, meaning five years or so power has pretty consistently led growth in Analog. And we think that’s an opportunity that will just continue in the years ahead. That has to do with the world wanting to get greener in terms of power efficiency and it has to do with a lot more products in the end market becoming battery power and that’s a great power management opportunity for TI. Our leadership in that market means that as that market lifts, we probably tend to lift more than most other players.
Outside of that, what we’re doing in Silicon Valley Analog, what we’re doing in high performance Analog, both those areas in the industrial market are very clear beneficiaries of the industrial market continuing to lift. So I’ll stop there. Those are some general comments. But again we don’t really try to mention it, Chris. We have certain areas like industrial and automotive that are important to us, but frankly pretty much every product area, whether it’s application specific products or processors or catalogue analog devices can reach into industrial and can reach into automotive and be beneficiaries of that strategy going forward. 
Do you have a follow on, Chris?
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan Securities
Yeah and I hopped on a little late. So I’m sorry if you already talked about it. But can you just go over what utilization rates were during the quarter, what you’re expecting them to be this quarter? And then given all the restructuring and fads et cetera, maybe just refresh us on what your sort of peak revenue level is and where you would need to start adding equipment in terms of a utilization level?
Kevin March 
Chris, on utilization again we haven’t disclosed the actual percentage utilization in quite some time. We tend to do that when it’s really a dramatic change, it’s informative. I will just say that our factory utilization from a stats basis was higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter, but the average wafers that moved through the factories was about the same in both quarters. So, consequently the underutilization charge was the same in both quarters, both fourth quarter and first quarter at about $105 million. With the outlook that we have for the second quarter with the guidance that we’ve offered, clearly we have been and we’ll continue to increase the loadings in the factories to support the increased expected outlook revenue growth in the second quarter.
And then just to the last part of your question there, the installed capacity that we have today is equipped to the point to support we believe about $18 billion of revenue. As we go forward, we’ll continue to look for opportunities to increase capacity at the lowest possible cost as we have done for a number of years now so that we can remain focused on maximizing continuous free cash flow over time as opposed to trying to maximize factory utilization levels over time. 
Ron Slaymaker

We’ll move next to Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit Shah – Nomura Securities
Yeah. Hi guys. Thanks. So I was just jumping on here a little bit late, but I noticed the guidance for EPS growth is significantly higher than revenue growth. is capacity utilization -- Kevin I know you’re not going to give us gross margin guidance, but is utilization the biggest factor driving the fast earnings growth?
Kevin March
I presume that you’re talking in relation to the sequential growth when you’re asking that?
Romit Shah – Nomura Securities
Yeah, in relation to Q1.
Kevin March
Yeah. I think you’re going to see -- certainly you get some EPS growth just off the revenue growth itself. You will see some improvement on utilization. As I mentioned a moment ago, we’re increasing the loadings in the factories. But you’ll also see a similar improvement as you go to the next quarter just on lower manufacturing cost. Recall a couple of years ago that we had announced that we were closing two older six inch factories, one in Houston and one in Hiji, Japan and those basically are behind us now. And so that cost saving is finding its way through. So you’ve got a couple moving parts going on inside there. 
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow on, Romit?
Romit Shah – Nomura Securities
Yeah and can you just talk a little about the impact of OpEx on EPS during the second quarter as well? Thank you.

We move to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
Thanks for letting me ask a question. Ron, a couple of quarters ago there was a lot of talk about seasonality and what that was going to be going forward and I think you chose a three year average for your sequentials in the fourth quarter. As we look forward is that still as good a boggy as any for the June quarter? And from a sequential perspective by my math, that yields about 8% up. You’re guiding above that. What’s better than seasonal in what you guys are seeing? 
Ron Slaymaker
Ross, I think two months after we gave you that number in fourth quarter, we then started to decline to provide it again. And the reality is seasonality, the number you come up with for call it an average growth for any particularly quarter, will vary so widely based upon the time period that you used to collect that. And so we’ve decided is instead of us giving you our view -- we’ve historically provided – call it a three year or five average, five year, whatever. The reality is when we threw that number out, it was being perceived as an endorsement of that level of growth for TI and that was never our intentions. 
So I think what we’ve decided to do going forward is just let you guys go through that analysis and provide your own estimates on seasonality. If you need help with the math on whether it’s a three year or a five year average, I probably could help on that, but I’m not going to do it for you. The other thing is and I’ve noted even just looking at reports coming into this current report, I think sell-side analysts I saw had anywhere from call it 4% average for second quarter sequential to up to 9% . And again, that just reinforces that the range is so wide that from our perspective internally, we really just don’t put much emphasis on seasonal average given how wide that range is. If you think it’s important, then we’re going to let you go through that on your own. 
Do you have a follow on, Ross?
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
Sure. Maybe I’ll be a little more successful with this one. Embedded Processing seemed like that was the segment that provided the upside in the quarter that you just reported. As you think about the microcontroller areas starting to deliver growth given the prior investments that you’ve made, can you give us a little bit of color on some of the applications that are driving that growth? And really why did they start taking off finally now? And maybe looking forward what’s the road map from an end market perspective and application? Anything that can give us a little color in helping us to channel check that segment would be helpful. 
Ron Slaymaker 
I’d offer a couple of things. Microcontrollers; the beauty of microcontrollers is they tend not to -- they are so, so diversified across applications. And so good luck on that channel check, but they’re very much so in industrial applications. Certainly automotive is a factor there. The other piece that I would mention for embedded processing that I already mentioned was communications equipment. Base stations clearly was a lift for TI. The only thing I would caution against is the view that that would draw some significant upside, because the reality is I think for most part analogue and embedded processing came in about as expected. And in fact our revenue overall I think we’re 1% or so above the midpoint of our guidance range. So again the quarter generally came in about as we expected. But what drove the strength there would probably be a mix of industrial, automotive microcontroller applications as well as communications equipment. But pretty much everything was broadly up in the quarter. 
I guess that was your follow up, Ross. Thank you and we’ll move to the next caller.

We move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. 
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital
Guys, can you hear me now? 
Ron Slaymaker
We can hear you now. 
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital
Hey. Perfect, sorry about that. So I apologize also if you mentioned this earlier, but just on the outlook for June, outside of calculators, were there any outliers in terms of products either up or down in your outlook?
Kevin March 
Blayne, we don’t specifically break our forecast out into particular end markets or product areas. But I think what I would be safe in saying is that it’s a pretty broad based traction that is taking place in second quarter and it’s driving that growth. That doesn’t mean everything is up uniformly the same but it is -- we believe the strength will be pretty broad based for us. And as you pointed out, calculators probably is the one outlier where it just tends to have a good back to school strength in the second quarter and we do expect that as well this second quarter. 
Ron Slaymaker 
Do you have a follow on, Blayne? 
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital
Yeah. In terms of your restructuring effort that you’ve talked about come, I was just wondering if you’ve taken any other actions now there are product lines. Particularly microcontrollers seems like an area of investment. Have you kind of reallocated any resources there or any color on if there is any other segments that you’ve paired back on spending? Thanks.
Kevin March
Blayne, last quarter when we discussed the restructuring efforts that we were taking, we included the discussion of embedded processing in Japan. So Japan is clearly one that is underway. It will be complete for the most part by the end of the second quarter or at the end of second quarter. And that was really to resize our presence in Japan principally from a support standpoint to be more commensurate with the size of the market opportunity there. As it relates to embedded processing, we did discuss that we were in some cases reducing investments or discontinuing on some areas that were no longer showing growth opportunities and other cases reallocating. And that affected our processor side as well as our microcontroller side to a lesser degree in Embedded Processing. Beyond those, there’s no other actions that we’ve taken or intend to take that we’d discuss right now. 
Ron Slaymaker 
Okay. Blayne, thanks for your questions. I’m glad you were able to circle back in and let’s move to the next caller.

Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company
Hi, thanks. Can you just talk about from a big picture perspective, can you -- I don’t know if you tried to segment out how much of your revenue is directly related to internet of things. But can you try to give us some sense of the percentage of the revenue that’s related to IOT what with a in a large semi-conductor company actually creating that as is independent segment? Thanks.
Ron Slaymaker 
Boy Tim, we really don’t and frankly we saw in all the hype that the realm the term internet of things. I think if you look at our capability and market position, it probably is second to none. If you look across processors, microcontrollers that are just inherent in connecting the world. Combine that with our connectivity capability whether Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, those types of capabilities that we have in our embedded business as well. That potential to then go pursue that opportunity of connecting lots of different things, I think is probably second to none. But that being said, as soon as the world goes and puts a big label on it and tries to calculate how much everybody has and this and that, that’s really not what we are interested in. We love the diversity of what you are calling internet of things, meaning if lots of different applications, they have different requirements, they are across different customers, the idea of somehow circling it up into a common end market or whatever we think is probably the wrong approach just because there’s not that much in common there from a technology standpoint or from a customer or an end market standpoint. But again, we’ll just try to stay away from the hype. We’ll keep our heads down and go attack that opportunity. 
Do you have a follow on, Tim?
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company
I did actually, yeah. Sorry, I actually jumped on late, but you might have already talked about this, but can you address the channel inventory, either your inventory, and also inventory in the channel and also maybe remind us of what normal seasonal is for Q3? Thanks. 
Ron Slaymaker
We did hit on some of those things. I’ll say channel inventory for TI we described as less than five and a half weeks, really unchanged from where it’s been for some time now. And I would just say if you look more broadly, we think inventory that we would characterize that as lean. We would characterize customer inventory as lean. Maybe one of the best data points is cancellations from customers are incredibly low right now and we think that reflects a combination of lean inventories as well as the growing demand environment that we are in. But I think both the other pieces there we did address already. 
Okay Tim, thanks for your questions. We’ll move to the next caller please.

We move to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. I’m going to just ask one with no follow ups since a lot of good questions have been asked. You guys had broken out as you usually do your segments at the beginning of the year in terms of end market exposure. I think it was 37% was consumer. Kind of a longer term question, is that a number you are comfortable with or is that a number that you’d like to see decline over time through market share growth in segments? Obviously consumer I don’t think is growing as fast on a revenue basis as some of the other markets over time because of pricing pressure and such there. So just a little perspective on where you would like to see that number three years from now? Thanks a lot.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thanks Jim, and that’s a good question. So let me do a couple of things. I’ll also give a little bit of the color of what happened in quarter by end market because nobody has asked that question. But very clearly we do talk about the one end market being personal electronics and in 2013 that was 37% of our revenue. That is not what you would historically or typically think of as consumer though. It does have products like gaming products in there. It has television in there, set top box, but it also includes mobile phones, notebook computers, printers and also things like tablets. And so it will go down between 2013 and 2014 largely because of our exit from legacy wireless. 
So, most of that revenue would have been shipping into the personal electronics space. But again don’t -- and I’ve had a number of questions from analysts over the last few months that imply that a people think of personal electronics as consumer. It’s not. It’s again mobile phones, notebooks and that space as well. They do tend to be consumer buying decisions as opposed to enterprise, but they are not what you’ve typically thought of in past as consumer electronic. So I think in the prepared remarks we gave a top level overview of what drove revenue from a year ago. Maybe I can give a little more granularity on that. So I think we talked about communications equipment being the highest contributor of growth from a year ago. 
That very clearly tied to wireless infrastructure. Next we said industrial. Interestingly industrial, if you go out to our website, we break that down into multiple sectors, something like 12, 15 different sectors below the industrial level. Pretty much all of them were up in that year-on-year comparison, with most of them up at a double digit growth level, so good strength and broad strength in industrial. Automotive, similarly. If you go look at the sectors on our website, all of them were up. Infotainment products were the strongest, but all of the sectors inside automotive were up. 
Enterprise Systems we said were about even for TI and that really is a combination of growth in projector revenue, which again is primarily DLP for TI, offset by declines in servers and then the last area which we started off with on personal electronics. It was down, but it was down pretty much only due to legacy wireless. If you would have excluded the legacy wireless revenue out of that comparison, then personal electronics would have been about even from a year ago. So again that’s just a little more color of what happened inside there.
Jim, thank you for your questions and let’s move to the next caller.

We move to Vivek Arya with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - Banc of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. When I look at your first half growth in Analog and Embedded, I think it’s almost 13%, 14% year-on-year. Very strong, well above what we’ve seen from most of the peer group so far. Are you worried at all about double ordering anything that suggests that trends could sail off in the second half? Do you have enough visibility in the second half, whether it will be roughly seasonal? Not anything that suggests that the trends are sustainable versus not. 
Ron Slaymaker
I’ll make up a comment and Kevin if you have anything to add certainly jumps in. Vivek, we’re not seeing at this point signs of that kind of overheated market. Typically that comes along with crazy expedites and things like that that frankly we just didn’t see in the quarter. We saw customers giving us good visibility into their needs. We’ve been shipping at the lead times that we’ve been quoting them and our lead times have been stable. In that environment typically, there’s no need for customers to start that double ordering process that you mentioned. So again we really see no signs of that taking place. In terms of visibility in the second half, again we’ve got customers for the most part trying to give us visibility into their needs. But I would really not say we have -- I would not want to try to provide any specific comments about second half visibility at this point. Kevin, do you have any other comment?
Kevin March
Not much different than what you’re saying. I would looking over the numbers here go back to your point. We did have 13% year over year growth in the first quarter when you combine Analog and Embedded processing. That’s up just a bit from last quarter when it was 12% year-over-year and up a little bit from the prior quarter when it was up to 7% year-over-year. What we’re actually seeing is a slight acceleration in that to it looks like the low teens. And that’s probably consistent with what we talked about at the last earnings release. We said that we felt 2014 was shaping up to be a better year than 2013. And I think this is just reinforcing that. 
And the big difference that we see is that in 2014 it appears in the U.S economy is attempting to grow at a faster pace than it has in the last few years. In 2014 for the first time in a number of years, you’re seeing Europe beginning to grow rather than shrink. You continue to see growth broadly across Asia, albeit at a slightly lower rate, still growing quite strongly. I think what we’re really seeing here is the result of an improving, broader economy and our efforts of trying to gain market share inside those spaces combined our results and the nice growth for TI. And as Ron said for the second half, we’ll give you that forecast, at least the first part of that forecast in about 90 days. 
Ron Slaymaker
Vivek, maybe the other thing that I would just add real quick is, you see our inventory numbers. We have good, healthy inventory. It’s not getting drawn down. And again customers were worried about supply from Texas Instruments, you would see probably some impact on those type metrics and yet we don’t right now. Do you have a follow on to that?
Vivek Arya - Banc of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Thanks for answering that first question. You guys are the largest player in this space. That’s really encouraging to see the kind of trends that you’re reporting. As my follow up question just probably more a math question, but at what revenue level would underutilization charges be behind you? Or asked in a different way, if you’re saying you have installed capacity of $18 billion and your current sales are about, I don’t know say $13 billion, will we continue to see underutilization charges until you use all of your installed capacity? Or how should we think about that underutilization charge number that you report every quarter in relation to the amount of installed capacity that you have and then obviously the implications on how we should model your gross margins going forward? 
Kevin March
Yeah. Vivek, I would suggest you think about it the way we do and the way most of our investors that we speak with seem to think about it, and that is not what is the underutilization capacity of the current period gross profit margin or next period gross profit margin, but what’s the total free cash flow that we can generate with that available capacity and what’s the cheapest way to bring that capacity in house so that we can maximize cash flow going forward? And that’s exactly how we think about it. So frankly we do no focus on trying to figure out how to get the utilization charge down to zero. In fact by definition, with our stated strategy of buying capacity opportunistically when we don’t need it, when prices are relatively low, that by definition means that we will always have open capacity and therefore we’ll always be underutilized in a classic sense. 
But from a cash flow standpoint, when we do the math and the trade off on that and the last few years are certainly proving that out, we generate a heck of a lot more cash flow with that kind of behavior than we would if we focused purely on maximizing utilization which puts us at the risk of buying capacity at two expensive of a price. So that’s the way we look at it. And I’d offer that you maybe think about it on the longer term view like that as opposed to trying to model in near term GPM percent swings and utilization swings. 
Ron Slaymaker 
Okay Vivek, thank you for your questions. Let’s move to the next caller.

We move to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford C. Bernstein 
Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I apologize if this has been covered. I hopped on a little late, but when I’m looking at your guidance for next quarter and I’m backing into sort of the implications for gross margin, I’m getting something that’s reasonably close to 57%. It’s almost 300 basis points increase. I think you’d mentioned higher revenue. I think you’d also talked about the six inch fab closures. My understanding was the fab closures that were already in the numbers. Is this something that happens like as a lump improvement this quarter or any color you can give us on I guess the relative impact of drivers revenue, cost saving and mix would be very helpful. And I guess just some indication of whether that 57% number is something that you guys are actually are thinking for next quarter? 
Kevin March
Yes. Stacy, on the margins clearly they are going to be up and they are going to be up quite a bit and it’s not dissimilar to what you saw a year ago. If you go to a year ago and take a look you would have seen our gross margins from 1Q to 2Q increased in a similar manner. And in part that’s just a natural effect of stepping up manufacturing production for a typically stronger second quarter versus one quarter. So if you take a look today on a year over year basis, the best way to think about it is that we continue to have improved product mix. A year ago we still had wireless. Now we have virtually none. So it’s mostly analog and embedded processing. 
We have lower manufacturing costs versus a year ago and again this is the Houston and Hiji factories now completely out of the mix. And to a lesser extent we have some lower utilization charges because in fact we are expecting revenue levels this quarter, this 2Q to be higher than they were 2Q a year ago. And so that will take on a little bit more of our capacity. So there’s a combination of things going on there. And the bottom line is that when you do the math, your gross margins are going to be stepping up rather nicely as you just suggested. 
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford C. Bernstein 
Got it. And I guess to follow up on that same trend. Presumably you’ll continue to have higher revenues year over year than you had last year. And you are sitting now, I would think it’s close to 600 basis points higher than you were last year. Does this mean that you could actually maybe even have visibility into the ballpark of 60% exiting the year and going into 2015? Is that something that you guys -- I don’t know if you guys think internally about gross margin targets anymore, but that’s something that – is this something that could actually be plausible at this point? 
Kevin March
Stacey I would say that a lot of numbers are plausible. We don’t really spend time thinking or looking at it in that context. We spend again more time thinking in context of are we taking steps that are going to maximize our free cash flow on a continuous basis. And in doing that then GPM just tends to fall out. So from that standpoint there’s nothing structural that stops us from getting higher GPMs as we move forward. In fact if we continue to be successful as we have been in increasing our analog and embedded processing mix, at the same time of keeping very low cost manufacturing underneath that mix, then clearly our margins not only are benefiting as you are computing now, but will continue to benefit as we look into the future. 
Ron Slaymaker
Okay Stacy, thanks for your questions and operator I think we have time for one final caller.

We’ll move to Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Eric Rasmus – Stifel Nicolaus 
Hi, it’s Eric [Rasmus] calling in for Tore. I appreciate you just getting me in here. I know a lot has been talked about the restructuring, but maybe just can you talk about the progress on the Embedded Processing business in boosting those operating margins there? I know last quarter looked like just some out performance and the margins were up. But is there a target that you’re shooting for internally? Is there something that you can maybe tell us for your end and maybe help us measure the progress there? 
Kevin March
Eric, I think the way to think about the Embedded Processing is that again we’ve been seeing some nice growth in that business. I think if I recall six quarters of year over year growth going on in that business. So we’re beginning to see the payoff of prior investments resulting in real revenue growth. That growth is in the right areas. It’s where we can -- we’ve got sustainable product revenue streams and very attractive margins. Consequently we’re seeing profit margins beginning to improve rather nicely and that’s even before we see the benefit of the restructuring actions that we talked about for Embedded Processing. 
That’s not to say that we’re done. There’s still quite a bit more work to be done, but most importantly with that business is focusing on is growing into its inherent cost base. And so more growth is what’s going to be really important there. And clearly at its current operating profit levels, it’s not anywhere near where we think it can take us to. I won’t go beyond that on forecasting what margins might be, but I think you know from how we operate the business here we’re focused on free cash flow, which means you’ve got to have some right margins in there. And this business still has quite a bit of work to do to get to where we expect entitlement is. 
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow on, Eric?
Eric Erasmus 
Okay, great. Thanks for that. Yeah, CapEx maybe. Where do you see your investments being focused? How do you plan on allocating your CapEx I guess over the next 12 months? Thank you. 
Kevin March
Eric, we did announce that with the 4Q earnings released that we had just acquired an assembly tests site in Chengdu, China. We’ll be spending money on that in 2014 bringing that building up to our standards and bringing the production line up and ready for output in the second half or late this year. So the majority of our CapEx will tend to go toward our assembly and test operations given that we already have significant capacity in our wafer fab operations.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, great. Eric, thanks for your questions and we’re going to wrap it at this point. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

This concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter and 2013 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and yearend earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
The fourth quarter was a good one and wraps up a good year. We are entering the first quarter of 2014 feeling better than we did entering the first quarter of 2013. Before I review the quarter, let me provide some information that is important to your calendars.
Starting this quarter, we will not be providing a mid-quarter update to our outlook. Our business is now sufficiently diverse across markets and customers that we believe a mid-quarter update is no longer necessary. The diversity in our business means that TI’s results should mostly reflect broader industry tech trends as opposed to TI’s specific considerations such as adjustments in demand from a large customer. In fact, in our last eight updates, we narrowed to the middle of the range six times on a revenue basis.
We do plan to hold a call on March 13 to update you on our capital management strategy. This will be a follow-on to the call we did a year ago on this topic. In this call, Kevin March will provide insight into our strategy and also answer some of the most frequent questions that we are asked about this strategy. More details will be forthcoming.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was in the upper half of our range of expectations. Once again cash generation and returns remained strong. Free cash flow was $3 billion or 24% of revenue for the trailing 12 months period, or in this case, the full year of 2013. Over that same period, we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. This return was 136% of free cash flow for the year. Again our strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to our shareholders except what is needed to repay debt.
EPS was at midpoint of our range. However it also included $0.03 of charges for a restructuring action that was not previously included in our guidance. So overall a good quarter.
The restructuring that is underway is a result of our ongoing assessment of our investments and the market opportunities that we are addressing with those investments. First, we are reducing costs in certain embedded processing product lines that either have matured or do not offer the return opportunities we are looking for. These changes will accelerate a profit margin improvement in the embedded business while still maintaining its pace of growth.
Of note that we are not exiting any markets or discontinuing any existing products but are aligning resources consistent with our updated views of the market opportunities.
We are also lowering costs in Japan by reducing resources in that country to levels that are appropriate to the opportunity. Combined, these actions are expected to result in annualized savings of about $130 million by the end of 2014. As a result of these actions, we will eliminate about 1100 jobs.
Total charges are estimated to be about $80 million where $49 million included in the fourth quarter results and the remaining charges of about $30 million to be included in the first quarter. These charges are recognized in the other segment.
In the fourth quarter results, TI revenue grew 2% from a year ago. Excluding legacy wireless, revenue grew 10% with double digit growth in both analog and embedded processing. Sequentially, revenue declined 7% with half of the declines due to seasonally lower calculated revenue.
Analog revenue grew 12% from a year ago and declined 3% sequentially. From a year ago, all four major product lines were up with power management leading the growth. Sequentially, all major product lines were down with high performance analog declining the most.
Embedded processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago and declined 10% sequentially. From a year ago, the growth was due to strengthened micro-controllers. Connectivity revenue grew a single-digit percentage rate and processors were about even. Sequentially, all areas were down with the biggest decline in processors.
In our other segment, revenue declined $209 million or 27% from a year ago. The decline was due to legacy wireless dropping $216 million. Sequentially, other revenue was down $90 million due to the seasonal decline in calculators. Legacy wireless revenue was $54 million in the fourth quarter and we expect it to be essentially gone in the first quarter.
Turning to distribution. Resales declined 3% sequentially, trending about the same as our semiconductor product revenue. Distributors’ inventory levels were about even with the prior quarter.
Let me make a couple of observations about the year overall. For 2013, analog and embedded processing revenue grew a combined 4% with analog up 3% and embedded up 9%. These two key areas were 79% of TI revenue for the year, up from 72% in 2012.
Operating margin for analog was 25.8% and it exceeded 30% during the second half. Operating margin for embedded processing was 7.6%, a level that should increase as we continue to grow and as we execute our restructuring plans to better align resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing.
Finally, we are refining descriptions of our end market mix to more closely match our perspective of our markets and investments. Traditionally, we and many other companies have described the markets as communications, computing, industrial, consumer, automotive and education. The real world didn’t always align so cleanly and some of the categorizations became blurred. For example, consumer smartphones were included with infrastructure equipment in the communications market and consumer tablets were included with servers in the computing market. In both of these examples, high volume consumer products were grouped together with enterprise equipment that have very different life cycles and market characteristics.
We believe our revised segmentation is more description and reflective of the markets we sell into and therefore more helpful for our understanding of our business. Starting now we will provide an annual snapshot of our product mix along the following market descriptions. Industrial which is 24% of revenue in 2013; automotive which was 13% of revenue; personal electronics which was 37% of revenue and include subsets which we call sectors such as notebooks, tablets, mobile phones and consumer products.
Communications equipment which was 16% of revenue; enterprise systems which include sectors such as servers and projectors was 6% of revenue; and calculators which was 4% of revenue. We have matched [ph] our product revenue in these markets as well as the sectors and even in the equipment levels below that, we find this especially beneficial for the industrial markets where the market definition has historically not been very clear and where we have a strong strategic focus.
We now have a reasonably precise profile of where our revenue is shifting that is more accurate than we’ve had in the past. We’ve included on our website this 2013 product revenue breakout by market along with the 2011 and 2012 historical breakouts. We’ve also identified the sectors below the markets provide you a clear understanding of how we are mapping the revenue. We will not be disclosing our revenue breakout below the market level. We plan to update this for you annually.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.64 billion, or 54.2% of revenue. Gross profit declined 8% sequentially – about the same as the 7% decline in revenue. Gross margin held up very well, slipping only 60 basis points from last quarter’s record high.
From a year ago, gross profit was up 13% – well above the 2% increase in revenue. The result was a 570 basis point expansion in gross margin. There are a couple of major reasons for gross profit expanding significantly faster than revenue.
First, the quality of our portfolio has improved as the higher proportion of our revenue is from Analog and Embedded Processing products. Second, our factory utilization has improved as we have increased loadings in our most advanced factories and we have shut down older, less-efficient manufacturing assets, such as our Houston and Hiji 6-inch factories.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $807 million was down $26 million sequentially and down $48 million from a year ago. The sequential decline is mostly due to seasonality, as employees typically take more vacation and holiday time in the fourth quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the wind down of our legacy wireless products.
Acquisition charges were $84 million, almost all of which is the on-going amortization of intangibles, a non-cash expense.
Restructuring and other charges were $62 million. This included a $49 million charge for the restructuring action that Ron discussed. This was not included in our prior guidance and negatively impacted earnings by $0.03 per share.
Operating profit was $687 million, or 22.7 % of revenue. Our tax rate in the quarter was 25%, a point above the 24% that we had guided. The effective tax rate remained 24% but we had several small discrete items that pulled the rate up in the quarter.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $511 million, or $0.46 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.20 billion in the quarter. We increased our inventory by $5 million compared with the prior quarter. Inventory days increased by 6 days to 112 days, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days.
Capital expenditures were $107 million in the quarter. I should note this includes our purchase of a 358,000 square foot assembly and test facility in Chengdu, China, that is adjacent to our existing wafer fab. We expect to have this facility equipped and in production by the fourth quarter of this year.
On a trailing 12 months basis, Cash flow from operations was $3.38 billion. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $412 million, or 3% of revenue. As a result, free cash flow was $2.97 billion, or 24% of revenue. This is within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue.
I’ll note that depreciation expense for the full year was $879 million. Depreciation exceeded our capital expenditures by $467 million, or 3.8% of revenue. Over the next few years, as we continue to hold capital spending to low levels, depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending and our gross margin will directly benefit.
And as we’ve said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, TI paid $326 million in dividends and repurchased $734 million of our stock for a total return of $1.06 billion.
Our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders, except for what we need to repay debt. In the full year 2013, free cash flow was $2.97 billion and we reduced our debt level by $500 million. We returned a total of $4.04 billion to shareholders, or 136% of free cash flow. This return was 54% higher than in 2012. We returned more than our full free cash flow in the year because proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, totaling $1.31 billion in the year, have also been an additional source of cash for the company, all of which was used to repurchase stock.
There was an abnormally high level of exercises in the year due to the stock price performance. Although the exercises were somewhat of a headwind for the share count reduction, we more than offset this with stock repurchases. In the end, we reduced our shares outstanding by 25 million shares, or 2.3%, in 2013 similar to the last couple years. In total, we have reduced our share count by 37% since the beginning of 2005 with our repurchases.
Fundamental to our cash return strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the fourth quarter with $3.83 billion of cash and short-term investments with 82% of that amount owned by TI’s U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely on-shore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI’s orders declined 10% sequentially and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.94.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would decline 3% sequentially with most of the decline coming from the final step-down in legacy wireless revenue, which is now essentially gone and should not be a factor in the sequential trends after the first quarter. Therefore, if you exclude the legacy wireless revenue from the fourth quarter of 2013, revenue at the middle of this range would be almost even sequentially. If you exclude it from the first quarter of 2013, growth would be 10%
.
We expect first-quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.44, which includes a $0.02 EPS impact from the $30 million of restructuring charges discussed earlier. We expect our effective tax rate in 2014 to increase to 27% and this is the rate you should use in your models for the first quarter. This is about 3 percentage points higher than our 2013 effective tax rate, negatively impacting EPS by $0.02 in the first quarter. This rate is higher due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2013 and our forecast for higher profits in the year. Historically, the R&D tax credit has expired and was later reinstated retroactively to its expiration date.
In summary, we’re encouraged that a lot of hard work at TI over the past few years is producing results. Today, we’re a company firmly rooted in Analog and Embedded Processing – areas that have strong potential for growth and good profits that require low capital investments and, therefore, can generate a lot of cash.
Although much of the heavy lifting associated with the structural improvement at TI is now behind us, our work is not done. The restructuring action we discussed today is a result of an on-going process at TI of review and continuous improvement. This process helps ensure we focus our investments on opportunities that have the best potential for sustainable growth and returns.
With that, I’ll turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?

2014-01-21,Q&A," Session

(Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities
I guess, Ron, could you help me understand when you talk about these realignment actions, how big of a revenue pie did these costs kind of cover, and what was sort of the growth hurdle or the gross margin hurdle that you guys used to try to determine this sort of realignment of costs?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I don't know that I can get into all of that detail, John. But clearly the embedded processing overall runs – I think last year was just about 20% of our revenue. The processor piece of that, I think we've probably communicated -- I can update it even for 2013 – was 50% of our revenue last year. And again, that's where, I would say, most of the actions in embedded processing are taking place. And again, it's primarily in processors. I would say secondarily, we're taking some action inside of microcontrollers as well. But processors was about half the revenue. And, of course, not all of processors has been affected, but certain product lines within that.
And then separately the action in Japan, last year Japan was about 9% of our total revenue. And again this is just more or less an action to. On one hand, we'll be consolidating some of the business activity that was previously in Japan just to other regions of the world where we can do it more efficiently. But then also we'll be effecting some of the sales and marketing activities in Japan, kind of to align those resources with that opportunity that we see in Japan going forward. So, do you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse Securities
Yes, just relative to the new segmentation with personal electronics being 37%. I'm just kind of curious, should that be an area where we see future realignment or do you feel given your cost structure, you can still go after the growth in that market? Is that sort of acceptable returns? How do I think about that 37% over time as a percent of the mix?
Kevin March
John, I would say that – if you take a look at that on the website, you'll see that it’s down a little bit year-over-year, and really what's going on there is the wind down of the legacy wireless. That's really the handset and the tablet space is coming down. We'll continue to be engaged in personal electronics, make no mistake about it. The biggest difference is that we'll be driving a lot more aggressively with our catalog products as opposed to custom products. And on the historical basis, the catalog products tend to have a much longer life to them and a much better margin profile to them than custom products do.
So there won't be any overt change to our approach to personal electronics. It will just wind down on its own because of the wind down in legacy wireless, that was the biggest driver of that.
Operator
And we will go next to Doug Freedman of RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets
Can you take a look or give us some insight into how far all of your acquisitions have been integrated? What you're talking about now on your restructuring front, it sounds like really end market related. Are there more efficiencies to be gained through further synergies that you might identify?
Kevin March
Doug, we haven't made an acquisition in a couple of years of any meaningful size and we've pretty much wound up the, if you will, the synergistic opportunities of that consolidation about a year ago now. So, there's not really much in the way of synergy as it relates to acquisitions going forward. What we're doing on this restructuring is just part of an ongoing exercise that we've actually done for a long time. They're usually of a smaller level, in this case, a little bit larger. But that's really looking at where we're spending our research dollars and looking at the market opportunity that those products from that research spend would go into.
In this case, we've got some of the markets have matured or about to mature, which means, we don't need to have as many teams designing new parts for it or in other cases, we may have invested in certain markets where we had anticipated better growth and return opportunities. But those initial expectations have since been changed for a variety of reasons. So, there's really no acquisition synergies that I can think of to suggest to you. This is just really an ongoing process of dealing with the reality of market changes over time.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have follow-on, Doug?
Doug Freedman – RBC Capital Markets
Yes. My follow-up. There has been some concern in the industry as far as unit growth and the ability to grow revenue sort of above global GDP levels. We saw some interesting data out of the SIA recently showing some pretty steep declines in analog ASPs. Can you comment if you're seeing any change in the way either you or your competitors are approaching the business?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't know about competitors. But I can say that at TI, we have not reset our exceptions downward as you might be suggesting there from a growth standpoint. I think over the last few years global GDP has been certainly below normalized run rate and that certainly has affected our industry as well. But our view is that the markets that we serve being analog and embedded processing will likely grow on a unit basis. And frankly, from a revenue basis about 2x global GDP, we believe that for some time. Again, we're looking at longer term trends, not what happened over the last three years or even five years. Again, our view on that is unchanged.
Operator
We will go next to Christopher Danely of JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan Securities
Just a question on the restructuring, how much of the cost savings will go into COGS versus OpEx and what do you think is going to be the revenue headwind by the end of the year in terms of taking these products out?
Kevin March
Chris, on the costs savings, again, we anticipate by the end of the year we'll be at about $130 million annualized cost savings as we exit the year. About 65% of that will probably be an R&D, about 20% in SG&A and about 15% in cost of revenue.
As it relates to revenue there should be no impact on revenue. We're not eliminating products, we're not discontinuing products. These are products that have very long lives. What we're really dealing with here is that the rate of change in those markets have matured now in most cases and it no longer makes sense to continue to invest or invest as heavily as we have because there's just not growth window there.
Ron Slaymaker
And Chris, many of these markets that we view are maturing, frankly, you could double, you could triple the investment and not affect the revenue level, not affect the growth rate just because the nature of what the market trend overall is doing. So again, let me just reiterate. We said in the prepared remarks, but – Kevin just said it, there are no products being discontinued and we're not exiting any markets with this action. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Danely – JPMorgan Securities
Yes. Can you guys just maybe give us kind of the status update on your end markets and what you expect to grow maybe the most personally [ph] the least for this year?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, I can do a part of that, which is the historical view. I don't think we want to try to extrapolate into a forecast for 2014. But let me just start with fourth quarter '13, and again, this information really is coming out of the database that I just grabbed we've put together for our new market framing. But again, fourth quarter, most end markets were down sequentially. The biggest driver of our revenue decline though was a seasonal decline in calculators. I think as we said before, that was half of the sequential dollar decline in the fourth quarter.
Outside of that, personal electronics declined the most, followed by enterprise systems and industrial; and all three of those areas declined at single-digit percentage rate. Automotive and communications equipment were each about even sequentially. Just a little more color on some of those areas. Industrial, we saw strength in appliances and industrial displays, but that strength was offset – more than offset actually by broad-based declines elsewhere. In enterprise systems, really we saw weakness or declines there due to servers.
And in personal electronics, we saw declines in TVs, gaming, and printers, and we saw strength sequentially in tablets. Moving to the full year 2013, industrial for TI, this is based for our revenue was up 7% that was driven by factory automation, building automation, appliances, medical and motor drive. Automotive was up 14% for TI in the year, driven by infotainment systems, as well as advanced driver assist systems and safety. Personal electronics revenue was down 18%, due to mobile phones and tablets as we wound down our legacy wireless business, followed by much smaller declines in other areas of personal electronics.
Communications infrastructure for the year was up 4%, driven by both wireless infrastructure and enterprise switching. Enterprise systems for the year was down 8%, driven by servers and projectors, and then calculators declined 3% for the year.
Operator
And we will go next to Blayne Curtis of Barclays.
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital
I apologize if you answered this already. The decline in embedded, you had expected decline in processors. Is that greater than you were expecting and what is your trajectory this year for that business?
Ron Slaymaker
Blayne, let me first of all get some data in front of me. We saw and it's – are you talking about the sequential trend in fourth quarter there?
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital
Sequential decline into the December quarter, it was down double-digits.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes. And so I don't – to be honest, I don't have the data here on our forecast. I can't say that was – I again reiterate it was down double-digits as was connectivity. Microcontrollers was down also but to a much lesser degree, but I don't have the forecast data on processors to be able to say what it did versus our expectations. Do you have a follow-on, Blayne?
Blayne Curtis – Barclays Capital
Yes. I think someone asked this already. But just looking at the March quarter sequentially, do you see any of your segments growing? And if so, which ones and would you point out any segments that are outside of calculators that are down a significant amount?
Ron Slaymaker
Again, calculators will be typically flattish in the fourth to first transition. That's their typical seasonal pattern anyway. The only area that we really said we expect an additional decline is in legacy wireless where it will go from $54 million in the fourth quarter to be essentially gone in the first quarter. I think we described that already. Outside of those two areas, we don't really have comments in terms of end market trends that we expect to evidence in first quarter.
Operator
And we will go next to Stephen Chin of UBS.
Stephen Chin – UBS Securities
First question is on your automotive segment. Based off of the strong 14% growth that you just mentioned for last year, I was wondering if you’d any color from downstream customers on inventory levels and supply chain and especially given the, I think comments from AutoNation last week about relatively high automotive inventories in the U.S., any comments on momentum there in the first half of the year?
Ron Slaymaker
Steve, I don’t – I probably don't have anything more that we would have from a – that would be a unique perspective that TI provides. When you have somebody talk like AutoNation talking about inventory of automobiles, you have that data, we don't have any unique perspective. That's several layers below where we're selling into that, that supply chain. I'll speak more broadly that we believe inventory seems to be pretty well managed currently, if not lean. You heard my comments on distribution. Distribution inventories remain below 5.5 weeks, which again are lean. But anything in terms of a particular supply chain like automotive, we really don't have that granularity. But again, our general sense is inventory is not at all an issue more broadly into the markets that we're serving. Do you have a follow-on, Stephen?
Stephen Chin – UBS Securities
Yes. My follow-up is on gross margins and sort of relative to where your inventory levels are currently. If I'm not mistaken, in prior quarters you were able to build a little bit of strategic inventories, some of your longer shelf life products? And just given where the inventory levels are currently, would it be safe to say that you would not continue to build any more strategic inventory?
Kevin March
Stephen, on the inventory, we just closed the quarter at about 112 days of inventory, which is consistent with the model that we have for ourselves of carrying between 105 days and 115 days. And specifically, if you look at our balance sheet, you'll notice that during the fourth quarter, we drained our work-in-process and our finished goods increased somewhat. That's just reloading the factories to meet the lowered outlook that we had in the fourth quarter.
We do expect in the first quarter to begin to reload the factories as we go forward. Inside that 112 days is the strategic inventory that you were talking about, which is our products that have long shelf lives, and we've been building that up for a couple of years now. And we'll continue to manage that at about these current levels.
Operator
And we will go next to Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Co.
Timothy Arcuri – Cowen & Co.
Ron, can you talk – given the savings on the OpEx, can you talk a little bit about how OpEx is going to work its way through the year? Is there sort of anything out of the ordinary other than just how the $130 million gets – ratably impacts the P&L through the year?
Kevin March
Tim, let me go ahead and comment on that for Ron. The first thing to remember about OpEx is that it'll seasonally go up in first quarter. If you look over the last three or four years and just compute an average, you can see that on average we've probably got about 4% fourth quarter to first quarter. And you can expect an increase again in this first quarter as we start out 2014.
As we flow through the year, the cost savings that we talked about as a result of the restructuring actions will begin to show up in the second half of the year, and by the time we leave the year, we'll have – we'll be at about $130 million annualized savings rate at that breakout that I mentioned earlier across R&D, SG&A and cost of revenue.
Ron Slaymaker
Tim, do you have a follow-on?
Timothy Arcuri – Cowen & Co.
I do, yes. So, if I look at analog's share, you've been talking about SVA gaining share this year. And if you just take seasonal December for the SIA, it looks like your share in analog basically was flat in '13 versus '12. So, is there something that maybe might start to kick-in in 2014 that is going to cause analog to gain share year-over-year?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, we'll see how our 2014 rolls out. I guess for starters based on the WSTS data that's been released through November, we believe we actually gained a small amount of share in analog. And by the way, I should note if we just look over the last few years, I guess I have data since 2009 in front of me. On average, we've gained analog share at probably 30 basis points to 40 basis points on average per year. We've gained in every one of those years.
And the range has been pretty broad, I mean there were some years where we may be, I'll say, 10 basis points of gain and other years during that time period where we've gained over 100 basis points. So, I would say it's not necessarily a smooth curve in terms of market share gains, but at least it's consistent from the standpoint of what we believe we've gained share every year. And it's our expectation and our intention to continue doing that, including 2014.
By the way everything I think I just said there, I could also apply to embedded processing. Although I would also say that embedded processing probably in 2013, our share stepped up a little more strongly in embedded processing than it did in analog last year. But again, market share is important to us. Everything I've also described about our market share gains was on an organic basis, so it's not comprehending acquisitions and the impact of National anything like that, but again we've been gaining share consistently and we expect to continue that. I guess, that was your follow on, Tim.
Operator
And we will go to Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs
Recognizing it's a relatively small part of the business, are you managing the 8% year-over-year declines in servers as if that's a secular issue driven by server virtualization that some of the other companies have also highlighted, uniqueness in that area? Or do you think that was more of a cyclical issue in the sever market? Do you expect to bounce back in that area?
Kevin March
Well Jim, I'll comment on that. I can't specifically that we're managing servers by itself. We are looking at the entire compute space, notably hard disk drives for example. And noting what's been going on in total demand for hard disk drives and managing accordingly to what looks to be a secular decline as you pointed out Jim in that space. And so we've been adjusting our investment levels in that technology development and our staffing levels and so on to meet what we believe as a smaller market going forward than what we've seen in recent years.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs
In terms of the M&A outlook, I know, you'd just mentioned that you haven't done a deal in a couple of years and obviously, you guys have been so good about doing these deals over the years and then you have integrated and potentially over time, you've looked at others. If you do not do a deal in the next couple of years, do you think it would be because you really don't find one that's for sale that makes sense or do you just really not think that incremental deals make sense regardless of whether they're available from here?
Kevin March
Jim, I'd say it's more the first, not the latter. That is, when we take a look at potential acquisitions, we look real hard at the numbers and we've got to be able to make sense of the numbers. Namely, we’ve got to be able to get a return on that investment that exceeds our weighted average cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe, which we define as three years to four years. So, if we can't get past the numbers, then we just simply step aside and wait for an opportunity to come at a later date. So, really a numbers driven analysis as we look at M&A.
Operator
And we will go next to Ambrish Srivastava of Bank of Montreal.
Ambrish Srivastava – BMO Capital Markets-US
A question on the divergence and I know that every quarter both the businesses will not track around the same levels. But embedded was down a lot more on a Q-over-Q basis versus analog. What was driving that?
Ron Slaymaker
Ambrish, I think it's very similar to what you said. I don't know that it's just the markets that embedded sells into. In this case we noted that the processor area was down more than other areas. Obviously, you're going to have different customers, you're going to have different markets, but they're both very diverse businesses, but they're not uniformly consistent in terms of the customers, the markets that they're selling into. Beyond that, we don't have a specific color for you yet.
Ambrish Srivastava – BMO Capital Markets-US
Going back to the comments you made earlier on, at the top of the call, you mentioned that you're feeling a little more and I don't want to paraphrase the word, but the message was you're feeling better about 2014 than you did heading into 2013. Is that just to do with the new rationalized product portfolio or is that a comment based on what you're seeing from the end markets?
Ron Slaymaker
I think it's both to be honest. I'll make some comments, then Kevin probably has some things as to how he's feeling as well. But I'd say first of all, the strength and position of where we are today in analog and embedded is a big factor. Having those two product lines now making up 82% of our revenue going out of the year in the fourth quarter, frankly, is a great feeling and positions us – you know as well as any Ambrish, how long the wind-down of that wireless revenue was.
Having that wind-down behind us, such that the top line growth of the company can reflect lot of the good things that we're doing, a lot of the potential that analog and embedded have embedded in them is just great. I think also more specifically, the overall environment in terms of the markets that we're selling those products into, and frankly, just areas of strategic focus, such as we've said, industrial is really important to us. Automotive is really important to us. The strength of those markets and frankly our position in those markets, not that our position is so strong that it saturated, we like the fact that we have lots of headroom for growth and market share gains. But we also like the design position we have there.
And then maybe just a little more tactically, coming out of fourth quarter, our book-to-bill was strong, exiting the year than it was a year ago, and we also have good backlog coverage coming into the first quarter as well. So, those are the kinds of things that I know we look at. Kevin, do you have anything else you would add?
Kevin March
Yes, Ambrish, I'd probably just say, on a macro level, looking at the total economy, the U.S. economy clearly seems to be stepping up its growth, Europe appears to have stopped declining, and it appears that China has stabilized, and those are three big economic regions of the world. So you’ve got to feel better about that at this stage, starting 2014 than we did 12 months ago starting 2013, with the uncertainty we're all staring at in those three economies.
And then again, a bit more tactically to what Ron was talking. If you look back a year ago, the sum of analog and embedded processing was 74% of TI, today it's 82%. A year ago, analog and embedded processing were down quarter-over-quarter, 9% on revenue in fourth quarter and flat year-over-year. Fast forward to this year and not only is analog and embedded processing bigger in percent and it's also bigger in dollar terms, it was only down 5% quarter-over-quarter and is up 12% year-over-year. So, we've got real momentum going, as we move into 2014. So, you take the macro look, you take a TI specific as the portfolio is finishing its restructuring, and you got to feel pretty good about how we're going to start 2014 and what the year might hope for us.
Operator
We will take our next question from Tore Svanberg of Stifel Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Nicolaus
First, I had a capital management question. So, last year was pretty unusual $4 billion, and $1.3 billion I think you said came from stock option exercises. I know obviously you don't have a crystal ball on this. But could you just give us a rough sense as we look into 2014, what we can expect as far as free cash flow generation? And especially, maybe handicapping, the year's stock option exercises?
Kevin March
Tore, I do wish I had a crystal ball to help out with that particular question, but like you, I'm lacking on that right now. I would say that we would expect that the exercises are going to be lower next year than they were this past year. But I would also just put aside any concern about that because frankly, we just use the cash proceeds from those exercises to buy back shares. So it doesn't really impact what we've been able to do to share count for our stockholders.
I believe in early March, we're going to have -- as Ron mentioned, we're going to have a capital management strategy update and that will be a really good time to ask some of these questions. I'll take you a little deeper into some of what we're thinking on, on where we're going with capital management at that time.
Tore Svanberg – Stifel Nicolaus
Also do you have any CapEx and R&D estimates for the year? I know in the past, sometimes you've at least given the R&D guidance for the year. Just wondering if you can do that again this year.
Kevin March
Yes, but I'd say, going forward, you're not going to be getting that from us anymore, Tore. The CapEx guidance that we’ll give you simply is a band that we talk about around our revenue, meaning that our target is 4% to 7% of revenue, on any one year. And we expect that – given the size of our manufacturing footprint today, we don't expect to be pushing above the lower end of the range. In other words, probably more around 4% of that range of revenue, until we hit about $18 billion of revenue.
So, from a CapEx guidance, that's how I'd suggest you -- you'll hear the modeling from us going forward, and not a specific number. And on R&D, frankly we're reaching a point now where it's pretty stable and it should probably just kind of grow with paying [ph] benefit increases over time and with the top line revenue growth over time. So, based upon that, we're not going to be providing R&D guidance going forward. You'll be able to just take a look at our results and it'll be pretty straightforward for you to model that going forward.
Ron Slaymaker
And I think, Tore, the other one I would comment on is, we've also historically given annual guidance for depreciation. But again given that depreciation is so gapped these days from CapEx and frankly, it's a multi-year lagging indicator versus our CapEx trend. So, it just doesn't seem to us to be an especially useful number and from a guidance standpoint and clearly you guys can go up and make some assumptions of what that may be just given what our capital spending trends have been.
Operator
We will take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America.
Vivek Arya – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Actually both my questions are about different end markets. So first on the wireless infrastructure market, if you could give us a sense for whether some of the restructuring you're doing on the processor side. Does that impact the ability to benefit from all these 4G LTE deployments, or am I just feeding too much into that, then there isn't; any connection in that case, what are the trends that you are seeing in that market?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Vivek, I would say that, first of all, we don't believe anything that we are doing here is going to impact our ability to benefit from LTE deployments. And again, a lot of those – and that does not mean that the base station area is not an area where we're seeing some resource reductions, it is. But just in general, LTE we are already very well positioned across those various customers, our system-on-a-chip products have been out in the market for some time. And so we just have a great position as LTE continues to deploy.
As to the comment -- let me just talk maybe more broadly and I'll start at the embedded processing level and then drill down into some of your comps infrastructure question. But let me say, again, just you heard us give the numbers, but embedded processing has really delivered strong growth this year. That came out of areas like catalog, microcontrollers, specifically product lines like the MSP430, the C2000. It came out of areas like connectivity, processors for automotive markets, processors for industrial markets. So, those areas that have been driving and producing growth, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we have in the past. The reductions that we're making are, as I said before, primarily processors, and then secondarily, in some of the product areas in MCU. So, within processors, I would identify areas like IP cameras and certain areas of communications infrastructure, or frankly, the future growth just doesn't merit our current levels of investment.
Now, to specifically – kind of your question about LTE and base stations more broadly, I guess I don't want to go into a lot of specifics there, except to say again, comms infrastructure is an area that will receive fewer resources. And it's based on our view that parts of the macro base station market are maturing. On the flip side, small cell is an emerging opportunity for us and we'll continue to invest accordingly there. But even in the maturing areas of base station, as I started off here, we believe our revenue will continue for a very long time given the breadth of our position and the long lives of the equipment that we're already engaged with there. So, hopefully that provides you some color as to what we're doing in comms infrastructure. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes, Ron, actually I had thought about asking you about the PC market. But instead what I'll ask you is, in the market it's always about what have you done for me lately. And last year the TI story was about the benefits you got from exiting wireless, the really strong capital returns. And now I think for this year, what we're hearing is a sort of the same. So what is really the next catalyst that can help you either outflow the market or provide much superior returns than what we are seeing from the peer group? So, really, what is the value proposition for outsize invest for overweighting TI this year?
Kevin March
Well, Vivek, I think that there is a number of opportunities in front of us that we've got going on here. You've seen some pretty strong growth rates that we just talked about in the areas we've been focusing our attention on for a number of years now: analog and embedded processing. We talk about the fact that we're returning 100% of our free cash flow, that’s what we use for debt. But we also have a plenty of room to grow with very little need to spend that much more to grow and I'm talking specifically about our manufacturing footprint.
If you take a look at the very cost-effective factories that we've put into play over the last couple of years and the low-level of CapEx that takes for us now to keep those factories going, the incremental margin and cash flow opportunity from those factories is extremely attractive. In addition to that, we've just got the overall growing space in industrial and automotive which tend to be not only quite long-lived revenue profiles, but also quite attractive margin profiles. Again, those products run across those inexpensive factories and just help generate ample amounts of cash. So, I think from an investor standpoint, there are quite a few things to continue to look forward to, which is really our ability to continue to grow at the kind of rates that we're doing now inside the analog and embedded processing and leveraging the very inexpensive factories we put in place to generate a lot of cash.
Ron Slaymaker
So, Vivek, let me make a couple of other comments. I think a lot of our long-term oriented investors clearly looked through the wireless transition, frankly, even over the last few years into what TI was becoming, and that was the value proposition for them; a company focused on very diverse markets of analog and embedded processing that didn't require a lot of capital, that generated a lot of cash and then, as you pointed out, they liked management's commitments to return that cash to them.
I would kind of take a different view from what you described with some of the other investors because investors – a lot of investors I've talked to last year, the year before, the year before, the response was, give me a -- we like what you're doing in wireless, give me a call when you're out of it and that no longer represents a headwind for your growth. So, for investors that have been sitting on the sideline, because of the concern that wireless represented such a significant headwind to growth, I think the value proposition for them is clear. It's no longer there and the growth that we've been producing in analog and embedded is no longer going to be an obstacle for top line growth and for a lot of those investors, that frankly our growth hasn't screened very well in the past, that's not going to be an issue going forward. So, just my two cents' worth on that topic.
Operator
And we will go next to Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
Two quick ones. What would you say your new targets are if they've changed at all, for the growth rate in embedded as well as your operating margin goal in embedded given the restructuring actions?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I would just say first of all, in terms of growth rate target, absolutely no change. Again, I think embedded did a good job on growth last year. Frankly, we would have liked to have seen that growth come through at a higher level of profitability overall for the business but growth has not been an issue. And to the extent that we've tried to describe for you, our investments in the areas that are growing in embedded will continue unabated. So, our expectations for a growth in embedded are absolutely unchanged. And I think you'll continue to see good results there.
In terms of profitability and margin objective, I guess what I would say, Ross, is I know we've provided some numbers in the past. But in fact, I'll say what we've said in the past because I'm sure you have them in your notes there. I think in September 2012 investor meeting, our manager there described that his growth margin targets were 55% to 60%; operating margin target was about 30%. What I would say is, in general, a well-run company focused on the embedded processing market opportunity, we think has potential for a financial profile consistent with those types of numbers.
That being said, I don't think – what we're going to do with this segment is very similar to what we've done for analog and not the communicating specific gross margin and operating margin targets and progress going forward. But again, clearly, our objectives are much higher than where that business ran last year and ran fourth quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
I do. I can't let Kevin get away with the whole conference call without somebody asking about the gross margin. Kevin, any help on the puts and takes for the first quarter as we look at the gross margin? It seems to imply at the midpoints of everything that it's down a little bit, but just want to double check on that.
Kevin March
Ross, you're right, I won't give you specific guidance. But I'll give you some high level things to think about. Clearly as we came through the fourth quarter, we were taking our factory starts down through the quarter. As we go in the first quarter, we're taking our factory starts up, and that’s on the expectation of a normally stronger second quarter for us. The result of that is going to be that while starts will be higher in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter, the average utilization won't really change that much. So just based upon that and the timing of moving the wafers through the factories and through the assembly test sites, we would probably see a little bit of gross margin headwind as we bring those factories back up, but not a large amount.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. With that, my clock shows that it is 5.30. So we are going to wrap up at this point. I'd like to thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website and good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter 2013 Mid-Quarter Update Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the fourth quarter of 2013. Dave Pahl from our Investor Relations team is also joining me today. In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company.
In general, we will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segments or end markets, and we will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information.
As usual with our mid-quarter updates, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings around the middle of our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $2.92 billion and the $3.04 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.44 and $0.48.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?

2013-12-09,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] At this time, we'll take the first question, which will be from Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Ron, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see sort of channel inventories now, how comfortable you are at where the levels are.
Ron Slaymaker
Dave, why don't you talk a little bit about what we're seeing in DSP in general?
Dave Pahl
Yes. So -- hey, Glen. We expect resales from our distributors to decline about the same amount as our semiconductor revenues overall, and we don't expect that will result in much change in inventory days of distributors.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes, I'm wondering, Ron, if you have any color you can provide from on end market perspective. We are seeing some -- a little bit stronger PC, a little less strong handset. I don't know if that's something you can see in your business.
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I guess, what I would say is, at least from our perspective, we don't -- there's not really a lot of talk about by end market. The biggest consideration, of course, would be for calculators, where we have a significant seasonal decline this quarter following the third quarter back-to-school season. And in fact, calculators will make up, just as a reminder, about 1/2 of the sequential 8 percentage point decline for TI overall that we're expecting at the middle of that range. Given our current level of diversity, though, by customers, by end markets, our performance this quarter and probably going forward will be less impacted by any 1 customer or individual end market and more by the overall trends that we experience in the economy and electronics market, as well as by our own execution and performance, of course. So I guess, this quarter, considering the number of semiconductor companies that have issued guidance for sequential declines this quarter, I really don't think that we're seeing anything unique overall or by end market.
Operator
At this time, we'll take a question from Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Can you just talk a little bit about your linearity of bookings and how book-to-bill is trending so far?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So I don't have a specific comment on linearity, Chris, but I what I would say is that orders and backlog both have declined as we would typically expect for a fourth quarter. So that's a general observation, but I don't have the month-by-month report for you. Do have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes. Can you just remind us what would be a typical Q1 in terms of sequential growth or decline?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, as to our specific expectation, Chris, we'll wait until we report in January to share our first quarter outlook regarding what would be typical or seasonal. I'm going to let you determine what you believe to be seasonal based on your own analysis of our historical data. I guess, just some general comments, we would agree that our calculator revenue has a strong seasonal pattern through the course of the year, really associated with back-to-school, but we'd also agree that our semiconductor revenue growth is typically relatively stronger in the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth. Frankly, though, outside of that, we at TI don't put much credence into specific semiconductor sequential growth averages as being reflective of any kind of predictable seasonal pattern, really, because the range around those averages is so high, and that's something we've talked about for a long time now. But to avoid the appearance that I'm endorsing any particular number, I'll leave the calculations and assessment to you there, Chris.
Operator
And the next question will be from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Ron, first, just conceptually, without giving guidance, how are you thinking about the New Year? And if there's a bit of contrast back [ph] with how you've thought about the trends when 2013 started? Is there anything -- I understand the mobile businesses is obviously very different. But other than that, is -- are there any puts and takes that we should keep in mind as we start modeling next year?
Ron Slaymaker
All right. Vivek, I would just say, not specifically, again, I'll reiterate what I said before. We are -- our largest customer is now mid-single digits as a percent of our revenue. We are diverse across end markets. I don't know that we're sitting here viewing any specific end market or particular customer puts and takes as being particularly noteworthy as we come into the year. I think, in general, as we look at upcoming years, we would describe that we're probably in a somewhat modest environment, but that's not intended to be a positive or a negative statement. Just in general, we think we have been and will continue to be in a modest type of environment going forward. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. Sort of 2-part around cash. You have a $1 billion debt payment coming up in May. I was wondering how you'd think about that in relation to buyback activity. And just the bigger question is how long can you maintain cash returns above your free cash flow generation?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I guess, obviously, we don't run a perpetual cash flow engine. So we can't run over 100% forever, although what we've said last year -- or actually in the last quarter, where over the last trailing 12-month period, we had returned 133% of free cash flow. The reason we were able to sustain that level above free cash flow even with paying off $500 million of debt over that period was because we have seen an unusual amount of employee stock option exercises, given the strength in the stock price over the past year. So with those stock option exercises, basically, the grant price that the employees pay on the exercise of that stock is an additional source of free cash flow -- or additional source of cash, rather, for the company that we would probably describe as somewhat unusual over the last year or so. But that's the consideration and depending specifically on what exercises do going forward will depend -- will drive -- or determine, rather, what that source of cash is going forward. Your -- the rest of your question was about...
Dave Pahl
The debt...
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Do you want to respond, Dave?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think that in general, as we outlined in our capital management strategy that debt would remain a permanent part of our balance sheet as long as the interest rates made sense that they would be. So I think we'll wait till May to make that determination.
Ron Slaymaker
And, Vivek, let me also just kind of reiterate what we have said, our expectation is for shareholder returns, and that is basically all of free cash flow minus what is required for debt repayment we expect to return to our shareholders. So that's our commitment going forward.
Operator
We'll take a question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I know you said you don't really have the exposure to end markets. But given that you guided to the midpoint of your former ranges, Ron, is there any outliers either by end markets, product types, geographies, any sort of color you can give? Admittedly, again, you're at the average, we know that.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So, Ross, as we noted, I guess, I would just say that the quarter really is generally tracking consistently with our expectations, and that holds both at the company level as within -- as well as within various major product lines and end markets. And there is always some variation from those initial expectations, but I would just say there really is nothing that we would consider noteworthy. So again, the quarter really is tracking even by major product line consistent with those expectations that we communicated previously. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes. Kind of a bigger picture one for your Analog business. I believe, last year, that -- in the SIA date of the Analog business, the pricing was down about 5% year-over-year. And I think this year, the rolling 4 quarters, it's down about 13%. People tend to think of Analog in the place that's the least price-sensitive. As you guys are the biggest player in the Analog space, have you noticed any change in the competitive dynamic that would explain the ASPs heading the direction they are?
Ron Slaymaker
Dave, you want to take that one?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I will. Ross, in general, we don't believe that analog pricing has seen really any unusual decline. And first and foremost I'd just point to, if you look at gross margins both in our business as well as across the analog competitors, they're very healthy, and it would seem to reflect a very stable pricing environment. If anything, lower ASPs in the database could possibly reflect a mix change from different types of products. And just as an example, if you look at Integrated Products will often have the higher ASPs than less integrated catalog products that are often used in lower volume and in lower volume applications. So if a market like industrial that uses predominately those catalog devices is relatively stronger than the other markets, it could blend [ph] down the overall ASPs. Of course, just as a reminder, for those that might not know that those lower ASPs in catalog products don't translate to lower gross profits. And in fact, those are often some of our highest gross profit products.
Operator
James Covello with Goldman Sachs has the next question.
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I wanted to ask on the microcontroller business. I was hoping you could give us an update on the competitive environment and maybe which verticals or product groups you think you're best positioned in for share gains in 2014.
Ron Slaymaker
Dave, you want to take that?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I think if you look at our revenues inside of Embedded Processing, you've heard us talk about the investments that we've made in microcontrollers. And that one of the attractiveness that we like about microcontrollers is they really are used across all end markets and especially in -- inside of industrial. So some of the recent growth that we're seeing is a result of the investments that we made. And just as a reminder, we made those investments first in R&D, just expanding the number of design teams that we had producing microcontrollers and then followed that up with increases in investments at -- within our field sales force to have application engineers with specific expertise to support microcontrollers. So I would describe today our investment level is at and has been at a level that we think is necessary to drive that business, and we're continuing to expect to see growth in the future to support that level of investment.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-up, Gabriela?
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I do. On your connectivity products into the embedded market, how has that business trended post- the wireless restructuring last year? And what are the biggest applications for growth in 2014?
Dave Pahl
Gabriela, I don't have anything specific to say about this quarter. But in general, that business has done very well this year. As things want to get connected to the Internet and get smarter, that intelligence and that connectivity is playing really to the heart of what we're doing with those products. We currently support over a dozen different wireless technologies. And if you go to our website today, you'll be able to see that we've got design tips that will connect those 12-plus different wireless technologies to anything from a microcontroller that will sell for less than $0.25 all the way up to a full apps processor. So we really believe we've got a great position inside of that market, and we're seeing that inside of revenue growth inside of that business.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes. And I would just add, Gabriela, something that I think we noted even a quarter or so ago that the demand in the applications we're seeing, when we've peeled the back and looked at it, it is not at all concentrated in any particular application or customer. It's just a very wide range of customers and applications. The other thing I would say is -- I know a lot of times, you'd want to jump to, ""Oh, is it WiFi?"" or ""is it Bluetooth?"" or some of those more widely known standards. A lot of it is also what we call low-power RF technology. So industrial standards, for example, like ZigBee, that are really an important part of our strategy there and are being embraced by a wide range of customers.

The next question will be from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Ron, I had a question on gross margin. So you've done a lot of structural things over the last few years. You closed the fabs. You've always had a pretty big mix shift as the legacy wireless business rolled away. Most of these things are done: The fabs are closed, your business now is -- I mean, wireless is almost gone, about $50 million left. Is there anything left structurally that you can do on the gross margin front? Or is this primarily now about revenue growth and utilization in order to get the margins above where they've been recently?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, Stacy, no, I think there are quite a few, I'll call it, knobs that we can turn on the gross margin front still, first and foremost, which may not be fully appreciated and it's often very difficult to describe; it's just execution. I mean, there's a lot of, what I'll call, inefficiencies that cause TI gross margin that if we improve execution, we will see that benefit on the gross margin line. Another one I would throw out is it's only recently that we've shut down those 6-inch factories, which, granted, were not very highly loaded, but we also have 300-millimeter factories that are fully loaded. And so, as we shift more of our production into 300-millimeter, we've talked a lot of details in the past. But even compared to 8-inch, not even 6-inch, but just 8-inch or 200-millimeter manufacturing at the silicon level, not inclusive of packaging and test, there's about 30% cost savings when you go to 300-millimeter. So as we continue to ramp those factories and a higher proportion of our manufacturing is done in 300-millimeter, we will continue to see the benefit. Another thing that I would point out would be we've talked about several times that, as we look to how we can make TI stronger over the course of the next 5 years even, we see industrial and automotive playing the bigger role at TI, meaning we would like to have a higher proportion of our revenue coming from those end markets. In general, that tends to be positive for gross margin as well. So I think those are a few things that I've noted. Dave, if you can think of something else that stands out. But again, by no means do we sit here going back and saying we've done everything we can do. Now we'll just let the -- we'll ride the utilization curve. And by the way, that utilization curve is going to be very attractive for us because, as we've talked about a lot, we have -- I'll just be specific. We compared our last quarter to results from third quarter '10 when revenue was 15% higher in that third quarter '10 and gross margin was 30 basis points or so less. So we're operating at lower revenue. Importantly, utilization in third quarter '10 was 800 basis points higher. So as utilization continues to expand, that will be good for our gross margin. And we've got plenty of open capacity, and it's going to be very efficient capacity, as I said, because of the mix of 300-millimeter. So I'll stop there, Stacy, and if you have a follow-up.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I do. And actually, I want to follow up on that same point. So you've given us some color for how we should think about incremental gross margins going forward from here. And you kind of talked about it over the cycle, and I think the number you've given was something around 75%, which was sort of your average over the cycle. If all of that, that you just said is true and is going to happen, why shouldn't we be thinking about using a higher incremental gross margin going forward to figure out the margin trajectory with revenue?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I think, Stacy, I just -- as much as anything, what we're trying to convey with that 75% incremental gross margin is -- and I forgot the exact number of years. But basically, over the last, I don't know, 5 to 10 years of cycles for Texas Instruments, 75% incremental margin up-cycle and down-cycle is what we've averaged. And so, I think what we've communicated is that's probably not a bad assumption to make going forward. Are there things that we could do to elevate it to make it even stronger? Yes, absolutely. Are there things we could do to mess up on that? You bet on that one as well. But 75% is just kind of a historical number that, until we prove a different incremental margin, is appropriate going forward, that's probably the best we could provide you as a guidance point.
Operator
We'll move on to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Gabriel Ho
This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Just wanted to focus on the Analog segment. Can you give us more color on what you see by segments? And as we head into 2014, how should we think about maybe your Silicon Valley Analog versus your core Analog?
Dave Pahl
Yes. Gabriel, this is Dave. I don't have any breakdown by end markets for Analog. I can say -- nor any specific guidance for next year by each of the businesses. I will say that, as we've pointed out before, we're -- we just completed our second year of the acquisition of SVA, and we're actually very pleased with the performance. And again, we're about a year ahead of the schedule from a share gain standpoint. So we're happy with our performance. That doesn't mean that all the work is done, and there's a lot of people working very hard to continue that performance as we move into next year. And in general, we'd like to see all our businesses performing consistent -- performing consistently above end market or market growth overall. So that's what the would-be objective is. I think what you'll continue to see from us overall is, as Ron talked about, our investments going forward will be pointed -- or any increases in investments will be pointed towards the industrial and automotive markets, and that's where we see the opportunity. So that's true with the company, and it's obviously true with Analog as well.
Ron Slaymaker
Gabe, do you have a follow-on question?
Gabriel Ho
Yes. And on the wireless revenue, do you expect $50 million and also maybe essentially 0 as we head to Q1?
Ron Slaymaker
That's correct. So I think what we've said in October was that we expected legacy wireless products to be about $50 million of revenue this quarter and it should be close to that amount. So basically, we expect that legacy wireless revenue will only decline a relatively small amount this quarter compared with last quarter. And then, we expect that it would have a sharper decline in the first quarter, at which point that revenue will be essentially gone.
Operator
At this time, we'll hear from William Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Someone asked earlier about normal seasonality patterns in Q1, and I appreciate that you're going to leave that to us to analyze. But I'm wondering if you're seeing anything either in the economy or in your backlog or bookings rates that would suggest a deviation from what might be typical. Anything interesting from a, kind of, puts and takes perspective that would lead us to think things are going to be stronger or weaker than typical in the first part of the year?
Ron Slaymaker
So, William, I think, again, I'm going to reserve any comments we might make about 2014 for January and inclusive of first quarter 2014. So we're just going to keep our comments focused on fourth quarter at this point. Do you have a follow-on?
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Maybe given that you just gave a bit of an outlook on the legacy wireless business, I'm wondering if you can talk about what you're seeing in the comm infrastructure end market, given what's going on with the rollouts of 4G or LTE in China and the potential rolling off of 2G and 3G investments. Any commentary as to what you're seeing in that market?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Dave?
Dave Pahl
Yes. William, in general, I'd say that we're well positioned with all of the comms infrastructure OEMs. And so, where we will benefit -- and we are seeing a benefit from any deployments that are happening inside of China. And I would say that it seems that all the equipment providers are each planning to win all of 100% of that market. So we're seeing growth at some customers, while other customers are now going through and readjusting inventory levels that they've got. So in either case, in general, I'll just say that we don't expect that this market to be a really particularly big driver of our overall revenues and results one way or the other in the future.
Operator
We'll move to Christopher Rolland with FBR.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
So some of our recent checks with Asia, kind of, show a tail of 2 months. There was a bit of trepidation, I guess you would say, in October and then a slightly seasonal pickup in November -- better-than-seasonal pickup in November. So did you guys sort of see that pattern at all between those 2 months even mildly?
Dave Pahl
Chris, I don't think we -- other than the comments I made already, I don't think we really want to start to get into kind of month-by-month linearity discussions. So I'll just have to -- if anything, we may be able to give you more color on that in January, but not at this point. Do you have a follow-on, Christopher?
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
Okay, sure. So stepping back, bigger picture, I guess, R&D intensity, at least, as a percentage of revenue has sort of decreased from high teens down to sort of low teens. And SG&A has sort of done the opposite or at least gone from low-teens to mid-teens. So are these trends in your model solely caused by the mix out of wireless here, or there are some other things that play here? And how should we expect the mix between SG&A and R&D to sort of play out now that wireless is closed?
Ron Slaymaker
Christopher, I think that's -- what you observed is accurate, including the cause. So I would say, any adjustment in R&D that you've seen at TI over the past year is wholly attributable to what we've done on the wireless side or essentially in [indiscernible] . Similarly, SG&A, wireless just was not -- our operating expense in wireless was very R&D intensive. And if you think about it, you're dealing with a few very large customers. SG&A is going to be lighter. You don't need to do a lot of marketing. You don't have to have a big sales force to call on a handful of known customers. So as we have exited the wireless business, it's had a bigger impact on our R&D than it has on SG&A. And I think those results, especially once we report fourth quarter, will be pretty much all in. And that mix then that you'll see of operating expense is probably at a pretty stable level going forward. So it can vary somewhat between R&D and SG&A always, but -- and from quarter-by-quarter, but I think you'll have a pretty good view of the mix of this operating expense line.
And with that, we're going to shut down. Before we end the call, let me remind you that a replay is available on our website. Thank you, and good evening.

Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you, all, for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Executives
Rich Templeton – Chairman, President and CEO
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Why don’t we go ahead and get started. It’s my pleasure this afternoon to welcome everyone to the Launch Keynote. It’s my distinct pleasure to introduce Rich Templeton, the Chairman, President and CEO of Texas Instruments. We’re going to through a fireside chat, about 40 to 45 minutes in length. We’ll have time to open up to questions to the audience so please don’t be shy. So, Rich, I’ll kind of kick things of.
And clearly over the last several years, you’ve embarked on sort of the transformation of the company out of the digital space focusing on the analog embedded space. Talk a little bit about the rationale behind that strategy, we find it interesting because I spent the last day and half with some of your old competitors and they stand, are doubling down on that business right now. And so, maybe give us some perspective of the rationale behind the strategy, where you thought you would take the company and where have taken it over the two or three years?
Rich Templeton

John, you know when you called a close point. And really when you take the thing back, it’s probably 2006 and ’07, we sat back and we looked at where was, the world going. And we had watched enough things on smartphones and watched some of these vertical on SoC businesses, and we said that that’s not a great place to generate long-term returns.
And the great news is we’ve been building a very significant analog business, we’ve been building a significant embedded business and it was really said at that point, it really makes sense to specify time, analog and embedded, that’s a product statement. And it also is as you recall I think it was in 2007 we said the investment and leading edge CMOS was not going to be a game that paid off. And I think we got that one called right, we got that one called early. And we got those investments re-profiled as well.
So, in many ways those decisions while questioned at the time and painful because it took five or six years to get that revenue rolled off. And it was probably 30% to 40% of the revenue at the time, is why we have the company that we have today over 80% analog and embedded, strong generator of free cash flow and continuing to grow.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Relative to that strategy, it’s not that it’s just light at the end of the tunnel, you’re kind of acting in the end of the tunnel when you look at wireless as a percent of revenue today. And so I guess and the question I always get from investors is going forward, how do you prioritize your resources, and kind of what’s the strategy from here?
Rich Templeton

Yes. So, we’ve talked with investors for several quarters now. But really we started about – it was probably mid-2012, really taking a look. We saw the wireless completion coming to a close. And we said okay, let’s take a look over the next five years, what does a stronger TI look like. And we’re pretty sophisticated, we called it a stronger TI and really took some time writing down what would that next set of changes look like that make the company even better.
And some of them are reasonably logical I think, at least they are to us. Obviously, get to the percent of analog and embedded higher, that’s somewhat mathematical just with where we’re going. But it includes things like increasing the percentage of revenue that we generate from the industrial and the automotive market. It’s got increasing customer diversity, even though our largest customers are down to mid-single digits.
We want to get that diversity even greater, that’s about growing the tail of that curve. More investments and more revenue on the application specific and catalog business as opposed to the custom business, because those will pay better over the long term. So, we really spend some time going through what’s that next set of changes, or the portfolio getting even stronger.
And then really a lot of the work that we were doing underneath that what are the things that will make that happen. So, we have been really busy over the past year working on that next set of changes as opposed to just the drawing some of the decisions maybe five or six years ago.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

In the vein of what’s rewarded is usually repeated. As you kind of come to the end of the journey of divesting the wireless revenue, have you changed the incentive structure inside the company that I would suspect as you were winding that revenue down, revenue growth in other area might have had been a higher priority to try to fill the gap? And if you think about the incentive structure today, has anything dramatically changed now at the end of the wireless journey?
Rich Templeton

Yes. There has not been many ways in the days of public disclosure of the CD&A is pretty accurate for the way we think and the way we operate. And that is really to have a good balanced view across the senior leadership and that’s the same thing we take down inside of relative revenue growth, relative profitability, relative shareholder return. And then of course us subjectively sitting back looking at the leading indicators of how you’re strategically trying to change the company.
So, I think one of the benefits of having a pretty senior team that knows where they want to go, you don’t have to tweak around with the comp system on an annual basis. Because I don’t think that works that well. I think really having people passionate about building a more valuable and a more successful business long-term gets the best results and we’ve been able to do that.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Part of the success of the business model that you’ve kind of taken the cycle out of the business. You’ve focused in on long-duration assets, long duration end-markets, customer diversification. That said you are a student of the industry. And you guys are one of the first of analytics that you were back to put up that unit chart versus trend and were well below trend.
And yet we haven’t caught up. And so, maybe not from a TI perspective but more from an industry perspective, where do you think the growth rate is now for the industry and if it’s slower than past year why?
Rich Templeton

John, I think and you are the best one that commented on it. I think the past three years have been difficult but best for students or people that are disciples of the semiconductor cycles to try to make choices based on that. And I have no idea what all happened over time and in some ways I don’t care that much as you described, okay, as a company if it’s hotter or if it’s cooler, we know how to handle it and we can manage it accordingly. You have a little more to do whether without cycles.
So, I think those have looked very different, you haven’t had those 6 and 8 quarter pronounced runs that you’ve historically had. I don’t know if that continues or if it doesn’t on that front. I do still fundamentally believe that when you look at 20 or 25 year average that having unit growth of 8% or so, which is somewhere north of two times global GDP. I think it still makes sense.
Because I think there is still, if you just look at the end equipment, look at automobiles, look at industrial, there is more electronics in all our lives that’s not changing, that’s not decelerating. And I realize back three or four years that data hasn’t held. But when I just look at the trends around, I would still guess longer term that that’s the right growth rate from an unit point of view, and a dollar point of view. Because I don’t think GDP moves much.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

I know you guys have your Mid-Quarter Update next week, so I’m not going to ask anything near-term. But in the absence of not knowing – is looking at seasonality sort of the best way to try to model this cycle for the industry and for TI?
Rich Templeton

I think you’re watching it even through this last round of earnings calls where people have continued to be surprised by what were estimates out there and where were the companies guiding. I don’t think TI was alone in some of that dialogs.
And I just think where this one is coming back to is I’m not sure that the historical patterns are all that helpful. And so, we would probably just even think differently about the repeating of the numbers, yeah, the math may say that the average is something. I just don’t know how applicable that average has proven to be. And as a result I think you guys are going to have to find a way to set the expectations in a different way.
It’s not something that I worry about that much. And you led to some of that meaning, we’ve got a manufacturing strategy, I think, we made some wise decisions on the capital decisions, three, four years back that let us handle it if the market is hotter or cooler, we can stay pretty disciplined on the operating expenses so you’re not counting on growth absorb things along those lines.
And now the market growth would be what the market growth would be. And our objective internally is to make sure we’re doing better than whatever that market is. And if we keep the team focused on that, good things usually occur.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

On that front, over the last couple of years, independent really of the starting point. You can start to see green sheets of TI growing faster than the peers. And I’m kind of curious what kind of multiple or what kind of upside to industry are you targeting or should we think about because the analog market share changing is like watching paint dry. And it usually doesn’t happen all that quickly. So what kind of targets can you give us on that front?
Rich Templeton

Yes, I’ve been careful with targets instead just look back. And over I think past five or six years, I think we’ve added 30 basis points annually of market share on the analog business. I think embedded is about the same or maybe a little higher.
And in some ways people look at that, say, yes, gees, and that’s without national acquisition adding on top of that so it’s just organic. And like you had excess 30 basis points. Well, 30 basis points each year compounds and starts to really be a significant revenue impact.
And so we’ll keep everybody internally focused on running sales teams and better running product lines better, executing better, the things that we really do control on that. And if we could make that 30 basis points average behind, we certainly would. But so far, we’ve done – we’ve got a reasonably long-term track record of being able to outperform of that.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Returning back to the U.S. analog, you can always question the veracity of the data. But one of the things that really stands out to me in the analog space, which is the space to your point where pricing usually isn’t a big factor. When you map units and pricing, pricing has been horrendous. It’s the worst that we’ve seen I think in the 30-year dataset.
Now, my assumption is, a lot of that I consumer mix growing faster than industrial mix. But what’s interesting, every U.S. Analog guy I talk to says they’re not seeing pricing impression. Everyone except for you is having growth issues. My question to you is how you square the circle on why you think pricing is so bad, and quite frankly if you’re not being a price leader, why shouldn’t you be giving your cost structure?
Rich Templeton

Yeah, I think couple of things in that, John. First is, you somewhat led the witness with the comment of if you look at WSTS and the data, every time you drill a layer deeper, you go to less accuracy I believe. And I think you really got to be careful of just what’s in there, how is it reported. And when I look at things across TI or even look across the industry, I just don’t see a lot of blended average pricing change over a longer period or even a shorter period of time on that front.
And to me, the best way to verify that, which is consistent with the other analog companies that you mentioned is, do you see margin structure changing that much? And the answer to that is, no. Okay, so, I actually believe it remains pretty consistent. And it will tend to go up and down but that up and down is over a three and four year period, it’s not a short-term responsiveness.
So, I don’t think it’s changing that much, I don’t think it will change that much. And to the question of what the TI do, we’ll do what it takes to be successful. I just don’t believe in differentiated products that prices be elastic, variables that really determines the design wind or gaining that business on that front.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Well, not on a apples-to-apples comparable but why not go into end-markets that three or four years ago you might not have the cost structure to be in at the margin profile you want. Given the cost structure you have, why shouldn’t consumer become a bigger portion of your revenue because you could do it more profitably than just about anyone on the planet?
Rich Templeton

Well, I think when we sit back and we look over a five-year period at a stronger company, and you know the benefits as well as anybody on an industrial or an automotive mix improving, it’s going to be longer life cycles of both the products and the design winds, something like the structure that comes out of that.
So, we’re not deemphasizing or participation in personal electronics or consumer, we can participate in it, we can make good money in it, we can do a good job for customers. We would just like the percent of industrial and automotive to be higher on that. Because I think in R&D dollar invested that yields a product that could live for 10 years is going to be a better return than an R&D dollar that produces a chip that was through 12 or 18 months. And that’s what we’ve got to look at.
So, it’s not just industrial and automotive as I commented before, it’s also more investment into application specific or catalog. And if that application specific part or catalog applies well in a tablet or a smartphone, we’ll certainly do great business in those spaces. You’ll find us continue to be significant player on that front.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

When you look at the sub-category, we call IAI which stands for Industrial Auto Infrastructure, the AI it’s pretty easy to see content growth, the auto content growth in electronics, pretty easy to touch and feel. The infrastructure is kind of detail. Can you talk a little bit on the industrial side, which is sort of a catch-hold bucket, I mean, I’ve always seen a company say it’s industrial and they don’t know where it goes.
Rich Templeton

Right.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

But as you think about sort of the growth of content of the industrial, what are the top two or three trends that we should be focused on relative to the TI content growth in that bucket?
Rich Templeton

Yes, so, I think it’s very accurate statement the industrial is kind of everything else. When we spent time over the past year breaking that down, what are we going to do to increase and expand our growth rate even higher? We’ve really broken it down to the next level of sectors and then down to the next level of end-equipments.
And then, really if you go on even the TI website, start to see this TI designs data where we’re putting more technical collateral well, because you’ve got to do a better job supporting those customers. So you’ve got to get specific to do that well.
But to me you’ve got several examples that I think are somewhat obvious, it can range from things like the Nest lab thermostat, the world’s had thermostats for 60, 70 years, they just haven’t had a lot of semiconductors inside of them. And when you want to make and in the case of Nest, when you want to make a great learning and adaptive thermostat, you put semiconductor content in it.
So it’s got processors, it’s got connectivity, it’s got intelligence, it’s got sensors. And now all of a sudden, you don’t need unit growth of the industrial market but you’ve got significantly higher semiconductor content basically replacing electromechanical products. And just go across different leaders and industrial from the Emerson to the Grease in China, to the Schneider’s pick whoever you want.
And go talk to those companies, what are you going to do to make your equipment better or differentiated. And they want to lower the power or they want the service ability higher and that’s all about how do you add intelligence and that means semiconductors. And so be it John Dear putting guidance systems on tractors or air-conditioners that have Wi-Fi so the service companies can know what condenser, compressor to bring out if there is a problem. That’s where you start seeing more semiconductor content.
It’s never going to be the front page of an annual report, it’s never going to be on CNBC or news report but that’s just fine by me. I think it’s going to be actually a pretty important secular trend, because it will be very broad.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Returning back in the analog, historically a very fragmented market. I always think you’re the second largest player, the largest player is this guy called other. Where do you think the ceiling in market share is for a company like TI and if you look at sort of the trends around what customers want, has that changed over the last five years. And so there are views that actually your terminal market share could be a lot higher than you thought it might be five years ago because of serviceability, because of application, because of everything the customers are now demanding?
Rich Templeton

Yes, the simple answer, and it’s not to be believed, it’s just higher. And we’ll probably – I don’t know what it would probably be in 18% or something range depending on where all the data falls in as we continue to incrementally add. And we just need quite a bit of headroom, it’s a $40 billion something market on an annual basis, I think it’s the latest data I saw. And I think we can grow on that.
What I like about where the market is going and take to comments around industrial, they play many of the skills and this is not by accident, it’s by absolute design. Many of the skills we’ve tried to put in place, largest and broadest sales force. So you can get out very deeply across that customer base because no one customer makes up a big percentage, you’ve got to get these and you’ve got to get broad, a broad product portfolio.
So when you’re in that customer solving a problem, you’re not just getting a one ship off of that design, you’re helping them with the controller, the power, and the interface to whatever applications that they’ve got for that. So those pieces have really been put together by design and that’s why when you see additional technical collateral like this TI design work that’s gone now on the web, that’s what customers want, to make the job easy, to make it easy for them to design it in. And they’ll probably use as much of your product that helps them as competitive systems. So that’s the focus. And I think we’ll continue to see that share grow.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

When you look at your operational targets and your revenue targets, grade yourself on the national acquisition?
Rich Templeton

It’s one job that you know the data a lot of investors do, the percentage of larger acquisitions to pay off for anybody with a seller, is the notably in the 20% range. Somebody has also commented that we do one large acquisition every 10 years or so which is probably the right case to try to do those.
We felt very good about the national acquisition, take all the things we’ve talked about to date, industrial focus, great catalog products, great margin structure, talented group of people to develop more new products going out into the future. And by the way we could do it at a price that we can pay back or generate a return on capital.
And so, that thing really has done everything and a little bit more than we had hoped. We have talked, I think it was on the July earnings call, instead of the third year of growing faster than the market, we’ve been able to actually make that happen a year ahead.
As we take a look at the payback and the returns, they look like they’ll be just about on track. Done a little differently as Kevin talked about on one of the earnings calls but that’s encouraging to have an acquisition of that size that almost two years, I guess two years into it is well on track to be able to deliver on that front. So we’re really quite pleased.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Well, there is a lot of different ways to measure the return on investment. But if you look at the cost of the debt that you took on to do in debt, not equity so that you start for instance a lot lower back. Then if you look at the opportunity cost of the cash you gave up, and then you kind of back into what national generated, you can come up with an ROI of north of 20%. That’s pretty healthy ROI. Why not pursue more in organic growth activities?
Rich Templeton

Well, I think that as we’ve talked even with the Capital Management Update last, I think it was last February, we’re open to look at ones that made good sense and it would be very consistent. The industrial and automotive, it will be catalog, it will be analog, long-lived products. Because those are the ones you can actually handle any integration risk and get to the other side of bringing the companies together.
And by the way it’s got to be able to pay back, it’s got the capital within three to four years. So that’s the thing that we just got to pay attention as yes, there is others that meet those early criteria. But if you meet those criteria and the company is well run, it’s also well valued right now and accordingly, because it’s going to be a strong generator of cash.
So I think we’ve just got to be smart, I think generally we really take it very serious to be great stewards in terms of how we deploy capital and the return we generate. And even when we looked at the national deal we pay close attention to how accretive is buying back TI stock. And that’s integration risk free in terms of what that would look like on that front. So we’ll stay pretty disciplined on that.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Switching gears little bit to the embedded side. Often times investors focus solely on the analog and forget to check the login ones, it’s a pretty large business embedded. Every year this conference we do a survey of the investors here and just the investors on Wall Street. And what was interesting is this year, the most investible buzz word for 2014 internet of things.
Rich Templeton

I’d like to go the opposite direction.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

I tongue and cheek sometimes, you can’t spell it without IOT. But that said you do have, it’s very strong IP portfolio in the embedded market including some connectivity assets that you cap. So, do you think about the growth drivers in embedded versus analog, one, which one that grows faster? And when you think about embedded what’s the growth rate there?
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Yeah. I think in general with the business, the embedded guys are probably, I haven’t checked the data lately. If analog has been gaining 30 bps on an annual basis, I think embedded has been a little more than that, solid share gains annual. And I think those guys can both continue to do that.
Obviously, when you look inside embedded, the area that we’ve been heaving up the most, the past three and four years, and it’s for the right logical reasons that there is more customers and more broader applications as the whole microcontroller front. And so a lot of things that we’ve done with low power, higher performance with the 430 and the C2000 family great differentiated peripherals, the things that industrial customers really value and care about, those investments really are yielding and doing the things that we want to see.
We’ve got underneath grades of the connectivity business as you know. And I think it is a fascinating opportunity because you go to my industrial comments, if you want to make things more productive, if you want to make things more serviceable, you need to get them connected up. And it doesn’t just mean wireless LAN, it could be low power RF, it could be lower power Bluetooth or something like that.
And those end up working pretty closely with microcontrollers because there is most likely some processing that’s taking place inside that application. So in general, I think the connectivity thing is a much smaller business, so they don’t have higher growth rates, but microcontroller has to be the real driver growth long-term for grades business.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Same market share question around MCUs, I mean, it does diversify the end market as analog if not more so.
Rich Templeton

Little less but.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

The economics are fairly similar. Where do you think you can drive share over time. And I guess one of the things that I worry about not necessarily worry about because I don’t think they have the business structure to attack this, but some of the connectivity guys in the consumer market are the ones that are spending the most time talking about variables, talking about IOT.
But I struggle because consumer is one customer 100 million units, if you look at that IOT market it’s going to be hundreds of thousands of customers, maybe tens of thousands of units. So where do you think your market share can go on microcontrollers and how well positioned are you if IOT actually becomes the investible theme we all hope it will be?
Rich Templeton

Yeah, I think as you’ve seen on the total embedded number and the microcontroller one looks pretty similar and side of it. Obviously it’s share is lower than our overall embedded shares because we’ve got the benefit of the DSP position that’s historically been a great one for us.
I just think higher, when you’re – I don’t know, where 6% to 7% share, whatever that latest number is like that and it’s been building nicely, we have plenty of room to grow that number higher on that front that’s what the teams are doing.
And on the fact will there be people coming out of consumer markets trying to move into some of those higher profile variables or spaces like that I think the structural barriers will really be pretty solid long term. And this whole idea that our diversity is going to become one of our greatest defense barriers by having no one customer, no one socket or no one end equipment that makes up a high percentage or a significant amount of revenue, it’s no one space to attack.
And to do that, you’ve got to have a business model designed for that in mind. And that is about a large broad sales force, a large broad portfolio applications where you put in technical collateral into all those applications. It’s not finding two big sockets in the four customers per – you’re two big applications and the four customers that make up 100 million bucks. So I think it’s a very different set of DNA that the companies that allude out well will have is my guess.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

I referenced the analog SIA pricing data earlier, I’ll do the same on microcontrollers. Because actually if I look at the data, one of the things that really stands out to me is that microcontrollers is one of the few sub factors other than memory and memory is going through its own cycle dynamics where you’re getting unit growth and ASP recovery.
Now some of that is easy compared from last year but are we starting to see the 32-bit market, maybe some of these new applications actually there on, the overall pricing dynamics than microcontroller?
Rich Templeton

Yes, I would go back, it’s the same one. I don’t think you’ve got a pricing trend down nor up, on a mix weighted apples-for-apples or there is new products come out on that front. It’s just – I’ve not seen that a long time, I don’t see the dynamics changing even with what we observe right now.
And so as a result I don’t think that’s going to correlate, how are we going to find continued good growth with embedded. I think the answer is yes, just because in order to make this equipment more intelligent, to make it more differentiated, that would be about software that would be about microcontrollers that are embedded inside of these systems.
But I think what we end up bringing unique to that is it’s not about just the micro-controller the core, it’s what are the peripherals that you are putting around it that’s what customers really care about. And that analog heritage that we have where you can put great analog peripherals around great low power micro-controllers, couple it up with the power solution or the wireless connection, it’s the capability that none of our competitors in the embedded space have. And I think it’s one we’ll keep taking advantage of.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Is there a targeted mix of end-markets you’d like to see the company at three to five years from now, so if you think of consumer, auto, industrial infrastructure, how should we think about how you think the ideal mix should look?
Rich Templeton

Yes, no, I don’t think there is an ideal mix. I think as we looked at it even on that work on stronger TI, it’s just what a stronger mix look like. And so, we’ll have increasing industrial, increasing automotive, and obviously if those two are going up others will be coming down. I would imagine personal electronics would be a decrease in percentage. But it’s just because we think we can get better returns even on the industrial and auto side. So, I’m not one to have this specific portfolio of what that mix will look like.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Gross margins, do you still have some easy levers relative to underutilization charges you’re taking. Next year your still anniversary low CapEx from the ’09 downturn, but as you go into ’15, you should also have depreciation kind of rolling off. How should we think about, I’m not going to use the word target if you don’t like target, but if market share can just go higher, is the same sort of truth applicable to gross margins and profitability?
Rich Templeton

John, you know this well and it’s probably the best and when I say free cash flow, when you say gross margins, so it’s in many ways I think that’s the best way to help and the best to think about our business. So that is, as we said last February, a target of creating between or generating between 20% and 25% of revenue and converting it into free cash flow, we’re currently running 24% on a trailing 12-month basis. So, we’re pleased with that, it’s been a nice improvement. And I think it reflects a lot of the things that we’ve been talking about over the past five years of changing.
Now that said, you also saw with the third quarter of ’13 results we had said, I forget the exact numbers, it was pushing close to 55% of gross margin, 30 basis points or 40 basis points higher than the previous record. And we did it with I forget it was 8% lower utilization whatever the numbers are that I think.
And I think that just reflects the types of decisions and the types of, since we’ve made better products, increasing mix of 300 mm, fewer 6-inch lines, executing better. And those we’re not done working on, okay. So, we’ll stay very focused, all the things that I’ve talked about today, we keep doing them better, we should be putting better quality products across the company.
The depreciation thing to me is some people are fascinated by us, all just so because it’s already in the 24% free cash flow as a percent of revenue. So whether it’s on the income statement or it’s not going to change when it moves down from one line to the other on that front. But yeah, there is what, 3 basis points or 4 basis points that can move on that line alone but they’re already in the cash flow.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

I want to try to give you a backend of compliment by saying you guys have been better getting out of businesses than getting into businesses. And you stop me very quickly and say that’s not a backend of compliment you’re very proud of that.
As you look at the portfolio today, are there any businesses that you do worry about, and I guess the one that I could ask the most about is, what’s – you guys still have a relatively good presence in the hard-drives from the controller side. I mean, what’s the future of that market for TI?
Rich Templeton

I think in general the answer is, we’re in a really good position if you think about the five or six years that we’ve been working on. And in some ways depending on how long student to TI is the 50 and the 20 years, we’ve not been afraid to take the hard efforts to get into better businesses.
And you and I’ve talked in the past, I just – I really have got to that very simple point like, you work just as hard in good businesses or bad, and the only difference is the good businesses have a lot of return. It’s hard work to do it, and it’s not always popular but I think it really is rewarding.
And so we’ll continue to stay on that but I think most of that heavy lifting is done – which I think is something our investors like to see. There is always going to be portfolio work and portfolio work, and portfolio work could be if an area is not going to grow as fast it ought to have less resource on it. So you could have something like a described business with the preamps and the servo controls.
And if you have an opinion that describes they’re not going to grow that fast then they ought to have less R&D dollars going in at that point in its life. And so, across the portfolio, we’ll always be working on things like that. But to the magnitude that investors observe with the wireless changes, the great news is we’ve got those lines.
"
2013-12-03,Q&A," Session
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Any questions from the audience? Very quiet this afternoon. Maybe I can continue. Part of the dividend strategy that a lot of semiconductor companies have embarked upon has been relatively always pleased by investors especially given for the tenure on this. What’s interesting is now it’s cool thought that maybe yield start to go up significantly next year.
If that were to happen, do you think your cash return strategy would change at all, would the uses of cash change, i.e. more buybacks than dividends or quite frankly is there a point in time when we’re actually doing acquisitions with that cash is better than giving it back to the shareholders. How do you think about that?
Rich Templeton

I think we try to lay out and it was really very conscious set of thoughts as we presented last February, pretty formal overview of the capital management strategy. It’s kind of the reason we wrote that down as we do believe that something that you can really embrace for an extended period.
And by the way we’ve got some credibility because what we’ve been doing for the past five or six years looks incredibly like it is well. And so, as we look out as you think about what we’ve designed in analog and embedded business, which carries with it a low capital demand manufacturing structure, which then couples up with a tax strategy that says you’re going to generate significant cash, get it back to where it can be used or returned.
Those things all connect together. And you can’t just do one part of those, okay, in terms of how it works. And as we put that together, I think what we end up offering investors is a very unique generator and return of cash. And so the plans that we’ve got is we’ll continue down that path with about 50% of the trailing 4-year free cash flow towards dividends. And yeah, Kevin views judgment about just what that means, it won’t be absolute precise with the calculator.
And then the balance of that would be used for buyback, lessening debt and the caveat that we put on that one is old decisions that got to be accretive or they’ve got to be smart buyback. And I think we’ve probably shown pretty good discipline over the past, now I guess going on eight, nine years, we’ve really stayed pretty consistent, you saw us in the market even in really kind of tough scary years like 2009. And those buybacks really have been very accretive. We want to be good stewards of that cash and invest it in a way that’s earning its cost to capital I think we’ll be doing that.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

I would say that the risk here with TI is more duration than fundamental. I think at a long enough time-horizon as an investor you’re going to get paid no matter what price you get in on. There is not much of a fundamental risk. The least is – they are harder to find. One that goes will remain it’s not a 1:3, but 3:5 or even greater than that it is that China threat.
I mean, if you look, to me it’s becoming clear that there is a mandate in China that there is going to be a China recovery, we want it to be China made as much as possible. Semis in general, I think are insulated from that at least in the near term, because either it’s entry, not a lot of local supplier. But if you think about the Chinese analog players, they are nipping at the heels of the low end, on the consumer side, guys like reached that you’ve competed with for many years. How do you handicap that threat, not only in the next one to three years but maybe over the next three, five or greater?
Rich Templeton

So, John, we spent time and I forget it was a year ago, two years ago. But we spent quite a bit of time really going through I think its 12th 6-year plan, we called out the 11th 6-year plan and really as a leadership team went down through what all the plans were, what all the intentions were.
And you can get some pretty good insight if you spend time studying that why the semiconductor industry or semiconductor companies can go operate with wholly owned subsidiaries in China because they don’t have alternatives and why things are different than other industries. So you can make sense of it on that front. Would they love to have a different outcome, you say to the answer correctly, it said yes we would. But they stated that five years ago they stated that in the 10th plan and that’s been stated for a while.
The other perspective that I add to that is the Taiwanese semiconductor industry has been trying to move in that direction for a long time. I say 20 years, because I can go back to the late 80s personally and know a lot of the companies that were starting up at that time. And I’m going to go to the word all, even though it’s kind strong, all continued to be very vertical, very big volume, most revenue per R&D dollar, working on the high-end personal electronics, smartphone, tablet, display whatever that is.
And I think we’re going to see and we continue to see the same trends even in some of the aspiring Chinese companies that are trying to stretch out. And it’s hard to tell what’s the Taiwanese company and a Chinese or an U.S. listed company for that matter. So we monitor them closely.
But you’ve really not watched any of them get to critical mass, and respect Richtek but they’ve gone very vertical as you know with those investments. And it’s probably the right thing for them to do because they don’t have a sales force, they don’t have breadth of portfolio. And I’m not sure if that time-horizon the things they’re going to try to go invest to make up.
So, we watch it, we have it on the list of things, as you can tell, we pay attention to. But to date you really haven’t seen the momentum go buy that.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

I’ll pull the audience one more time for a quick question upfront.
Unidentified Analyst

Hi Rich, I remember you buying the fab $0.10 a S$1, which is great. So, I’m curious how that some of these – your thoughts on sort of that the fab list thoughts and how you’re strategizing thinking about that adverse to peers?
Rich Templeton

In many ways it’s not a religious decision or a philosophical one, it’s just how can you do the best job when you’ve got 100,000 part types ship over 20 billion units a year, how do you bring the best service, the lowest cost and the best continuity of supply to all your customers.
And so, when we sit back and look at the manufacturing and technology, it’s really in some ways a foundational capability to be a leader in analog and embedded. And it’s actually one that if you look at our really very good traditional analog or micro-controller competitors, they’ll struggle as the world goes below 0.35 or 0.25 to where they’ll be putting more of their capacity on the outside. And so I think this will actually be a really fascinating asset that gets stronger over time.
I don’t see one of our analog competitors building a 300 millimeter wafer fab any day soon because they could house multiple bumpers of their company inside one of those fabs. So they just won’t have the scale to play quite the way that we’re able to. So I think it’s one that over time you’ll see as continue to use it, use it well. And it will continue to emerge as a great competitive advantage.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

Great. With that we’ve ended our time. And I thank Rich for spending time this afternoon. And I thank everyone for joining us.
Rich Templeton

John, everybody, thanks.

Steven Chin - UBS
Hi, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for attending the next session here. My name is Steven Chin, and I'm one of the semiconductor analyst here at UBS. For this next session today, I have the pleasure of introducing Texas Instruments. And from TI we have Dave Pahl, who is the Director of Investor Relations. Dave is going to go through a couple or some prepared remarks, and then we'll have a Q&A session afterwards.
With that, I turn it over to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thank you, Steven, for having us this afternoon. I thought I would start off with just giving an overview of TI and kind of where we are, and if you followed the company over the last five years or so, you know that we've been a company that has been transitioning and a transition that is essentially complete at this point in one, two markets, in analog and embedded processing. And this last quarter about 80% of our revenues were generated from those two segments.
And the reason we like analog and embedded processing is for a couple of reasons. The first is that they're both very large markets. The analog market is about $39 billion in size last year, embedded processing is about $17 billion, so combined just shy of $60 billion worth of market cap.
If you look at our position in each, we hold the number one position inside of analog. We've got that number one position and really only about 17% or 18% share in it, so lots of room for growth. In embedded processing, we've got a number two position, and there were about 14% share and again lots of room for growth.
The other thing that we like about those markets is they tend to be very fragmented and they're fragmented from a customer diversity standpoint. We service over a 100,000 customers. We've got a 100,000 products in our portfolio. So we service the very long tail of that.
And part of the reason why we have so many customers is that analog and embedded processing goes into like anything electronic. So it plugs into a wall or runs off of a battery, there is typically a product that we can sell that company and that provides a great opportunity for us.
The other thing is that both of those markets have a long track record of strong financial characteristics. So it has stable margins. There is, we like to think of it as, multiple modes of competitive barriers around those markets. So you don't see the major players moving or changing very much. It's a market where it's hard to enter into and market share doesn't move around a lot.
The other thing is that the products tend to last a long time. It can be decades or even multiple decades in some cases and you can manufacture those products on mature manufacturing equipment. And the net result of that part and part of the attractiveness of the financials is that generate lots of cash. And that's one of thing obviously we like about those markets.
So we think with that focus and now that that transition is complete, TI is in a unique position as a tech company to grow, generate and return cash to shareholders. If you look at our ability to grow and you look inside of the analog and embedded processing markets, those are markets that they're big enough, that they'll probably grow about the same rate as the semiconductor market.
More recently, we've had lots of debate of what that the rate of growth will be, it hasn't been very stellar certainly over the last five to seven years. Hard to describe the last five to seven years as normal with all the things that we've been through. But we generally believe that that those markets will grow somewhere around twice the rate of GDP. So it might be a little less, a little bit more, but somewhere in that area.
If you look at what we've done from a share gain standpoint, over the last four to five years we've gained about 30 basis points of share. In some years we've gained as much as 100 basis points, another year it's been at low as 10, but it's averaged about 30 basis points or so. So we've been able to gain share. And again, share doesn't move quickly in these markets and that's both a good thing and a bad sign. But because the markets are so good, just gaining 30 basis points of share will add a couple of points to our growth overall as an entity.
The other thing, if I move from grow and looked at our generation of cash, basically we believe we've built an engine that can generate between 20% and 25% of free cash flow off of every dollar that we generate and that's an average trailing 12 month number. If you looked at our last quarter, we just generated 24% of free cash flow. And free cash flow is defined as operating cash minus CapEx on that standpoint. So very strong generation of free cash flow.
And probably the most important part of that is we've committed through our capital management strategy to return a 100% of that free cash flow to investors in the form of dividends and buybacks. And when studying that dividend policy, we basically look at the average of the past four years' free cash flow, we take the 50% of that and that's what we targeted for dividend.
We've got a track record over the last 10 years of increasing our dividends. Each of the last 10 years, we just increased our dividend in October by 7% and I believe that was a 41% increase over the last year on an annualized basis. The remainder of that cash will buyback shares. If you look over the last 10 years, we've taken down our share count through those share repurchases by 36%. So a very meaningful reduction in shares overall. So again the commitment to return a 100% of free cash flow.
So now when we look forward, what we're focused on and spending our time doing is just completed this pretty significant transition in the last 5 years. So when we look forward over the next five years with a kind of envision where we want TI to be, and we see TI as a company focused on analog and embedded processing, and incrementally will increase our investments and industrial and automotive and focus those incremental investments in those markets.
So one of the things that we're doing is an example, and I like to describe the industrial market, that's long been defined electronics, what it's not. So it's not a consumer, it's not computing, it's not communication, it's not automotive, it's everything else. And we're going through a process of looking at over a dozen different sectors inside of our industrial.
And those sectors are things like medical or process control or building automation or motor control, those types of sub sectors, and we're looking at our investments across those to ensure that we're maximizing our opportunity to see how we're and where we're making our investment.
So that's what we're trying to do I think, and it was in a couple of minutes. And with that, maybe I'll take a seat and try to turn over to Steven.
Steven Chin - UBS
Thanks for that summary, an overview of the company space. I was thinking to start with some of the questions this afternoon. Just in your guidance for the current Q4 quarter, the midpoint of your guidance was down 8% sequentially. I think roughly half of that was from seasonality in your education segment.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Steven Chin - UBS
And also the other thing that kind of set out to me was the lack of inventory build happening with a distributor and channel customers.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Steven Chin - UBS
Would those dynamics in mind, looking beyond that and maybe to early next year, is that potentially setting you guys up for a better than seasonal type of demand outlook or trends go into next year?
Dave Pahl
I have no idea. Yes, I think when we look at fourth quarter and we try to judge the down 8 and that a signal that we were in a demand environment that was getting weaker. And I think that's certainly one of the first things that come to your mind when you're looking at a number like that.
And we looked at order rates and typically when you have a shift in demand, order rates will fall off pretty precipitously. And on an absolute level, our orders actually grew in the quarter by 1% that you were talking about. Book-to-bill is of course less than 1%. When order rates grew, you typically see a spike in inventory and distribution and we took a day out of inventory as you were talking about.
Cancellations remained at a low level really historically low, so didn't see any activity there. Rescheduling, just the anything unusual that you can typically see in a demand environment. So pricing is normal. Lead times are stable. So all those ancillary things that you'd look at I'd say is in demand shifting. And our conclusion is that really isn't.
When we look at that down 8 and you'll look at the variability over the last four, five years and we've had years with typhoons and floods and all kind things that have happened. So there's been no normal year. And that down 8 doesn't seem like an unreasonable number to just to finish the year at inside of that.
So what that means for next year, but I'll tell you we haven't had a typical year I think in the last five. But typically what we've seen over the last few is that orders tend to be stronger in the first half and then weaken in the second. And that doesn't mean that that's going to happen this next year, we don't have any visibility into that. But that's the pattern that's kind of repeating this year as well.
Steven Chin - UBS
That's fair, because I know that the seasonality combined with other exceptional factors over the last five years, the high and low range for each quarter is quite significant.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Steven Chin - UBS
Based on some of the products cycle that you're discussing in some of your R&D investments, like longer term are there certain end-markets that TI thinks that it will have more secular growth trends than what you currently are seeing?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think that a couple of ways to answer that question. The first is that we're trying to build a business that isn't tied to anyone end-market. And if I contrast to the company we were five and 10 years ago, we had over about a-third of our revenues in wireless. We had customer that represented 20% of our revenues in a couple of products, and that's lot of fun when things are growing and going up, it's not a lot of fun on the other side of that.
If you look at our company today, we don't have a customer that's more than mid single-digit percentage of our revenue and our top customer buys more than 800 products from us. And the largest devices is less than 1% of our revenue. So it just speaks to diversity of our revenue base. That's part of the reason why we like industrial and automotive. And that we actually do believe that there is in a secular trend and that will benefit us.
And if you look at inside of automotive, the areas that we're strongest today tend to be two areas, one is an area called ADAS or advanced driver assistance systems. So that kind of shows up in systems like blind spot detection, that's getting more common in cars today. You are starting to see some cars that have collision avoidance with forward and backward radar systems.
You are starting to see some vision systems that will pickup collision avoidance, people walking in front of the car, lane detection, so if you begin to view it from the lane, you will get a hectic buzz on the steering wheel or it will actually steer you back into the lane. And then of course, you've seen parking assist in some cars and the ultimate of that of course is the driverless car, which there's lots of people working on that. So we're right in the middle of that.
The second area is in infotainment and it's both center console as well as console display inside of that. So there is lots of areas, there is lots of ancillary areas like most cars are going from the mechanical button to touch buttons inside the cabin, LED lightings, signal lighting as well as inside of the cabin.
There is lots of communications and interfaces that are necessary inside of a car today, both wireless and wired connections that were participating. And there is motors that are going from fluid-base motors to electric motors that need drivers and controllers and then the whole EV opportunity with battery management that plays well for our Wheelhouse.
Steven Chin - UBS
I think the electrification of different systems within automobile I think that's an important theme that a lot of your analog peers have talked about also. I guess going back to real your comment about TI has been able to consistently gain an incremental share each year. Can you talk about how within that, the electrical with the power steering or brakes they will support, and so forth, how you guys are able to win out over your peers, whether it's just content or you're actually seeing?
Dave Pahl
I think what's true in the automotive space also it's true in the industrial space. So if you look at when an engineer starts a project and the very first thing that they can do is a sort of web and search. Search the web for devices. And we'll typically get a significantly higher amount of web traffic through our systems, just because not that our website is prettier than everyone one else's, it's because we've got more devices.
So if someone wants a microcontroller, they're probably going to look at ST, they'll probably look at a microchip, they're also going to look at a TI. If they want to power product, they'll probably look at linear tech because they're also be searching at around the TI site. If they're looking at some type of signal chain products, the converter or an amplifier, then they'll look at ADI, but they will also be looking at that TI.
So we'll get early use into when customer start designs and our sales force is really focused on identifying, when a company actually starts a design, or call it a design kick off. And when that happens we pull basically experts from around the company, identify across the catalogue of are 100,000 devices, which few devices are going to make sense for that customer to evaluate to look at, and in some cases actually design parts of those sub-system for them, and when we do that, of course those are chock full of TI component as a starting point.
So it's ability to kind of look across the whole system and we're not just trying to design in the microcontroller or just trying to design in the converter or power chips, we're kind of looking across that, so we can just extract more content for design. And we believe that that is a really nearing, if I would say, great products with great ability to market, that's probably the sustainable advantage that we've got at TI.
Steven Chin - UBS
And looking at the service, the junction between your embedded processing division and also analog products, so obviously low power devices and mobile devices, digital power management seems to be increasingly use the liquid type of analog power management. Can you talk about what TI has in your product portfolio from a digital power management perspective and where you see that growth trajectory going?
Dave Pahl
So digital power management, I think it was kind of six or seven years ago, there was an incredible amount of hype with that marketplace and part of it is true. Whenever you see some smoke there is fire there. And probably got overblown, but we've got a very strong presence inside of that. And as you've said there is a natural crossover of some level of control for power that plays into align the microcontrollers that we've got that's targeted specifically at that as well as power product that communicate to those processors inside of that environment.
So have some insurance, but some things like temperature, work flows and other things to manage power and larger system. So that's been a great market. It's certainly not the hype that we probably had five or seven years ago, but it is I think a definition of kind of the power market, very fragmented, lots of opportunity and you bring a unique solution into that market and customers value that, they will pay for that differentiation.
Steven Chin - UBS
How about in your microcontroller business, where you have both the MSCR picture for the [indiscernible] family and you have arm recortexed to the higher [indiscernible] kind of things. What does your market share look like there and why are you guys winning out and taking share there?
Dave Pahl
I think if you look at microcontroller specifically, I think from industry analysts will have us in the mid-single digit percentage, like 5% or 6%, somewhere in that area. And microcontrollers, you know we've talked about for a couple of years that we decided that that was the market that had the characteristics of businesses that we like, that have long product cycles, that take a long time to enter into, customers tend to reuse the products once they decide to use them. And it was an area that we weren't particularly strong, so we stepped up our OpEx investments several years ago to begin to build-out that catalogue of products and that's shown up inside of our EP segment from an operating margin standpoint.
And we've had that investment going for couple of years. Now we're starting to see some the growth layering on top of that as a result to those investment. So it really is investments and building up that portfolio as well as in application engineers in the field to go support those products, the development tools necessary to get them fielded. And again, just like an analog market share doesn't change very quickly, but we're seeing some very, very encouraging progresses as we moving forward in share again.
Steven Chin - UBS
Just switching gears to gross margin, you guys have done a phenomenal job on the gross margin lines past couple of years, even with your capacity utilization being at modest level. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of work went in that maybe you guys have at least sort of mid-50s gross margins even though revenue run rate wise is 10% below prior peak gross margin or where you were revenue wise at the mid-50s gross margin?
Dave Pahl
I think this last quarter, we just had a record gross margin quarter and the last time that we passed a record, I think it was third quarter of '10. And so this past quarter we delivered 54.8% gross margins, we had 54.5% I believe in third quarter of '10. Revenues were 15% higher in that quarter and capacity utilization was 8 points higher in that quarter as well. So basically we have more open capacity. And if you remember third quarter '10, we were chasing up demand of off of the bottom in first quarter of '09. I don't think anyone expected that we were going to have this type demand trajectory that we did.
So we were shipping everything that wasn't nailed down in that quarter as we chase demand. Where I'd say last quarter, we delivered solid results. Our factories aren't distressed and we just have better machines to be able to respond to that demand today. The other thing, obviously, is the quality of the products that we're shipping.
Back in third quarter of '10 we had still a significant amount of legacy wireless revenue that we were shipping and this past quarter we were down to about 2% of our revenues were in that, so just the quality of that product has increased. I think analog and embedded processing was about 60% of our revenue in third quarter of '10, where this past quarter it was 80% of our revenue.
Steven Chin - UBS
And going forward, the incremental gross margins on future sales growth, is 7% roughly the rate number to look at or do you think there is an opportunity to grow that even more, depending on which way the products sales mix shift between analog and embedded processing.
Dave Pahl
On incremental gross margins?
Steven Chin - UBS
Incremental.
Dave Pahl
So I think that when we looked at our past performance, we've looked at from a trough to a peak and looked over 15 years and just took the simple mathematical average of what happened to incremental margins, both in up and down market. That actually the mathematical average was exactly 75%. I don't think in any quarter inside of that 15-year period that we ever delivered 75%, but that was the average.
So we think that that's probably a pretty good place to start. In some of those quarters we had different product mixes that were going on and shifting around. It certainly didn't comprehend some of the shifts that we've had with the wireless products moving out as an example, so that would tend to help it.
The fact that we were able to buy a large portion of our manufacturing assets for pennies on the dollars and put that capacity in place allowing us to spend 4% of our revenues on CapEx and keeping that low using comprehended and those types of numbers either. So those things will benefit it over a cycle as you run, but I think 75% is probably good place to start, when they're doing the modeling.
Steven Chin - UBS
And just going back to an earlier point I brought up, which was the low inventory and also call it short lead time environment now out there, the reluctance of channels to build inventory and that said obviously requires faster response times from higher specialty results.
Dave Pahl
Right.
Steven Chin - UBS
Going forward if this type of behavior persist, is there anything that TI needs to do continue to better able to response this type of operating environment? And what kind of efficiency you think that might have for the overall business margins?
Dave Pahl
I think if you looked at structurally what's happen to our inventories and how we've set up our manufacturing is pretty significantly different from five and 10 years ago. We added a day of inventory, I think we finished last quarter at 106, up from 105, and we believe the right range to run the company is between 105 and 115 days overall. So we're at that lower-end of that range.
And one other thing that we're doing now that we weren't doing five years ago is we are intentionally building inventory of long-lived products that run in low volumes in periods of weaker demand. And we're doing that because, as an example, a piece of assembly test equipment it may take 30 minutes to set up that equipment, whereas you're going to run 10,000 parts or 1 million parts. And it may take let's say 30 minutes to run 10,000 that may be a year's worth of demand.
So why not run three years worth of demand and put it on the shelf. And you get all of that downtime kind of out of the way when you have weak demand. So when periods of stronger demand come, you spend that 30 minutes on something that's going to sit there and run for a day or two days. And so that has affected our inventory profile and we you do that on products that you've got confidence that you're going to sell for five or 10 years, where the risk of obsolescence is very low.
The second thing that has impacted our inventory profile is consignment and we've got 45% of our revenues on consignment, where we're actually holding on our balance sheet inventory sometimes rate on customer premise, we actually don't get an order or carry any backlog, but we've got electronic systems that feed our systems, tell us what demand looks like. And when they go to the cage and operate off of that demand and pull the days worth of inventory that they need, we then get the order at recognized revenue.
So our order book doesn't give us the visibility that used to in that past, but we've got this other system that provides us visibility. But because of that we're carrying more inventory overall than what we use to. But we view that as a good going, because we are controlling more of that inventory and we can match demand more closely to our customers need and that whole consignment inventories worked out better than I think we might have thought when we first entered into it.
Steven Chin - UBS
I'm going to take this opportunity to open up the questions to the floor, if there are any?
"
2013-11-19,Q&A," Session
Steven Chin - UBS
Your communications business last quarter or so I think it was all sales.
Dave Pahl
At close to mid-teens.
Steven Chin - UBS
Just given the big weight spending that a lot of other communication IT companies are waiting for right now. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you saw in this most recent quarter and the guidance for Q4 remind us what that range of products you're pitching to that market. Is it only DSPs or are there other high value analog products involved?
Dave Pahl
So the last part of the question, we sell both DSPs analog and we have both signal chain as well as power analog and interface product, timers, clocks and other things, so a pretty broad base of analog products that we're shipping to that market as well as ASIPs. So we ship all three of those categories into that market.
In the near-term I think that, well if I'll go back, I think it was third quarter to fourth quarter 2010, when AT&T went to buy T-Mobile and put in their bid, our revenues in that business dropped I think something like it was almost 40% sequentially. And really since then we've been six month away from growth happening in that market for three years.
And the good news is we've actually begun to see some growth. We saw growth in first quarter that we believe was primarily driven by CapEx spend by U.S. carriers, and then that began to broaden in second and in third as with what was spent from China operators. But believe me we've got a really good position in that market.
It won't make a significant difference to the TI's financials, one way or the other by how that market performs, but it's one of those markets that the growth come, won't come, we don't have any good insight until whether it will or not, but when it does we'll have the product ready to ship.
Stephen Chin - UBS
And just from a competitive standpoint, I think there are a lot of competitors in that market that are coming up with SoC-type designs where in a lot of cases there is a DSP element that's integrated into a multicore processor. I was wondering if that's a trend that you've seen start to affect your business at all. And if not, I guess where are you able to continue holding on so you can grow your DSP business?
Dave Pahl
If you look at the most recent product category that we've launched, it's a architecture called KeyStone and if you tear apart and look at that architecture, you'll see that there are both ARM and DSP subsystems that's been inside of that as well as host of hardware accelerators. And the great thing with the KeyStone architecture is that it's scaleable and it can do a full LTE plus all of the fallbacks, necessary at the macro cell and you can run the same software all the way down to small cell.
And so it gives both our customers as well as operators confidence, eliminates the issues of coexistence and things like that, that others have had struggled with. So there we've had competitors that have had integrated solutions in the past. We don't know the market that exists without competitors, and there is alternate ways to do that solution. So we don't anticipate that we'll standalone, but we feel good about our position today and going forward.
Stephen Chin - UBS
We have a question in the back.
Unidentified Analyst
[indiscernible].
Dave Pahl
So I'll repeat the question for any of those who are listening, it's just the center console opportunity in automotive. What we'll do there as, the products that we'll supply are things from the applications, processor, part of our OMAP investments for refocused into that area. We'll sell actually other controllers, embedded processors into that space as well.
There is, of course, a whole bunch of analog that's dragged along with that as well as connectivity solutions as the center console wants to be connected to your phone and to other devices. The content I think will vary, but I'll speak to it maybe as a more generally, in a car today and my understanding is that there is about $250 of semiconductor content on average in an automobile.
If you look at a high-end car that may sell for around $100,000 today, my understanding is there is about $1,000 of content inside of that. So when I look at that $100,000 car, only 1% of its content is going to electronics. It's a pretty small percentage. And if you look at how manufacturers are differentiating their product and their ability to differentiate it, based on the electronics inside the cabin, the look and feel, it's pretty high.
So will that $250 go to that $1,000 or move in that direction, I think most industry analyst believe that it will. And then I think the belief is, that that market will grow somewhere in the low-to-mid-double digits, so 10% to 15% range in an environment where the semiconductor markets maybe growing 6% to 8%. Does that answer your question?
Stephen Chin - UBS
Yes. In terms of your capital return strategy, I know the target that you mentioned, I think it was at roughly half of the historic run rate for free cash flow would be allocated towards the dividend?
Dave Pahl
Right.
Stephen Chin - UBS
What kind of events or I guess changes in your overall financial model would we need to bump that up for opportunities for the further, maybe a more aggressive capital return strategy?
Dave Pahl
Well, I think 100% pretty aggressive overall. And so it's hard to go above that or being above that, but I think that that's when you look at how you divide that up, we've got investors that value a dividend and some of that would like a all-in own dividends as maybe you're suggesting as that percentage goes higher. But we also have our large numbers that actually prefer to have share buyback.
And there is good reasons to like both and we like to listen to both, and certainly we don't have a hard and fast rule, that we've always got to be 58% forever in the future. But we pick that balance. The ones that like the share buybacks, like to see a consistency in the share buyback.
If you look over the last 10 years, I've talked about, we've had more of a steady hand and we've reduced our share count by 36%. So it's been a meaningful reduction in share count and for those that do like it, they view it as a very tax-efficient way to return capital to them. And the dividends kind of speak for themselves, so there is lots of advantages to the dividends as well.
Stephen Chin - UBS
And just touching upon the M&A strategy, talking about analog or National Semi that was your last big deal. Going forward, can you talk about what types of strategy or what other targets you might have in mind from an M&A standpoint?
Dave Pahl
So I'll start with the conclusion, which is a large acquisition unlikely, but I'll kind of backup and say what types of things will we look for and you really think about National it kind of fit, follow this criteria. One is we want a company that's products are centered up on the analog market, having a high exposure to industrial and automotive, that they have a large number of catalog products that have long lives, they have a diversity of customers that they shift those products to.
Those products are differentiated and therefore generate nice margins. They're able to manufacture among long-lived assets, so their CapEx remains low and they generate lots of cash, and then we want to be significantly under valued. And so there is lots of companies that kind of fit maybe those first criteria, but that last criteria is obviously a harder thing to match. And we look from a financial perspective, we look at multiple metrics, but one metric that we look at is can we exceed our cost of capital in a three to four year timeframe.
And two years in the National acquisition, we're very confident that we're going to be able to do that. But you look at our a lot these other properties that kind of fit that criteria. They're all pretty well-run enterprises. They generate lots of free cash flow. They've got strong balance sheet. A lot of them are run by either founders of near founders, so there is no for for-sale signs out front. And so the ability to step in and put a premium on top of that, you just can't make the numbers work.
Stephen Chin - UBS
And just probably one last question for me. From a competition standpoint, obviously there has been a lot of growth happening in Asia, and I think a lot of, call it, low cost analog manufacturers have spread it out that a couple of times.
Dave Pahl
Yes.
Stephen Chin - UBS
Do you see them much at all in any of your business segments? And also from a computing end-market standpoint, I think that's still a relatively healthy percentage of sales for TI. Do you see any pressure from that market because traditionally certain markets have seen an [indiscernible] in margin structure, and then some of your analog peers have migrated to other higher-value segments within analog. Kind of wonder, if you are seeing I think from a low-cost …
}
…migrated to other higher value segments within analog. Kind of wonder if you're seeing some low-cost, call it, Asia-peer standpoint?
Dave Pahl
So I think first, you wouldn't to be in our industry and ignore what's going on in Asia, you do it at your own peril. So it is something that we watch. We've seen multiple companies attempt to do to enter the market, probably the most successful, would be someone like a [ph] Ridgetech. And there they will find an end-market that's perhaps is closer to home and they'll appoint a development team at a very specific function. And so we'll typically go up against them more directly in our high volumes analog business.
They've got great designers and they've developed great parts. We have that too. They've got low cost structure. We've got a low cost structure. So we can compete pretty effectively against them. What you don't see is competitors investing in a broader catalog of products, kind of take five and 10 years to get into those markets. We really haven't seen any activity on that front.
Steven Chin - UBS
With that, I'd like to thank everyone for your attendance at the TI session today, and take care, Dave.
Dave Pahl
Thank you.

Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for December 9. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.
This was a good quarter for TI. Revenue came in just above the midpoint of our guidance range, growing 6% sequentially and growing 10% if you exclude legacy wireless revenue, which declined to less than 2% of TI revenue in the quarter. Analog and Embedded Processing increased to 80% of TI revenue. The improved quality of our revenue is reflected in record gross margin in the quarter. Kevin will discuss this more in a few minutes.
Revenue growth in the quarter was supported by some of the vertical markets that were especially weak in the second quarter, including computing, game consoles and handset revenue outside of our legacy wireless revenue. Revenue from the communications infrastructure market continued to grow in the quarter. These areas were complemented by a continued strength in our automotive and industrial revenue.
From a year ago, revenue declined 4% due to the decrease in legacy wireless revenue. Excluding this revenue, we grew 3% from the year-ago quarter. On this basis, this was the first quarter of year-on-year growth since the third quarter of 2012. Again, excluding legacy wireless, we expect growth to accelerate to 8% in the fourth quarter at the middle of our guidance range.
The strength of our business model not only provides strong profitability, it also gives us confidence that we can sustainably generate $0.20 to $0.25 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. This metric is especially important to our shareholders as our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to them, except what is needed to repay debt. When measured over the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was 24% of revenue. Over that same period, we returned 133% of free cash flow to shareholders. In the third quarter alone, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases.
Earnings in the third quarter were above our expected range, a result of better-than-expected revenue and gross profit, tight operating expense control and some help from discrete tax items.
Let me walk through a few details of revenue. Analog revenue grew 11% sequentially. All 4 Analog product lines contributed to this growth, although Power Management was up the most, followed by High Volume Analog & Logic. These areas benefited from sequential growth across many markets, including those vertical markets that were impacted by inventory reductions in the second quarter.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 8% sequentially, with processors up the most, followed by growth in microcontrollers and connectivity. Processors were driven by applications processor sales into consumer and automotive applications and DSP sales into industrial applications. Microcontrollers were lifted mostly by sales of MSP430 products into industrial applications, as well as sales of microcontrollers into automotive safety applications.
In our Other segment, sequential growth in both product areas was offset by decline in legacy wireless. Legacy wireless revenue fell by $91 million to $57 million as we had expected. This decline was partially offset by growth in calculators and in custom ASIC revenue, which grew as a result of communications infrastructure. Royalties also grew, and DLP product revenue was about even.
Turning to distribution. Resales grew 9% sequentially. Distributors' inventory levels declined by about a day to just over 5 weeks.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, gross profit was $1.78 billion, up 13% sequentially. Gross margin was a record 54.8% of revenue and expanded 330 basis points sequentially. I think it is useful to compare this quarter's gross margin to that of the third quarter of 2010, wherein our last high-water mark for gross margin was set at 54.5%. In that earlier quarter, revenue was $3.74 billion, up -- 15% higher than our revenue this past quarter. Factory utilization in that earlier quarter was 8 points higher and our manufacturing capacity was lower since we have not yet brought online our cost-efficient, 300-millimeter analog wafer fab in Richardson, Texas or our yet to be acquired wafer fab in Chengdu, China. We were also still in the early stages of ramping our recently acquired Aizu Japan wafer fab. In addition, Analog and Embedded Processing were also much smaller then, contributing 60% of our revenue at that time.
The conclusion one can draw from this is that due to the structural changes that we've made at TI over the past few years, the quality of our revenue is much higher today. It is more diverse, more profitable and less capital intensive; and we remain better positioned to support future growth from a manufacturing capacity standpoint.
Continuing to operating expense. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $833 million was reduced by $27 million sequentially. Acquisition charges were $86 million, unchanged from last quarter. Almost all of this amount is the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a noncash expense. The restructuring charges and other line of our income statement transitioned from a $282 million gain last quarter to a $16 million charge this quarter. As a reminder, last quarter's gain was due to the transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer. This quarter's charge is associated with the shutdown costs from the previously announced factory closings in Houston and Hiji, Japan.
Operating profit was $844 million or 26% of revenue. Our tax rate in the quarter was 23%, a point below our 24% annual effective tax due to discrete items that were included in the third quarter. Our annual effective tax rate is unchanged and 24% is the rate you should use in your models for the fourth quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $629 million or $0.56 per share, which includes $0.01 of discrete tax benefits.
Let me now comment on our capital management strategy, starting with cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.15 billion in the quarter. We increased our inventory by $6 million compared with the prior quarter. Inventory days increased by 1 day to 106 days, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $124 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $1.03 billion.
On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.27 billion, about the same as a year ago. Trailing 12 months' capital expenditures were $402 million, down 27% from the year ago. As a result, free cash flow was $2.87 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 24% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period, within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue. In the year-ago trailing 12 months period, free cash flow was 21% of revenue. Capital expenditures for the past 12 months were 3% of revenue. Our continued low capital spending level is a direct result of the strong capacity position that we have built with our strategic investments of the past few years. The cash flow that will result as we continue to fill up this capacity should be stronger in the years ahead.
I'll note that depreciation expense for the past 12 months exceeded our capital expenditures by $496 million. As a percent of revenue, depreciation was more than 400 basis points higher than our capital expenditures. This is one of the reasons why our free cash flow has been trending higher than our net income. Of course, as depreciation declines at the rate of capital spending over the next few years, gross margin will benefit. Another reason why free cash flow has trended higher than net income is the noncash amortization expense of $80 million to $85 million per quarter, that will remain on our income statement for another 6 years. For the past 12 months, amortization expense was $339 million or about 3% of revenue.
And as we've said, strong cash flow, particularly cash flow -- free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. In the third quarter, TI paid $308 million in dividends and repurchased $734 million of our stock. Our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders, except for what we need to repay debt. In the last year, we reduced our debt level by $500 million. Free cash flow was $2.87 billion and we returned a total of $3.82 billion to shareholders or 133% of free cash flow. We've been able to return more than our free cash flow because proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, totaling $1.28 billion over the past 12 months, have also been an additional source of cash for the company. To break out the cash return, in the past 12 months, we repurchased $2.7 billion of our stock or 95% of free cash flow. Similarly, we paid $1.08 billion in dividends or 38% of our free cash flow.
Fundamental to our cash return strategy and our cash management and our tax practices, we ended the third quarter with $3.59 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that amount owned by TI's U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely onshore, it's readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI orders were about even sequentially and our book-to-bill ratio was 0.97, consistent with seasonal declines in the fourth quarter.
We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.86 billion to $3.10 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would decline 8% sequentially, with about half of that decline coming from the seasonal drop in calculators. The remainder of the decline is consistent with the semiconductor industry's pattern over the past 3 years: 2010, 2011 and 2012, as well as our own history over that same period when legacy wireless revenue is excluded. In the fourth quarter, legacy wireless products should decline to about $50 million. We continue to expect that revenue from these products will essentially be gone as we enter next year. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.50.
In summary, we believe the third quarter provides a preview of what TI is capable of producing as a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing. The improved quality of our revenue is evident from the higher gross margin and free cash flow generation compared with our past. We also believe our top line performance and potential will become more evident without the steady headwind of declining wireless revenue in the past few years. Our manufacturing capacity position remains strong and we have a good opportunity for continued growth, while maintaining our capital expenditures at lower levels in the years ahead.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
"
2013-10-21,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Ron, I guess my first question, just relative to that consumer bucket of computing, gaming and handsets, can you just give us a sense of how much that represented of the overall business in the September quarter and how much that was up versus the rest of the businesses sequentially?
Ron Slaymaker
John, probably the best I can do is help you understand the weight of each of those segments. I don't have the growth broken out by each of those areas for you. But let me just kind of go through real quickly the weighting of our end market exposure, which I can let you then play with to make some assumptions on. Comps in total were 27% -- and this is first half '13 data -- computing, 23%; industrial, 23%; consumer, 11%; automotive, 13%; and education, 3%. So again, the reason we called out the 3 areas was because I think in second quarter, we called them out as especially weak. And in fact, we also said that in our outlook for third quarter, we expected that they would recovery -- recover. And keep in mind, the reason they were weak in the second quarter was because customers in those areas were depleting inventories ahead of the anticipated new product launches in second half, which we are now well into. So those new product launches were what was driving -- were a factor in those areas that was driving growth. Again, comms infrastructure was already strong and growing in second quarter. It continues in third quarter; as was automotive and industrial, strong second quarter continued as well into the third quarter. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I do. This is for Kevin. Just on the incremental gross margin, Kevin, if you look at both the June and September quarter, your incremental gross margin, both quarters were over 100%. I guess I'm just kind of curious, to what extent was that just the wireless business declining? Do I think about a 30% type gross margin there? And then more importantly, when the legacy -- when the wireless business is down to 0, how should I think about incremental gross margin from there?
Kevin P. March
Yes, John. On the -- I'll answer the last part first. The incremental gross margin from our analysis in the past, over the course of the cycle averages about 75% up and down. In any one quarter, it really actually works out to that number tends to be pretty noisy in any one quarter but over time, about 75% and that's what we do for internal planning purposes. As it relates to the most recent quarter, you're right, the fall-through was about 106%. So it's certainly a pretty rich fall-through. And part of that was mix, but part of that also was improved factory utilization as we had higher revenues this quarter than the prior quarter. And so consequently, we had a slight utilization benefit as well.

Next, we'll go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Maybe from a high level, if you can just talk about now that we have -- you definitely showed increasing year-over-year growth. September was up and then December accelerating, although off of a pretty easy compare. For the full year, Analog growth seems more like a few percent. So if you could just talk about now that we have a full picture for the year, do you think there's anything going on in the Analog bucket? Or do you think that this is kind of representative of what the overall market is going?
Ron Slaymaker
Blayne, I think the year is not done and right now, there's kind of a lot of point spreads being made for our fourth quarter but we really need to wait until we get into January to understand what the final score is. But I think we feel pretty confident that 2013 when the final scores are in, we'll show market share gains once again for TI. So again, we have to push through the fourth quarter but we believe, just as you've seen over the past few years, once again, we'll be gaining share in 2013 for Analog overall. Do you have a follow-on?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division
And then just if you can provide some color as to within the segments in Analog, which one you're seeing the -- if there's any material difference between the subsegments. It looked like Power was up a bunch, if I have my numbers right, in September, if you could talk about the growth driver there. And then where you see the biggest declines into December.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I think in the case of Power, Power had a strong quarter. But also, you used the term earlier, easy compare. It was one that's probably more impacted by weakness, so the inventory reductions and some of those vertical areas in the second quarter. So in the third quarter, its growth was very broad-based, but it also benefited from recovery in some of those vertical markets and then I would say the same for HVAL. So if you look at third quarter, probably because those vertical markets layered on growth to what was already a reasonable base of industrial and automotive, Power and HVAL both grew faster than the catalog spaces of HPA and SVA. Yet I think if you go back to first half of the year and especially second quarter, you probably saw more relative strength in SVA and HPA. So I guess to put it all together, they're all pulling well in terms of growth in 2013 thus far. We'll see where it takes, again, where we go through fourth quarter. But some quarters, you've had more strength out of SVA or HPA and other quarters, as in third quarter, more coming out of Power and HVAL. Okay, Blayne, thank you for your questions.

Next, we'll go to Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Kevin, can you give us an idea of what sort of we should be thinking for the other operating expenses? I know it seems to be moving around. I do know you had the assets last quarter. But x the asset sale, still a reasonable bit of spending there, can you give us some idea of what we should be budgeting for next year in terms of that line on the income statement?
Kevin P. March
Doug, I'm going to try to make sure I've got what you're asking for. OpEx overall for the company, our model is to run between 20% and 25% of revenue, depending upon where we're at in overall revenue demand. And most of that spending is actually inside the Analog and Embedded Processing segment. So it's relatively small levels of ongoing support spending inside the Other segment, a little bit of R&D inside the Other segment for DLP technologies. But other than that, pretty small. The larger numbers you'll see passing through the Other as we go forward will be the continued amortization of intangibles, which will run about $85 million a quarter as we go through 2014. And that will eventually decline into about $80 million a quarter. And keep in mind, that will stay there for 6 years until that finally winds down. In addition, that falls through where we tend to record any restructuring charges. So the restructuring charges that we just had this past quarter, over $16 million, and those also were recorded in the Other segment. As we look into the fourth quarter, I'd expect that you'll see acquisition charges continue at about the $85 million, $86 million level. And you'll see probably a final restructuring charges associated with the closure of our Hiji and Houston factories of about $20 million in the fourth quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
And Doug, I think if you look at the income statement for the company, all of the -- for the entire period of comparison here over the last 4 quarters, all of the acquisition charges and restructuring other line are directly from that Other segment. So with that, you can then, if you want to extract that out to see what R&D and SG&A trends have been in that Other segment, you'll see both -- you won't see them independently. But the combination of R&D and SG&A has gone down whether you look at it year-over-year or whether you look at it sequentially. And again, a large -- that's largely driven by the reductions in legacy wireless as Kevin noted. All right, Doug, do you have a follow-on question?
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Yes. For my follow-on, if we look at the Embedded Processing business, that business growing nicely but not necessarily delivering the operating margins of the corporate average. Can you talk about what you're doing as far as the operating margin leverage to that business?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Doug, as you may recall, we spent a couple years significantly increasing our investments in that segment, particularly as it relates to microcontroller portion of that particular segment. We've taken that spending up to a level now that doesn't need to increase anymore. And really, what that business unit has focused on is the top line growth. They get rather attractive gross margins off their -- off the parts when they ship them. It's really about diversifying the revenue base and getting more overall top line growth to fall through to the bottom line. That's really what you just saw quarter-over-quarter. It's that top line growth came through rather nicely to the bottom line.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Doug. Thanks for your questions.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
First one is on operating expenses for the quarter. It looks like you guys saw OpEx decline about 3% versus the original guidance for down 2%. Wondering if there's any timing or any -- or how you guys were able to do better than your original guidance, and what the expectation process was?
Kevin P. March
Yes. So since -- OpEx, we did guide to down about 2%, but we're able to keep a pretty tight handle on spend in the quarter and so it came in a little bit lower than we had originally planned, which, frankly, just dropped by to the bottom line and produced extra earnings per share for our shareholders. As we look into the fourth quarter, we typically have some seasonality in the fourth quarter, what with the holidays for Thanksgiving and during the Christmas break. And so we'd expect to see OpEx probably decline somewhere in the 3% to 5% range as we move into the fourth quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Do you have a follow-on, Stephen?
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Yes, one question on the Embedded Processing division, particularly the microprocessors. So with the MSP430 that you mentioned, I was wondering, is the consumer or wireless segment an area where you're looking to be more aggressive on expanding the sales of your MC products?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I think probably the way to think about it, Stephen, is probably the biggest driver of growth for microcontrollers will be industrial. These are catalog devices that go into lots and lots and lots of different applications. That being said, we're not -- if there's growth in other end markets or growth opportunities in other end markets, we'll certainly pursue them. But our expectation is that industrial will likely be the largest driver going forward. And that's for the microcontrollers. For the processor side of the business, I would say we would expect comms infrastructure certainly is part of that revenue and an important end market for us. But similarly, we sell DSP products into lots of different applications. And the broader applications are going to be just as important, maybe even more important, than communications infrastructure going forward. And that's not -- that's not anything negative about communications infrastructure, it's just we have great market share, very high market share already in communications infrastructure, where there's still a lot of opportunity in some of these other areas for us to experience not only the rapid growth of that end market, but also rapid market share gains as well. Okay, Stephen, thank you for your question. And one of the things I should further delineate is when I'm talking about industrial likely being the fastest grower for microcontrollers, let me also more broadly include automotive in that as well, because that is a great opportunity that we're very well positioned with those products there. Okay, Stephen. Thank you.

Next, we'll go to Tristan Gerra with Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Your R&D spending as a percent of revenue is fairly low relative to some of your high-value peers. So what leads you to believe that you can maintain the growth, gain market share and the mix? Or do you think that there's a possibility of poising [ph] your R&D over time?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Tristan. Let me just, again, remind everybody of the R&D that you're seeing for TI. The R&D spend that we've had in the Analog segment has been at a pretty consistent level versus the revenues of that business for quite a few years now. And the fact of the matter is, the reality is, that, that R&D spend is being converted fairly efficiently into revenue growth to the point where that business continues to outgrow its competitors and gain market share each year. So I would offer to you that, that's actually a very efficient organization when it comes to our R&D spend. I can't explain why some of their competitors have to spend as much as they do. Similarly, in Embedded Processing, we've increased the spending over there, as I mentioned to the last question, over the last couple of years, largely to expand the opportunities that we can pursue in the microcontroller space. And so after bringing up that level of spending for a couple of years now, I'd say it's high enough at this point. And we now need to see it start converting into real revenue growth, which we're starting to see early signs of. When you look at total TI R&D, it is coming down product sharply. And that's purely a function of us winding down the legacy wireless products, including the announcement that we had that we're closing some of our operations and sites as it relates to that and that will take our total R&D spend down as we go forward. But on the core products of Embedded Processing and Analog, I have no hesitation of being comfortable with the level of R&D spend that we have in those areas today.
Ron Slaymaker
And Tristan, let me also just offer, in the Analog space, I would argue we're probably spending more than any of our competitors. You're looking as a percent of revenue, but if you look at absolute dollars, yes, yes, we're bigger in terms of revenue, but we're spending more than any competitor that I'm aware about in that space. So it's not like we're not investing in that business. We're investing quite heavily. All right, do you have a follow-on, Tristan?
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Certainly. And that's very useful. The part of your business that's non-consigned business, so distribution, is your Q4 revenue guidance embedding shipments about in line with end demand? Or any variance that you can mention relative to end demand and sell-in?
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, Tristan, I don't know that we have a real breakout in terms of the outlook between consigned versus non-consigned. We're really looking at it just in terms of what we shipped in -- or what we're shipping into that channel. So I don't specifically know the answer to that. I will point, if you just back to third quarter anyway as a reference point, I think we said TI's total revenue, excluding the legacy wireless, grew 10%; and our resales or sales out of the distribution channel, grew 9%. So you saw a very close alignment in the third quarter. I just don't have any specific data to share with respect to fourth quarter. The other thing I'll say, even with third quarter, we had a decline of a day of distribution inventory level. All right. Tristan, thank you.
Operator
And next, we'll hear from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I had one quick one on OpEx. Your R&D guide for the year still puts you about $1.5 billion, which would not -- which you said OpEx will be down like 4% and the midpoint of that would imply R&D down like 12%. Are you just rounding down to that $1.5 billion? Maybe could you give us a little more color on your expectations after the R&D and the assumptions around the OpEx?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Stacy, we do round to the nearest hundred million on all of these guidance numbers we give you, be it R&D or CapEx or any of the others. So in fact, there will be some rounding [indiscernible] there. But keep in mind also, the OpEx guidance I gave includes SG&A as well. And we will see that decline in the fourth quarter, really, on the seasonal patterns I mentioned a moment ago with the holiday periods going on.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I do. And just around, again, gross margins. It sounds like you got a bit more restructuring left over from the 6-inch fab closures in Q4. Have the benefits from those closures fully impacted gross margins? I think, in total, it was supposed to be about 75 basis points. And if they haven't fully impacted yet, can you give us some feelings for the trajectory of that impact on the margins?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Stacy. What we talked about when we announced that we were closing the -- those 2 over-6-inch factories is that once each one of them was closed, we'd see about $50 million per factory of cost savings on an annualized basis. One of those factories did close at the end of the second quarter, and the other one should close here in the fourth quarter. So we're beginning to see -- excuse me, third quarter. So we're beginning to see in the third quarter already partial benefit from that, and we should begin to see the benefit from that second factory closure materialize in the fourth quarter. So going into next year, we'll begin to see that $100 million of annualized cost savings as a result of closing those 2 older factories.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Stacy, thank you.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
First one, just on the Q4 outlook, I just wanted to make sure if there's been any downshift or conservatism regarding Q4 outlook. Because I think heading into the quarter, there was an expectation that looked macro trends are improving. Industrial businesses are doing better. There is this comms infrastructure build that the broader Analog industrial players would be able to give above-seasonal guidance. Maybe it was optimism. But since then, we have just seen sort of seasonal or slightly below seasonal outlook from Linear, from Cypress; and now, you're also guiding somewhat below Street expectations. So my first question is, has there been any conservatism regarding Q4 outlook? And specifically, what segments do you think will be at seasonal patterns versus below seasonal patterns for Q4?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Vivek. I'll go ahead and make some comments on that and let Ron add some additional color. But the -- if you take a look at our guidance, the midpoint of our guidance is down about 8%, third quarter going into forth. About half of that is just the seasonal decline that we normally get with the roll-off of the calculator business. So the other half is pretty much attributable to our underlying semiconductor business. If you take a look at -- we actually believe that, that's probably quite seasonal and, in fact, quite consistent. If you take a look, as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, 2010, 2011, 2012, the semi industry as a whole, excluding memory, in fact has seen fourth quarter declines from third quarter in each of those past 3 years. And based upon the guidance that we're hearing from some of the other competitors, ourselves included, it looks like we're stepping up for our fourth quarter of -- a fourth year of 4Q declines. In fact, if you take a look at TI and extract out the wireless revenue, you'll see that our revenues have gone down in the fourth quarter of each of those same years, similar to the industry. And in fact, when you just do the simple math during those last 3 years for the industry, it's down about 4%. So in fact, I don't think that we're suggesting that there's some changed outlook or changed future. In fact, I would offer to you that fourth quarter appears to be shaping up quite normally to us. When we take a look at our third quarter orders, they were actually up about 1% sequentially. Our distribution inventories, as Ron mentioned, were down about a day. And they remain quite lean with our distributors as well as our other customers. Our cancellations remain very low, and we've had no unusual requests for backlog push-outs. So when we put all that together, that suggests to us that the fourth quarter is shaping up to be a normal demand environment, similar to what we've seen for the last -- certainly the last 3 years.
Ron Slaymaker
Vivek, I think the other thing I would just add is even when we talked to you at the mid-quarter update, I -- somebody asked questions about order trends and I remember saying at that point that orders quarter-to-date have been strong. Book-to-bill was above 1, but that we expected that to slow as we approach the end of the quarter basically as we -- for a couple of factors. One, just seasonality in general, both calculators as well as semiconductors. So don't -- was there a slowing through the end of the quarter? Yes. But also, we expected that slowing would occur, and it pretty much happens almost every year and certainly has happened, as Kevin just pointed out, each of the last 3 years. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes, Ron, a very helpful clarification. So as my follow-up, I just wanted to make sure. Kevin, did you say that tax rate for Q4 will be 24%; or for the full year, it would be 24%? And then the real question is on dividends and buybacks, I think you mentioned that they have been at 133% of free cash flow over the last year. How long can this stay at those level? And should we just expect them to turn back to whatever, closer to the 100% targets that you have outlined as a longer-term target?
Kevin P. March
Okay, Vivek, the 24% effective tax rate is what you should use for the fourth quarter. With the various things occurring during the year, the entire year will be a little bit different than that. But for planning purposes, use 24% for the fourth quarter. I would remind you that, that tax rate includes the R&D tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of this year. And it's unclear whether or not that will be renewed by congress in a timely fashion as we get into 2014. For us, that provides about a 2% benefit to our taxes. So absent that R&D tax credit, we'd be closer to a 26% tax rate as opposed to the 24% that we're suggesting that you use for fourth quarter. As it relates to buybacks, I would just mention that, again, the reason it's been as strong as it has been, the buybacks and dividends at 133% of our free cash flow, is a function of not only improving free cash flow, which we certainly have seen, but also the benefit the company receives when employees exercise their non-qual stock options. And given the increase in the -- in stock prices this past year for our company, we've seen an increase in employee stock option exercises. Just to give you a few numbers and summarize that to kind of recharacterize what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our free cash flow for the last 12 months was $2.87 billion. Proceeds from employee stock options was $1.28 billion. So that means we had sources of cash over the last 12 months of $4.15 billion. We used or returned to shareholders, in the form of dividends and buybacks, $3.82 billion. Then we paid off debt earlier this year of $500 million. So we've used a total of $4.32 billion. So we've virtually used all that we have generated this past year. And we do that because one of the things we mentioned our capital management strategy is that we have a model for how much cash that we carry. And to the extent that we generate cash beyond that model level, we're quite comfortable with returning that to shareholders, as we have been doing. As to the ability of that to continue to run at those high levels, that's a really hard call. I would say that stock options do expire over time, and these are generally 10-year stock option grants that are granted to employees. So quite a few of these options are quite old, and they get used up. So I would expect that as we move into the future, we're apt to see less extra cash coming in from stock option exercises, but I think it's almost impossible to try to forecast the magnitude of that change.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
I was hoping you could comment a little bit on Silicon Valley Analog here in terms on where we are in your 3-year plan and if you don't have it available this quarter, would it be possible maybe on the quarter update to talk about what revenue is there, just so we can see where it was relative to where you guys acquired it?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Steve, I would say with the Silicon Valley Analog, first off on the point of revenues, we disclose revenues at the segment level. We don't disclose revenues below that, so we won't be offering the actual revenue figures for SVA. But if I were to talk about where are we at with respect to our expectation for SVA versus when we acquired National Semiconductor, I would say that the overall revenues are probably a little bit lower than we had initially expected at this point in time, given the overall market environment that we've been faced with this past few years. However, the rate of progress on share gain has been quite a bit faster as we've mentioned during the last call, that those product lines are actually gaining share about a year faster than we expected. In addition, we've had more cost synergies than we modeled into the acquisition. We've had lower interest expense on very low cost that we've been able to issue, and we've had substantially -- substantial benefits from taxes as a result of the acquisition. So when you put it all together, the profit that we're achieving on the National Semiconductor portfolio today is very close to what we have modeled at this point in time. And so I'd say we're reasonably satisfied with that bottom line effect.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Steve, even though we don't break out revenue quarterly, I can give you a kind of a rough breakout for the subsegments of Analog for 2013 year-to-date: so HVAL, 35%; Power, 25%; and then HPA and SVA are each about 20% of total Analog revenue. And again, that's year-to-date. Do you have a follow-on, Steve?
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
And just if we could follow on in terms of overall acquisition strategy in general. If you look at the microcontroller business, overall, it's still fairly fragmented out there. And also on the Analog side, you guys have talked a lot about gaining share and perhaps accelerating that through acquisition. Is there anything substantial you guys might do on either side there to change your position in any sort of substantial way at this point? Or is it more organic growth from here?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Steve, I think that most of our growth for the foreseeable future is going to be organic. To the extent that we do continue looking at acquisitions, given the valuations that we presently see with many companies out there that might be an attractive addition to our portfolio, it's difficult for us to look at what we might have to pay for some of those acquisitions and actually get a reasonable return on the investment for our shareholders. So that suggests to me that to the extent that we are doing acquisitions, they're probably going to be smaller tuck-in ones that probably come with reasonably good product lines to fill in holes that we have or talented engineers to help with our R&D efforts. They're probably going to be biased towards Analog. One of the problems when you go into the microcontroller side, you start getting different architectures into your family of products and that can add complexity that may not be easily leverageable. That's not to say that we wouldn't look there, but that -- these are the odds that you'd see our microcontroller are tuck-in kind of acquisitions.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Steve, thanks for your questions.
Operator
Next, we'll go to David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David Wong
Your guidance for EPS and revenue this quarter, does it assume that gross margin will be flat to slightly down with the lower revenues? Or does gross margin keep rising?
Kevin P. March
Yes. David, I think, inherently, with the revenue decline that we're expecting in the fourth quarter, we'll be reducing the loadings in our factories a little bit. So you'd expect underutilization charges will probably increase a bit and have a corresponding impact on gross margins declining a bit in the quarter.
David Wong
Okay, great. And a minor administrative thing, you noted that your cash is largely onshore, so you have no problem returning to shareholders. How do you get your tax rate down to 24%, so far below U.S. tax rate and still generate primarily U.S. cash?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Well, I would -- first, just comment that I don't really our tax rate is all that low. 24% is an awful lot of money to send to the tax collectors. But that aside, tax inherently are pretty complex and there's a lot of things that can affect the tax rates. And especially a company's somewhat unique global footprint. Our footprint on a global basis, including the benefit that we got with the National acquisition, is allowing us to have a relatively effective current tax rate and further enabling us a pretty high repatriation of cash, which, as you know, [indiscernible] of our cash home and we just ended this past quarter with 82% of our cash onshore. But for planning purposes, as we look into the future, we assume that the U.S. tax rate stays about the same incrementally at 35%, and we just model that on a go-forward basis from a repat standpoint. Our objective, again, is to maintain 80% or more of our cash onshore, so that we have it available to use for our shareholders or dividends and stock buybacks.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. David, thanks for your question.

Next, we'll go to Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
First off, for Kevin, so you have about $4.2 billion in long-term debt, and I think you have about $1 billion in note payable. Can you just remind us what your plans are right now as far as paying back that debt, especially timing?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Tore, we do have a short-term debt of $1 billion, that comes due on May 15 of 2014. We had talked during our capital management strategy discussion back in February that debt, clearly, is going to be a portion or part of our capital structure for quite a long time, especially given that we've got debt that goes out as far as 10 years out. And that, in fact, we will continue including debt in our capital structure or rolling over portions of our debt if the economics made sense. And to us, the definition of the economics making sense is if we can issue new debt at rates that are either below our impression of what the inflation rate will be or below our dividend yield. So with that in mind, I can't forecast exactly what we'll wind up doing when May comes around. But clearly, we'll be prepared to pay off that $1 billion if we need to. But if the economics makes sense, we may very well decide to go ahead and just replace that with new debt.
Ron Slaymaker
A follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes, a follow-on for you, Ron. I don't know if you'll answer it or not. But can you give any comment on which end markets will do on a relative basis in the December quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
No, but I will give you a consolation and talk about what they did in the third quarter. So in the third quarter, this is not a fourth quarter comment, industrial, as we pointed out, grew and continue to be strong. Automotive grew for us, being driven mainly by infotainment and advanced driver-assist systems, such as blind spot detection, parking assist, a lot of those cool things you see on car commercials these days. And I aspire one day to have a car that actually does that. Computing, notebooks were weak and tablets grew. I heard some competitors talking about weakness in tablets. Don't know where that came from. They were strong for us. Comms infrastructure, the big word was China in third quarter. Operators, in fact, started deployment, released contracts. 2/3 of those contracts went to China OEMs, 1/3 to European. I'll note we sell to both. And maybe different products to different players, but we expect to continue to enjoy participation in that China business. Small cell trials are continuing. What I would say is first deployments, we expect to happen probably, call it mid to second half of next year. Handsets, probably the good news there is now, sub-2% of our revenue is legacy wireless, keeps going down. Consumer, good recovery in revenue there after some of the inventory reductions in second quarter. It's probably a game console comment mostly. Digital television continues weak. So again, sorry, I didn't answer the question, but hopefully, there was some value there. Tore, thank you for your question.

Next, we'll hear from Patrick Wang with Evercore.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
Just one question for me. Can you help us understand the underutilization charge in Q3, what you see for utilizations in the fourth quarter, I guess, in terms of that charge? And then also, what you plan to exit the year with in terms of inventory, both on the balance sheet and in the channel?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Patrick. The underutilization charge in the third quarter was about $70 million. That's down from about $100 million in the prior quarter. And as I mentioned, with reductions in our factory loadings expected during the fourth quarter, I'd expect that charge to go up. But I won't give you a forecast with an exact number just yet. That will be a function of exactly what our [indiscernible] will turn out to be by the end of the quarter. As it relates to inventory, our model for inventory is to carry between 105 and 115 days of inventory. We just closed the current quarter to 106 days. So we've got room that we would probably want to take those days up a little bit more. And with the slowdown in demand in fourth quarter, that seems like a -- and a slight opportunity for us to first go ahead and bring those inventory days up a little bit, as we get ready to enter 2014.

Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
I apologize, I don't want to put you in the spot, but I'm getting a lot of emails and I'm confused, investors are confused. Going back to the mid-quarter update, I think you did say that long-term seasonality is 8. But then you also said the variability is a lot. So the right way to think about it is a decline up to 4% for the last 4 years, so the last 4-year average. And so, is it that we misinterpreted that in what we're thinking? Not that I was modeling for down 4%, but the Street was clearly higher than me so and hence, they're very close to ask that question. Did we misinterpret your comments or did something change in the quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
I think the key to looking at that, Ambrish -- and all of that is exactly true. If you look at 5-year average, it's down 8. If you look at the last 4 years and take, I think it was fourth quarter '08 out, it's down 4. I think what you hear us talking about here are if you look over the last 3 years. I think in case of the industry and TI, both were -- excuse me, it's something like down 9%. And so I guess the difference is just that -- the only real difference in terms of how we're discussing our own data is I think a meaningful change to say, if you take legacy wireless out. And that was, obviously, 3 years ago, 4 years ago, a very significant part of our revenue mix. Today, it's an insignificant part of the mix. So any impact that has on seasonality going forward, frankly, is -- what it did in the past is irrelevant to our future. So that's really the distinction that we're making at this point. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
I did. So just to look forward now, what should -- now that the legacy business will be gone when we go into next year, what should we be thinking about the normal seasonal patterns? And I'm sure you'll answer it, and we'll come back and ask you again for the 4 quarters.
Ron Slaymaker
What the -- the math I've done is, I think if you look at first quarter and you take legacy wireless out and you look at the last 3 years, it's flattish. But what I will encourage you to do, I think we have all of that data out on our website, and that would be a great project for you to work on tonight and publish in your note tomorrow. There'd probably be a lot of value added in that. So again, I'll just -- I'll refer you to that data and let you do the math.
Ambrish, thank you.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I'll stick with the theme of a couple callers ago and just stick to one question. There's been a lot of activity in the Analog segment lately relative to the sensors. There's been some M&A activity in some of the Analog peers this year that have grown -- in excess of the market have grown because they've gained some share or had some opportunities in the sensor market. How do you feel about TI's position in that market? Where do you see you guys going there?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't know that -- probably the one thing I would say, Jim, that in that sensing space and, obviously, there are lots of different types of sensors and they're different. But I think at some time in the last month anyway, a few weeks, we did an announcement really of a breakthrough product category in inductive sensing, which is, basically, an entirely new class of data converters, and that truly is innovative. That truly is breakthrough. That being said, when you look at the size of TI in our portfolio of 100,000 products, it can be a breakaway success and it's not going to have a big impact on TI in terms of moving the needle. But I think it's a great example of the kind of innovation that's been taking place at TI over the last decade and why you see just consistent share gains from our company. A lot of people talk about innovation and a lot of times, that spun up in technical terms. We really simplify it and measure it by our -- we producing and innovating and developing products that customers want. And we really let our market share tell the story. That provides the feedback of what is providing innovation that is valued by our customers. So that's one example, a little broader than your sensing question but absolutely a great space and we're right in the middle of it. Thanks, Jim.
Operator
We'll go to Glen Yeung with Citigroup.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Ron, when you look at the activity that you're -- cancellations are falling, I think you might not normally expect to see in the context of sum of orders. Are you seeing anything that's unusual, either one way or the other, from your customers?
Ron Slaymaker
No. Cancellations remain at what we would call very low levels by historical standards, and that's part of the reason why we really feel this is a -- we were coming up on a pretty seasonal fourth quarter. We're not seeing anything in the -- on the cancellation front, for example, that would indicate it's anything weaker than normal. I know a lot of people maybe were worried about, well, what's the effect of the government shutdown? Is that showing up in customer demand or anything like that? I'm not sure we have perfect visibly there but we sure didn't see backlog being pushed out by customers. We didn't see a higher rate of cancellations, which we think are both meaningful indicators. Do you have a follow-up, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes. As a follow-up, as I look at the reported gross margin, they're almost around 150 basis points more than what consensus is modeling for next year's gross margins. And I recognize that your movements in revenues and hence utilization will affect that. But as we think about the puts and takes, assuming that next year is even a modest growth year for SEMI conductors, as we think about the puts and takes on gross margins, what could the consensus see right, i.e. gross margins down 150 basis points from current levels, or is, perhaps, consensus seeing things wrong?
Kevin P. March
Yes, well, I guess I would just remind people as they're putting their models together of a couple things. As we look at what's going to drive our gross margins going forward, keep in mind, as we fill these very cost-effective factories that we acquired over the last couple of years, and especially as we fill them with a higher mix of industrial and automotive end market-type products, we're going to see margins continue to be pretty healthy. Another important point to keep in mind is that depreciation today is running about 400 basis points ahead of capital expenditures. So by definition, that means depreciation will start to work itself down over the next couple of years. And that, by itself, will be a boost gross margins. So those are probably the 3 things I would really point to, and that is, again, as we grow and fill up those factories; as we improve our portfolio mix, especially industrial and automotive; and as depreciation declines over the next few years on these lower levels of CapEx, those together should provide nice tailwinds to our gross margins as we go forward.
Ron Slaymaker
So to the scenario that Glen talked about, at 2014, as any kind of reasonable growth or any growth at all, given those tailwinds, it doesn't sound like the Street, if they're modeling down 150 basis points on gross margin, that does not sound consistent with what you just described. Is that right?
Kevin P. March
It sounds inconsistent, but also suggests that you're missing just exactly how much free cash flow we'll generate next year.
Ron Slaymaker
All right. Thank you, Kevin. Okay, and I think, operator, we're going to try to squeeze in one final caller and then we'll wrap it up.
Operator
Okay. Our final question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Kevin, you just talked about some of the puts and takes for gross margin for next year. From the $800 million roughly level you were for kind of core OpEx in the fourth quarter of this year x charges, restructuring, et cetera, what sort of OpEx puts and takes should we think of, heading into 2014?
Kevin P. March
Ross, I think the simplest thing I'd suggest to you is that, clearly, the people who are in R&D and SG&A, the OpEx buckets as we call it, are correctly anticipating that they'll see pay and benefit increases in 2014. So we would certainly see the effect of that. I would probably also remind you that in first quarter, our OpEx typically is seasonally up from fourth quarter. And that's a function of 2 things: one, it's the absence of the holiday periods that we see in the fourth quarter; and the second is the annual pay and benefit increases that begin to take effect in the first quarter and take full effect in the second quarter. So again, I would expect the spend rate as we go into next year begin to increase, coming off a low fourth quarter. Year-over-year, though, given the wind-down of the legacy wireless, probably still year-over-year attractive within our OpEx model in the 20% to 25% range -- probably 20% to 30% range of revenue, excuse me, being at the lower end of that range.
Ron Slaymaker
And Ross, just maybe even shorter term, fourth to first, OpEx typically goes up because of the pay and benefit increase that Kevin described that kicks in, in February but also, just fewer holiday and vacation days taken in first quarter compared with fourth. We see the benefit from those holidays and vacation days. But sequentially, then it tends to work against us in the first quarter. Okay, Ross. Thanks for your questions.
And in general, we're going to stop here. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

And that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for your participation.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' Third Quarter 2013 Mid-Quarter Update Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the third quarter of 2013. Dave Pahl from our Investor Relations team is also joining me today. In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company. In general, we will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segments or end markets, and we will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of this quarter, we will provide this information. As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening, considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter. And in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings around the middle of our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $3.15 billion and $3.29 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.51 and $0.55.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?

2013-09-10,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from James Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. Understanding that you are narrowing to the midpoint with this update, could you give us any color on what you're seeing in the various end markets in the quarter, and if any verticals are tracking incrementally better or worse than 6 weeks ago?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. What I would say is, as you might guess, with narrowing to the middle of the range, the quarter is generally tracking with our expectations. And I would say that's both at the company level as well as within various major product lines and end markets. We had expected -- and I think we explained this even back in the July call, that we expected that the first half growth that we had seen in the industrial and automotive markets would continue into the third quarter and in fact, it has. We also believed that the recovery in the communications infrastructure market that began in the second quarter would continue into the third quarter, and it has. Finally, we expected that some of the areas of weakness in the second quarter that were driven by customers that were reducing channel inventory in that quarter ahead of new product launches, we expected that demand would likely recover as those new product launches occurred. And I think in the July call, we specifically noted that this included customers in the handset market, as well as game consoles and notebook computers. And I would just note that all of these areas are growing again this quarter. Do you have a follow-on?
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
That's very helpful. As my follow-up, could you comment on linearity of order patterns quarter-to-date?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. It's not our usual practice to discuss linearity at this point in the quarter, so I'll stick with that practice here today. And any comments we had on linearity, we would make in the October call. Okay. Thank you for your questions.
Operator
We'll go next to Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Question on the comm infrastructure. Can you discuss whether it's primarily your DSP products or is it other product areas within your product portfolio that's seeing the benefits of comm infrastructure growth this quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Dave?
Dave Pahl
Yes, Stephen, if you look at our comm infrastructure, we shipped really a broad set of products. So we'll see the different businesses inside of Analog ship product into comm infrastructure. And if you look inside of Embedded Processing, we've got a line of processors that sit inside of that, as well as our custom ASIC. So the profile of those products, of course, will be dependent on the customer, but we are seeing a benefit to revenues across a wide range of product categories.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have follow-on, Stephen?
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Yes. In terms of your fab utilization rates, is the plan that you outlined at your last earnings call, is that tracking to plan or are there any changes at this time?
Dave Pahl
Yes, you bet, Stephen. We expect average utilization to be up slightly this quarter as we had expected.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you for your question, Stephen.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Ron, can you talk a little bit about book to bill and order trends throughout the quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I guess, Tim, what I would say on orders, in general, they've been solid this quarter. That was solid this quarter, and our backlog has continue to expand quarter-to-date. So therefore quarter-to-date, book to bill is greater than 1. That being said, I think as most of you have modeled, our fourth quarter revenue typically seasonally declines due to the post back-to-school drop in our calculator business. So based on that, we would expect that and it would be typical for the backlog gains to likely diminish somewhat as the quarter winds down. So exactly where we land, we'll have to report at the end of the quarter. But positive quarter-to-date, but likely to get smaller before the quarter ends because of that. Do you have a follow-on, Tim?
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Sure. And just so -- just to sort of go through what is normal seasonal for Q4, so semis are typically flat Q4. And then you subtract off about 300 basis points for the calculator business. Is that the right way to think about what a normal seasonal Q4 would be?
Ron Slaymaker
I think that's very consistent with our view. If I just go through the data, usually our calculator revenue declines by about $100 million sequentially, following the third quarter back-to-school period. So as you noted, that would then -- that $100 million would then negatively impact the company's growth by about 3 percentage points in the fourth quarter. So if I just look at historical averages, on a 5-year basis, the sequential growth for the fourth quarter is a negative 8%, but that also has a range of minus 26 to plus 4. And I'll also remind you that fourth quarter '08 really was an outlier period. So maybe it's more useful to just look at the last 4 years average where the decline is 4%, and that's largely explained by our calculator seasonality. So that's a long way of saying the same thing that you said to begin with, Tim. All right. Thank you for your questions.
Operator
And we'll go next to Glen Yeung with Citi.
C. Adeline Lee
It's Adeline calling in for Glen Yeung. Ron, can you talk a little bit about your visibility and it's sort of like where is the relative source of strength?
Ron Slaymaker
And I'm not -- Adeline, are you talking about when you say where is the relative source of strength, is that an end market question?
C. Adeline Lee
It's a question like where is your visibility strongest, in what end market, if you can think about it that way?
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, okay. I understand. I don't really have that breakout for you. So I know the overall order trends, but I don't have how much backlog in terms of time period by end market. So I can't really help you with that one. Do you have a follow-on, Adeline?
C. Adeline Lee
Sure. Relative to your comm infrastructure comments earlier, can you just sort of break it out between wired and wireless and also by geography and anything you are seeing different than 6 weeks ago?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I'll take that one, Adeline. I'd say that if you look at our comms infrastructure revenues for the company in the first half, that represented about 14% of our revenues overall. I don't have a detail underneath that between wireless and wireline. If I were to make a stab at it, I would say that the majority would be tilted towards the wireless part of the industry. And the wireline would include things like IP phones and video conferencing, media gateways as well as the traditional networking and telecom equipment. So -- and then by geography, from a wireless standpoint, I would just say that we're well positioned across all of the major OEMs that we service and that ship into that industry. So we'll benefit. We're seeing benefit, as an example this quarter, as China kind of looks like it's picking up. You heard us talk about last quarter that we benefited primarily in the U.S. as the U.S. carriers increased their spending.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you, Adeline.
Operator
We'll go next to Will Stein with SunTrust.
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
I'm hoping you can shed some light on the Embedded Processing segment, if you can talk about demand trends there, in particular, relative to your burgeoning microcontroller business.
Dave Pahl
Sure, Will. So Embedded Processing should grow sequentially, driven especially by strength in industrial and the automotive markets. And we're encouraged specifically because of the diversity of that growth, and we see that growth really from a wide range of product lines and end markets. So that's inclusive of microcontrollers, and we're starting to see some of the benefits of the investments that we had made there.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Will?
William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Yes. Actually related to the same segment, if you wouldn't mind commenting on margins, it would be very helpful. This is one segment that at an analyst day last year, you set a margin target. I believe it was 30% for the EP segment, and you were at a low point a couple quarters ago, it has recovered a bit in the last quarter. Any commentary either from a short- or long-term perspective in terms of your path to these much higher operating margins that you've talked about in that segment?
Dave Pahl
Yes, Will. I think if you look at the segment, look at where we've come from, a few things were pressuring the operating margins of that business. And the first was obviously as we look back a few quarters, we're operating in a very weak environment. And so that was pressuring the operating margins. And additionally as you heard us talk about before, we've stepped out and made some significant investments in microcontrollers, both in R&D, increasing the number of design teams that we've had in place, as well as field application resources. And what we're beginning to see now in the growth is a result of those investments and we're encouraged by it. So I think that we believe that even last quarter you saw significant increases in operating margin in that business. We believe that we'll continue to see that type of progress this quarter as we move forward. And that we're on a path to have that being a good contributor to TI at a company level.
Ron Slaymaker
Will, we appreciate your call.
Operator
We'll go next to Christopher Rolland with FBR.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
So I wanted to talk a little bit here, you said last quarter, notable expansion in gross margins. So given the EPS guidance, I still imagine that holds true. But perhaps you could quantify that a little bit more now that we're a little further through the quarter here.
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, there's no change to our view of the breakout. I think we gave you revenue. We've talked about operating expense. Our expectation is that it would be a down a couple of percentage points, and we continue to believe that. I think we identified that acquisition and restructuring/other will be right about $100 million, and we continue to expect that. So -- and I think somebody in the July call did some quick math and said they were coming up with about a 54% gross margin, which we affirmed was, in fact, the correct math. So again, no change to our views on any of that. Again, gross margin benefits as lower-margin wireless continues to decline, as higher-margin Analog and Embedded Processing products continue to grow. As we hold our capital expenditures stable at low levels of 4% or thereabouts, the depreciation which I think we said in July for the trailing 12-month period prior was more than 400 basis points above the capital expenditure level as a percentage of revenue. That will continue to decline in the years ahead. And so again, all of that points to not only a healthy gross margin this quarter, but plenty of runway as long as the economic environment and our industry conditions are conducive to growth. That being said, as we've told you plenty of times, the real benefit, the real consideration there is the free cash flow margin where we've set our objective of 20% to 25%. And I think we said in July the trailing 12-month period was 24% of revenue. That's really the margin objective on which management is focused in running the operations of the company. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
Sure. The -- I'm sorry if I missed it. The wireless wind-down, are your expectations still the same as they were at the end of the July call?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. No, you did not -- we haven't addressed that. So in fact, I think what we said in July was that we expect it to decline by about $90 million sequentially this quarter. And in fact, that continues to be our expectation. So what that means is that at the middle of our revenue range for this quarter, we would grow about 6% sequentially despite that decline in legacy wireless. So for the rest of our revenue, that would then result in growth of about 9%, again at the middle of our range. So as a reminder, legacy wireless revenue in the second quarter was $148 million, and we continue to expect that it will be essentially gone by the end of this year. So with that, that $90 million decline in the third quarter, in the third quarter, our legacy wireless revenue should be less than 2% of TI's overall revenue this quarter. Okay, Chris. Thanks for your questions.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Gabriel Ho
This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. You guys have appeared to turn around the Silicon Valley Analog sooner than the early expectation. Can you please help us understand what subsegments are driving that and how you're tracking this quarter with other Analog segments?
Dave Pahl
Hey, Gabriel. This is Dave. Maybe I'll address just the Analog overall and put the Silicon Valley inside of that context. And not because SVA is doing well, but so are all of the other Analog areas that we have. And we should see sequential growth from the Analog segment this quarter. But if you look at this quarter, we'll probably see strongest growth inside of our power products as it disproportionately benefits from product launches that Ron had mentioned earlier in handsets and gaming consoles, as well as just an overall recovery against a weak second compare inside of notebooks. If you look at an end market like automotive, that should be a driver in growth, specifically inside of HVAL as well as benefiting Embedded Processing. And then from an industrial market standpoint, that's going to continue to benefit Silicon Valley Analog as well as HPA.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on question, Gabriel?
Gabriel Ho
That's very helpful. As a follow-up, have you seen any expansion in the lead time at the channel? And what is your expectation on the channel inventory for the quarter?
Dave Pahl
Yes, lead times overall have not changed and remain short. So no changes on that front from our standpoint.
Ron Slaymaker
And keep in mind, even though it's not the only factor in lead times, we have plenty of open capacity. So we fully would expect to be able to maintain short lead times even as growth might continue going forward. So between the inventory that we have positioned and the capacity that we have available to us, our goal certainly is to keep lead times right in the same range where they are, where they are today. Okay. Thank you for your questions.
Operator
And we'll go next to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
It's Craig Hettenbach calling in for Joe. Ron, just following up on the strength in industrial automotive, which is above seasonal for Q3. Any color you can provide in terms of the trends you're seeing from an inventory perspective as well as resales?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I would make a -- I'll talk about the first part and then I'll let Dave talk about in general what we're seeing with distribution. I don't know that -- when you talk about inventory, different people have asked me about inventory at industrial customers. And I don't know how anybody directly observes inventory at industrial customers, because they tend to be lots and lots of small customers that purchase their products through distribution. We certainly are aware of what's going on with inventories at distribution. But in terms of their end customers, I would say generally, that's the role those customers play distributor -- pay distributors for is to carry inventory for them. But to the point they may be carrying some inventory on their own and is that inventory growing or depleting, frankly, we don't have that direct visibility. And I would seriously doubt any semiconductor suppliers do. Dave, do you have some comments on distribution, overall?
Dave Pahl
Yes. I would say that specifically to inventory, we don't expect days to change much inside of distribution. And that's in an environment where we expect revenues to increase about the same rate as our sales for the company overall.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Craig?
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Yes, just any color on just trends by geography. Particularly Europe, which seems to -- from the component perspective, ticked up a little bit, any color there?
Dave Pahl
Well, we pull the quarter-to-date trends. And so what we've seen so far is growth in Asia, in the U.S. and Japan. And we've actually seen Europe down slightly. And I'll just remind that's quarter-to-date. We'll see where we end up as we finish up the quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Craig, thank you for your questions.
Operator
We'll go next to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
This is Sameer Kalucha calling in for Chris Danely. Maybe you can provide some perspective on, from your vantage point right now, there's some macro headwinds or some things floating around, anything you see has the potential to maybe derail a seasonal outlook for Q4?
Ron Slaymaker
I'm not aware of any -- was that a statement that there are headwinds, or was there a question...
Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Some macro concerns hanging on maybe some geopolitical tensions.
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, yes, I have no idea how that would translate to semiconductor demand. And so we -- I don't have any real value to add in terms of any commentary there. Let me -- I think we talked about what fourth quarter typically is. The only real headwind is our calculator seasonality. And beyond that, we'll see. We'll have more comments probably in October. Do you have a follow-on question?
Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Follow-on is about the China build-outs. You mentioned it's tracking in line with expectations that you had earlier. But in terms of -- compared with last year, the confidence level is much higher, you would say? Whatever the carriers are saying they will spend, do you think they're on track to do that, or is there anything that can change it?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I think when you compare this year to last year, I think this is maybe the third year in a row that we were hoping to see follow-through from comms infrastructure standpoint and the difference in the confidences. We've actually seen it happen in third quarter. We may wait to make comments of what we think will happen in fourth quarter. But I'll point out that inside of our Embedded Processing, we are benefiting from comms infrastructure, and we certainly enjoy a very strong position there. I'll just also note, we are seeing a very broad basis of growth, including our microcontroller business as well as our connectivity business. So we're excited about that broadness and diversity of growth that we're seeing across a lot of different customers that's growing that business. So that's kind of what we're looking to as we look forward.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Sameer, thank you for your question.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Erik Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
I just wanted to chime in here. It's Erik calling in for Tore. Real quick, how have customer order patterns changed, given where we're at in the current stage of, I guess, the recovery, if you can comment on that?
Ron Slaymaker
So I don't know. Well, I mean, I think we talked about in second quarter we actually saw some extension, what I'll call extension in visibility, meaning customers did a onetime transition to give us additional visibility out in time. That is a -- that tends to be a onetime effect that we didn't expect necessarily to carry forward in the third quarter. So I think third quarter is generally tracking more with demand and demand expectations for the next quarter or so. But do you have follow-on, Erik?
Erik Rasmussen - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Sure. And I know you addressed it a couple of times, moving on to China, mobile and the comm infrastructure side, how do you see that? I know it's been very slow with the rollouts, obviously, the numbers that are out there, 200,000 TD-LTE base stations. But how you see that tracking for you guys? Is there a certain mechanism or a certain metric you guys are looking at for how it's going to impact your business?
Dave Pahl
Yes, I'll just add -- we've commented a couple of different ways on it but we are benefiting specifically from LTE deployments. I can say the majority of spend globally still remains on 3G. So we're enjoying that as well. But I think our position strengthens as we move into LTE, especially longer-term and even as you look into small cells and things that are happening there. So I think that both of those trends will favor us in the future.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, thank you. And I -- as we wrap up here, I'll note it was a good day in the market today. Obviously, the senior analysts took credit and went home early, left their associates working. Before we end the call, let me remind you that a replay is available on our website. Thank you and good evening.
Operator
Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc

Good morning, everybody. It is Day Two of Citi's Global Technology Conference for 2013. I am Glen Yeung. I am Citi's Global Head of Technology Research and the U.S. Semiconductor Analyst. We are very happy to have Texas Instruments here to speak to us.
On behalf of Texas Instruments is, Greg Delagi. Greg is specifically in the embedded part of the market, so we are going to focus primarily on that. I don’t know if I will be able to sneak a few questions or not. I won’t try.. But let's start out with Greg just giving us a little bit of commentary about the overall state of business.
Greg Delagi
Okay. Good. Glen, it's pleasure to be here. I appreciate to having the opportunity. I guess, if I just step back and think a little bit over the last five quarters that we formed this Embedded segment and so on so forth and there were a couple of big things.
Number one is, there were a lot of things we had to do in terms of reshaping our investments in the wireless space and really getting the portfolio tuned to this embedded opportunity that we see moving forward. I think, we made great progress with that.
I think, if you looked at the second quarter results you saw that the legacy wireless stuff is down to about 5% of the revenue with the company level. I think, we forecasted the 2 range for the third quarter, so you can see there's a lot of work, but that is largely behind us. All the focus and intensity is on the business moving forward.
Again, when we talk about embedded processing at TI, it really refers to three specific product areas. Microcontroller business, our Processor business and our Connectivity business, and as we go through, I may describe those in a little bit more detail.
I think if I step back and reflect five quarters into this deal where we are, I am pretty bullish and I feel really good about the progress we are making. First, I guess, I would start with growth. Then if you have looked at any of those, performance of the Embedded segment as a part of Texas Instruments, we've got growth. We grew in first quarter and we grew in second quarter. Not just the growth by itself is enough, but we got the businesses growing.
I think the commentary I would make on growth that make me feel good is, you go inside of those product areas and all three of the product areas are growing. Then if you look at what we call, what I would refer to as the primitive in terms of how we run the businesses, the product lines, there are individual product lines under each of those three areas.
If you look at those, there are 10 product lines in the Embedded Processing segment. If you look at those 10, we got all of them growing and we've got six of them that are growing in double-digit rate, so I look at that and say, I like the diversity. This isn't just single business that's driving this performance. It's relatively broad. We also look at our business in terms of more rich in terms of automotive as well as industrial.
We talk about those two segments or my business specifically being over 60% of our revenues in total, brings a lot of diversity, it brings a lot of stability, so we are growing. I feel good about the stability. I feel good about the diversity we've got in terms of the growth.
Number two, in terms of why I feel good, I would probably spend some time talking about, as we get the growth, we've also been trying to improve the financial performance…
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Right.
Greg Delagi
…of the segment. It's certainly the very important step forward in second quarter with the PFO for the segment approaching 9%, and getting operating profits, we think we will be able to continue to expand on this as we go through the year, so we are really starting to point this place in the direction to get it much more in sync with the current expectations that you guys have for us at the company level.
The last area I would talk about is, just if you look at the new products. Again, I look at R&D spending and we have made a pretty significant ratchet up in terms of our R&D spending a couple of years ago with things like accelerating our position in microcontrollers as you watched us do that.
Inside of that spend looking at where we are spending it on which markets and the class of products we are building across processor and microcontroller and connectivity. I am incredibly excited about what those investments should yield for us in the years to come, so those are kind of the pieces why I feel good about the momentum in general.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Yes. Let me ask you a question, because I had a discussion with you once again before, where we talked about your view that, for TI as a corporation, one of the success factors that's been a big sales force. That sales force for a long time led with an analog sale. Then we formed this Embedded division.
Do you feel like the sort of cross-selling or probably you get an attach rate of an analog to an embedded product is at an appropriate level at this point, now how much rooms we have left to get that sales force to change maybe leading with embedded sometimes?
Greg Delagi
I think the synergy that we have, the opportunity we have got between Analog and Embedded at company levels is, there really is, it's really a symbiotic relationship. The analog position that we have in the breadth of that portfolio gives us tremendously broad exposure to the customers in the marketplace. We talk about 100,000 customers in analog.
Every electronic device that's manufactured uses some kind of an analog component. We got 100,000 relationships with customers today. If I take that 100,000 and I break it down into how many of those customers are using some kind of an embedded processor, a microcontroller or processor, et cetera, you are probably in the range of 60,000 or 65,000 of those customers that are using some host processor.
Our broadest customer base in Embedded Processing is our Microcontroller business at probably 30,000 customers, so that has by definition the reach and the exposure we get in analog leads me to another 30,000 customers that we already have the relationship with.
Next time if those sockets come up on the processor side, or on the Embedded processor side, we have got an opportunity to participate, so that's one dimension. The other dimension is that, when we went with an embedded processor, whether I am talking about an automotive infotainment application or a communication infrastructure, or any of the products in the products in the broad category of industrial and things that we are doing are the sales forces' ability to go up and pull through the rest of the signal chain is extraordinary and the company spend a lot of time with the sales force focusing on the customers who are calling on, having a project oriented mentality and really looking at how many sockets per board can we get which really is tough to talk about getting that leverage from that scale that we have got in terms of the sales force across our total portfolio of analog embedded processor.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
How often is it the case that Embedded is the first when you are calling analog, versus analog is the [first] calling embedded?
Greg Delagi
I don't know what kind of rate I would put on that. I think, pretty much every customer we could call on, you've got an opportunity with analog. I think with the breadth of our portfolio, you have got something to sell.
On the Embedded side, there are clearly place where, again, two-thirds of those customers are using a host proxy that had the conversation. You may have to wait for that design cycle to reappear and in the meantime we have an opportunity to penetrate from the analog side. I don't know what ratio I would put on that though.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
It sounds to me that the ability to attach Embedded to analog is partially what helps grow Embedded, right?
Greg Delagi
Yes. I think so. I wouldn't say attach. I think, attach is a little bit strong, because you don't go in and sell a signal chain device and then pull through a processor. What will tend to happen is, we will get visibility into that customer what they are building. Through that knowledge, we can then be in position where we could try to craft the value proposition how we can help the customer to solve a problem from an embedded processor standpoint.
The converse though is, when we do in the embedded processor socket typically tends to be the first chip in the system that's designed and so that you can pull through a lot of the content. The only place in analog we really have that dimensioning component that the device is picked and then the rest of the signal chain is designed with these data converters, so it's kind of the Embedded Processing and data converters that give you that early visibility into the customers.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Okay. Sort of just almost I think at the level when we think about the profitability, yes, you made progress in the last quarter in terms of profitability, but what's lapped and where is the target in Embedded and how you get there ultimately?
Greg Delagi
I think it's pretty simple. I mean, the top line growth is something that has been very, very important. We stepped up our investments. You watched that microcontroller.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Yes.
Greg Delagi
Now, it's turning that into revenue. Turning that into revenue and turning in the margin, so I think having the breadth of engines or the number of cylinders and the engine that we are trying to build now gives me confidence about the fact that we are going to have a much more sustainable machine.
I think, if I look at new design and the momentum we are building in the product areas are very encouraging that then the next wave of products that are coming. Part of the operating process transition that we have been through is we had stepped up that investment. I mean, number one, we have been in a little bit of a weak market.
Number two, there has been some mix or maybe we were overly dependent on a single segment of the business. Something like Communication Infrastructure for too much of a financial contribution and so we needed more diversity there. Then lastly, just talk about we had scaled up our investments because of the opportunity with radar that stuff is coming into balance now as the businesses grow and the margins improve, we should chill the operating leverage and that's what we are working on.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
If you sort of then, you have made the investment, you are sort of balancing out by end market a little bit. Where you see the greatest growth opportunities in Embedded, and recognize that it's bit of a nebular terms if you...
Greg Delagi
Yes. Let's talk about on a business-by-business if you look inside of the microcontroller space, a place where we've dramatically stepped up the investment in the last couple of years. Investments in new products and also investments in terms of field and resources, the field application engineers close to the customers to support the design-in from the customers, the customer design process.
The business is growing. It's been growing consistently and we feel, we are gaining share, clearly gaining share. In fact, if you look at our microcontroller, I don't we have broken it out in percentage terms, but we look at our performance versus free scale, we look at it versus ST, we look at it versus Renesas, we look at it versus Microchip, and if you rack up those guys and contrast with our performance, we feel very clear that we have gained significant share this year and we will continue to do so with the wave of new products that are coming.
Our Microcontroller business, we are coming from a smaller position in that market. We got a lot of work to do to go up and expand. It's a huge opportunity. We've got a combination of both, proprietary architectures with our C2000 and MSP430, and we have augmented that with investments in ARM based microcontrollers, so that's been a great part of the expansion. You see us doing very differentiated things in terms of low power, analog integration of both flash and a DRAM, again, I feel very, very good about the fact that we are competing in a landscape, where our products are getting stronger than some of our competitors someone like Renesas, probably weaker than they were historically, and at the TI scale from the sales force standpoint, I think it's a winning combination.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
It does seem that perhaps this is probably is somewhat obvious source of from whom you are gaining share. If you were to think about it from an end market perspective in what end markets or what applications you have been taking the share?
Greg Delagi
Yes. I mean, you see, I think that's a general term. It's not an end market, but I think low power franchise that we built with the MSP430 and how we are extending that today. You find microcontrollers getting designed in increasing number of devices. All those devices tend to care about power, whether you are talking about the variable trends, whether you talk about things like blood glucose meters, there is a whole host of applications that care about power.
The other big area I would talk about is in the control space and it's tough to talk about things like motor control, where you are really trying to get into a close loop control systems, where microcontrollers can bring a significant benefit. That is a business that has done very, very well for us and that we have been investing.
Again, the leadership position in terms of analog integration, what you are doing with the system even more important than what is the microcontroller core in those solutions. How we are solving that control system in terms in terms of what you are integrating from an analog and accelerator and other system components inside of that system. Then you have got a broad swath of. Then you've got automotive which is obviously a target-rich environment. Then you have got a broad swath of just what we general refer to as catalog, lots and lots of different customers building a very, very broad variety of things.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Can I turn your attention just for a second to this variable idea? I know it's a nascent business. From what you do can see now what's happening, what's just your general opinion about that? Do you think this is going to do real business?
Greg Delagi
I think, I mean in general I may define variables differently than you do. I guess, what I would, let me transition to the connectivity piece of the business, because I think it's important. When I look at the fact that increasingly more and more devices are wanting to get connected, I would refer to them as some of them are going to get connected to via Bluetooth or Bluetooth low energy, so I want to use my smartphone as the hub. Things like my fit that I have on today and other devices watches and so on and so forth, those are all demanding very low power microcontroller architectures as they are all demanding the connectivity solution with Bluetooth as the primary connection vehicle. I think that that is an area that is exploding based on the things that we are seeing. It can be weight scale, it can be personal devices that I wear. It can be watches. There are a whole host of things that want to get connected and will use my cell phone as a hub to be connected. That's Bluetooth low energy. That's really that's the core of what we are doing from a connectivity standpoint.
The second area is, when you think about things like Wi-Fi, and now how do I use Wi-Fi as a vehicle to connect my device the different way and I have and I have been called [for this], but I actually counted the number of devices I had at home that are connected on the wireless LAN network and I have 39 devices hanging off my wireless network at home, so I maybe a geek, but if you run through and count them I have got five children, so I get a little bit of a less lift off of that, but you count up the smartphones, you count up the tablets, you count up the laptops. I have got a pool controller, I have got a dozen light switches that I can turn them on and off remotely. I got thermostats that operate with wireless LAN connection. I can control anything in my home to my smartphone or tablet now that I have already got this installed network and I can just hang additional device stuff at. That whole area is exploding, so that gives me the capability not to be within 10 meters of the device like a Bluetooth connection. It gives me the capability to be anywhere on the planet and control something. That's the role Wi-Fi plays.
Then you would also talk about things like ZigBee, which are matched networks and much more complicated and you've also got some of the sub stuff, so this everything connected thing is absolutely explosive and why we have kept the connectivity investments that we had shifted then from smartphones specifically into these markets and I think we have got an unparallel position with the products that we have combined with our sales force and our ability to reach this broad set of customers when I think about who we typically competed within those spaces. In like smartphone, it's very, very difficult for others to compete with us there.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Now, in smartphones, with respect to Wi-Fi, you recently licensed Wi-Fi to a smartphone company. I know it's hard to get a color too, but I might as well ask. No?
Greg Delagi
You can ask.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
…but is that a trend? Is it? Do you think why licensing is a trend that TI can TI can deploy to other areas?
Greg Delagi
Yes. I would tell you that I have no desire to be in a licensing business and the business model and put a machine go up that says we are going to do it. I think this was a perfect example of an ability to monetize an asset that we have. We have very cutting edge technology. Obviously as evidenced by $315 million purchase and that was a transparent asset as I think the actual words we use and that was because it was licensed with some transfer of databases and other materials, but the thing that was good about this is that we basically did that and it was being used by an end customer, not a competitor and it has no restrictions associated with it, so we are free to operate with no encumbrances and we are continuing to focus 100% our effort on our connectivity vision for everything getting connected.
We monetized an asset that we had in the wireless context and didn't create a competitor, so it was a no brainer for us to do. Is there someone else that will knock on our door and want to do that? I am more than open to the conversation, but licensing as a business model that's not what I am trying. As it comes to us, if there are opportunities, if there's a $20 bill on the ground, we will usually stop to think about.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Okay, so let me think about the idea that in that segment of market to be clear, which you guys don't ultimately aggressively participate in. there's a platform of ours that's forming, right? You need to have Wi-Fi connectivity along with (Inaudible), but that concept of that platform approach in smartphone, does that stay in concert as far as some of the changes seeing in embedded and it's an advantage for you to need to go and acquire things to build [platform].
Greg Delagi
Yes. The platform stuff does apply when we start to talk about the internet of things and how to go up and address that market. It's a different kind of definition of the platform. The first thing you need to do is on the connectivity technologies, I believe that there are things yet to do. Number one is, you got to make this stuff easy to use, because you are not dealing like we did in the smartphone context, where [customer] and exit the RF engineers.
I may be work with a guy designing a thermostat who can't spell RF, so I have got to make this stuff very easy to use. I have got to be able to package it up so that we eliminate the complexity for people that have wireless system.
The second thing is you got to continue to drive these continuities in terms of power. Every time we cut the power by half, you will find new applications and my variable will last for a month or a week, I can take cost out of the system, because I can use smaller batteries, whatever. It's fundamental, huge opportunity, but that's what you are going to focus on.
The combining piece of that from a standpoint is the MCU, right? If you look at what's happening in the industry now, you watch and Microchip within SMSC, watch Silicon Labs, with Energy Micro, everybody who wants to take part in this internet of things is scrambling the to try to bring together the capabilities of the microcontroller and the wireless technologies and build that portfolio, because it's not just enough. We got to have the two of those pieces and so you look at the time and attention we are paying to both of those businesses and the similarities between them and what we can be doing mark those products together, I think we are in a very good position to take advantage of...
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
How important is process technology to sort of moving that technology forward?
Greg Delagi
I would tell you, I think process technologies are very important, but it's a little bit counterintuitive. If you look at them, I use this example from a connectivity standpoint, when we were in the smartphone space, we had pushed ahead with some generations that product down to the 45-nanometer node and it's an industry leading things in terms of collapsing RF functions like PAs on chip and five radios on a single chip.
As we go into some of these spaces that care more about power than they do maybe on integration, which are actually defined as sort of 65-nanometer or 90-nanometer, because of what you can do to tune those processes, specifically for analog integration or specifically for ultra low power, we actually get a better, more definitive solution by backing up a node in terms of what you can achieve from low power analog integration in both, in microcontroller and connectivity that's really the sweet spot of I got to low power. I have got to be able to integrate analog, so then process certainly as we get into we tweak things inside the TI from a process standpoint to be able to enable some of that.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Okay. Let me shift the discussion to an area that was specific and specificity to be fair, but the idea of wireless infrastructure, which is I guess in the processor part of your business. One, just describe what is TI's embedded businesses position in the wireless infrastructure?
Greg Delagi
Okay. Just before I talk about that inside of our processor group there are really two vertical markets that we are pursuing. One is our communication infrastructure investment that I think you are familiar with them and I will talk about in a minute.
The second area, and when I say vertical , what I really mean that we are tuning SOC system on a chip implementation specifically for those kinds of applications. The second area would be automotive. When we talk about infotainment and advanced safety specifically, we got solutions chip level processor solutions that are tuned specifically for those applications. Those are then complimented in our processor group with what we do generically and DSP single and multi-core, even ARM based processor products that we have like our (Inaudible), so that's really the composition of our processor business and I think the combination of those four is a pretty strong position.
Back to your question on communication infrastructure, it's a good business for us. It has been a good business for us for a long time, one that we have been investing for over a decade. There are changes happening inside of that market and as the role of macro growth, macro base stations are more plateauing from a growth standpoint. There is probably strength then that we are seeing and the market close today in terms of the communication infrastructure market, but probably the biggest variable that we've got in terms of where things go is the role small cells will play into qualities of the networks.
We believe that we are very well positioned in both, macro and small cell and uniquely positioned in terms of being able to provide that platform that allows the common software across macro and small cell, which is integral to what the operators want to do in terms of quality of service.
If you look at our design-in base on small cell, you look at our position in macro, it's a great business for us. My key point is, it's a great business for us. We are continuing to invest in it. I think we have got a very good outlook in that business, but it's not the only business when you talk about diversity of what we are doing in embedded processors.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Now, let's talk about the other part of that which is automotive, I just want to bring up point that came up in a car you had earlier actually with Freescale, and we are talking about barriers to entry to other chipmakers trying to get into automotive, which really sounds like everyone is trying to get into automotive at this point. It's the great market to be in.
One of the things that they said was, you do development work and you want to [take] all five, six, seven and there is a financial barrier. If you are a small company with not a lot of cash, you kept virtually doing developments for seven years, so, one, do you agree with that? Then two, where is the opportunity more broadly for your business in automotive.
I guess, we like the automotive market. We've been in it for 25 years. It is a very interesting market because of the use of electronics in cars. I will also take a little bit of the shine of it in terms of it an unbelievably hard market. If you look at the magnitude of the long-term reliability, how we have to service any line fallout, the structure and responsibility to serve that customer base, we got a bunch of people showing up saying they want to be in the automotive business. I would maintain that they don't have a clue.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Correct.
Greg Delagi
What it takes.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Right.
Greg Delagi
Even passed the product development cycle about the cost and infrastructure has to be built to meet the expectations of that market, so it's a tough market big aggressive customers, huge reliability concerns, et cetera, et cetera and that's we are very experienced and that we are going up and we are trying to build from.
To me, there are barriers of entry is, you start to look at a couple of spaces that we are focused on in a very material way and there are a lot of things we do in some of the standard product areas, but the two biggest areas of focus on processor are on the infotainment socket, so you think about that center of console and what that console does and trying to make that be a much more most of user experience.
The second area is in ADS, which is advanced driver safety. Think about lane change, lane departure adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, all of these kinds of systems and both of those offer tremendous opportunities. The chips have to be customized for those opportunities. You have got to make a commitment and investment to do chips specifically for that market, you got to meet the long-term reliability, you got to deliver a roadmap, because increasingly the customers are writing more and more software on top of these platforms and they have got to support these products in the marketplace more even longer than the model year.
These companies have got to be able to support a car sold in 65 countries around the world for the next 10 years in terms of software upgrades or so on and so forth, so there's a ton of complexity there, but a huge opportunity and significant of software that is written on those platforms.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Is there any risk that things like infotainment get commoditized in a car or I have an aftermarket radio in my car that's actually android, right? I mean, basically it's a cell phone that's embedded into my car and other companies have used [frankly], right? Could that become a wave or is there more to it? I mean, the sensors you need to ultimately feeling that…
Greg Delagi
I think there are two dimensions I would talk about. First one is, there is no guarantee. Every market goes two phases, so standing over there and say it will network commoditizer that's something that we should never be thinking about. I think, we would be irresponsible, number one.
Number two, I think the balancing point is that today and I believe for the foreseeable future, the automotive manufactures still feel very, very passionate about user experience. Then when I get into my BMW that is going to have a look and a feel. When I get into my Mercedes, it's going to have a look and feel, when I get into my Ford, my GM, whatever those, they want to own and control that user experience and they have to own a control that platform over the long-term. That all adds up to the fact that there is significant investment that's happening on top of those platforms, so then to build that user experience and then for them to differentiate. As long as those components are there, I think it can be alive and healthy and there's great opportunity.
The second that starts to shift to where those investments aren't made, then I think the opportunity looks different. I also think the dynamics of what's happening inside of the car, it's not a static function. What is happening in my center Stack Infotainment System, how it integrates with the cluster, how it's going to integrate with the heads up control, how is it going to integrate with the safety features, because you can have this big fancy infotainment system, but now I want to integrate with the sensors. I have gone out there from safety standpoint, so do I display speed limit signs, do I display other warnings and the intricacy of those systems to me are a barrier that says that there are probably some things there that should keep it a very, very positive opportunity for a longer term.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Yes. Frankly, I mean, most infotainment systems, they are pretty bad, so you are trying to imagine that there's not much low-hanging fruit.
Greg Delagi
Integration with the safety stuff is a megatrend, because it's not just that you've got all the stuff, all the tad capability and stuff that's got to be offered to you from a safety standpoint either to your heads up display or on your dash and all the auto manufacturers and I spend a ton of my time out in the marketplace dealing with these customers and talking to them about the long-term, which is very interesting to see the conversations about the between the cluster, the heads up display, the infotainment and ADS, all the different policies that are getting leveraged, complicated metrics of things that are going on.
For our position, we've got a great business, we've got an expanding business. I like our win ratio now. It will take time for the revenue to come. I think one of the biggest assets we have is, when you pick any major automotive manufacturer any major Tier-1, we are in the conversation with our customer about where this technology is going to evolve to over the next five years, so if another competitor shows up and say I am interested in automotive, they are not in that conference room, they are not in the current system, they are not defining what their roadmap needs to look like over the next five years. That doesn't guarantee us success, but it certainly gives us position of relationship and insight that I think we can leverage.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Right. Let me see if there's any questions from the audience. Anybody have any questions at this point? One over here.

Within your embedded business, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the wireless infrastructure market? Specifically, by the three goes, U.S. Europe and Asia, particularly China?
Greg Delagi
Yes. I think, we are and I think we said some of this when we talked about our second quarter results and we've got a mid-quarter next week, so Dave has promised me that I wouldn't steal any thunder from that or he would kill me I think is what he said.
I think the way I would categorize, if you look at wireless infrastructure over time, we again had a very strong position and it's been up and down in terms of what's happening in the market in terms of capital spending and deployments and so on and so forth.
We have seen strength in the U.S., we've seen you read the same papers as I do. You see what's happening in terms of China deployment. I would characterize that as a strengthening environment. It was positive for us in the second quarter and I would say look at the back half of the year as a strengthening environment is the guidance that I would provide.
What it looks like in terms of 2014, it's anyone's guess. I think the segment in total will continue to, there will be some volatility as capital dollars are spent and deployments happened. We think secularly, it's still a great marketplace and there is continued expansion in terms of the opportunity, again, macro plus small cells. Over the long-term, we think it's a great market, but there are going to be some ebbs and flows depending on CapEx expenditures by the operators and so on and so forth and how that ripples through to the regions, but today my comment would be take one away, I think we would say that it's a strengthening environment today.
Unidentified Analyst
(Inaudible) 
Greg Delagi
Well, I am not familiar with the specific comment that may have been a macro TI comment. I don't think that is a comment that would hold through on the embedded portion of what we are seeing in automotive today. Again, when I think about how I spend my time, where I was last week, dealing with customers, winning new designs. There's a long lead time between winning those designs and having those go into production. I feel very good about what we are winning today and what that means for the future.
I think, if you look at attach rates and dollar content for ADS systems and infotainment, there is still a dramatic opportunity in front of us in terms of the semiconductor content in those systems for the next 10 years. I think, it is a dramatically expanded opportunity from where we are today.

Yes. I think it's part of the opportunity is trickle down, part of the opportunity is that a lot of the stuff is options, and so you got to look at option, take rates and what are penetration rates. I'll take it from a personal standpoint back to my five children analogy, when I buy a car now for my kids, it's got more safety features in it so that they, I didn't have the eight, small accidents that have happened, because they haven't been paying attention and probably my bias would be to spend the money on some of those options in the next cars that I buy, because I think the capability is absolutely compelling.

We have time for one more question if anybody has one.
Unidentified Analyst

I don't remember if the ARM 64-bit processor business falls under embedded at TI, but if it does, can you talk about your design wins, the pipeline and how do you differentiate KeyStone versus some of the other ARM processors that are out there?
Greg Delagi
If you look at our ARM investments and you said 64-bit, but you just look at generically what we are investing in from an ARM technology. We haven't made any announcements on 64-bit or anything else, but in the A15, A8, A9, A15 class devices inside of the KeyStone architecture. That platform and the platform where it is very, very important, what we are doing with those products is a combination of general purpose capability which is ARM in this context along with other element by particular problem, so in our hawking device which we have announced actually has four A15s and 8 DSPs, eight of our C6000 DSPs.
That chip is actually at the core of the HP Moonshot, so what you see there is it's not just an offering of ARM versus an x86 class architecture. It's the benefits of what I can do with the other integration with some of that capability to kind of transform the power for performance power points that we can hit by leveraging the DSP technology as well, so there are all system on a chip class implementations that we are doing. ARM is an ingredient of that technology, but it's balanced with other factors.
I am very bullish on that business in total. I will get our power per watt, power per dollar, performance per dollar numbers that we can hit with those class of products and you put them up against x86s, you put them up against power PCs, you put them up against FPGAs for those who still want to do their own architectures, I think we are incredibly competitively positioned to have that being expanding part of our business as we move forward, but again it's not necessarily attacking market that exist. There may be markets that are being served with other technologies.
A6, FPGAs, for those who still want to do their own architecture. power PCs, x86, that's our product line in total is an opportunity for us to expand dramatically into the embedded space.

I think it remains to be seen in terms of exactly how big an opportunity that is. What I will tell you is that we are not playing. It's just is an ARM consolidator where anybody can do it with an ARM license and a founder relationship. We are bringing a higher level of solving a system level issue where people are going to invest to try to take advantage of what the architectures could do.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for September 10. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.
The second quarter was another solid quarter for TI. Revenue came in as we expected, up 6% sequentially and up 8% if you exclude legacy wireless revenue, which declined to less than 5% of TI revenue in the quarter. Analog and Embedded Processing increased to 78% of TI revenue. Our overall backlog continued to increase, visibility into the second quarter has improved and we expect another quarter of solid growth in the third quarter.
The industrial and automotive markets were once again important drivers of TI revenue growth. More than 35% of our product revenue in the first half of 2013 came from these important markets. Although we continue to have exposure to the PC and handset markets, these are now much smaller percentages of our revenue. We believe this increased diversity of markets and customers should make for steadier growth and financial returns.
The strength of our business model continues to give us confidence that we can sustainably generate $0.20 to $0.25 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue and then return all of it to shareholders except what is required to repay debt. As we said previously, free cash flow is an important consideration for a couple of reasons. First, net income has generally lagged the amount of free cash flow that we have generated for the past few years and will continue to lag in the years ahead. This is because of the significant noncash items on the income statement, including amortization of acquisition intangibles, as well as the large amount by which depreciation exceeds our capital expenditures. The second reason free cash flow is important is that cash returns are a big part of our long-term shareholders' returns. The more free cash flow we generate, the more we return in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. For the trailing 12-month period, free cash flow was 24% of revenue, 1 point higher than last quarter. And once again, we returned all of that and more to our shareholders, consistent with our capital management strategy. Earnings in the second quarter were strong, a result of good operational execution and improving product mix and a transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer, reflecting our continued monetization of the legacy wireless business even as this product revenue declines.
Let me walk through a few details of revenue. Analog revenue grew 6% sequentially. Silicon Valley Analog, High-Volume Analog and logic and High-Performance Analog all contributed to the sequential growth. Power was about even as growth in broader markets was offset by weaker demand at certain handset customers and game console manufacturers, which were preparing for a product transition. SVA, with its strong participation in the industrial and automotive markets, has been the leading driver of growth within our Analog business. Additionally, it has outgrown the Analog market over the past 3 quarters. From a market share perspective, SVA troughed in the second half of 2012, and its share has significantly rebounded as it has grown since then. As we have communicated to you previously, our original expectation for SVA was that it would continue to lose share in the first year after the acquisition, grow similar to the market in this second year and then gain share in the upcoming third year. We're running a full year ahead of this plan.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% sequentially, with processors up the most, followed by growth in microcontrollers and connectivity. Although connectivity was the smallest contributor, its growth rate was the highest as a range of customers embraced our low-power products. In processors, communications infrastructure had solid growth, reflecting increased operator spending, especially in North America.
In our other segments, sequential growth in most product areas was largely offset by the decline in legacy wireless. Legacy wireless revenue fell by $62 million sequentially to $148 million. Calculators grew as retailers prepared for back-to-school demand. DLP grew, driven by demand for high-resolution front projectors, and custom ASIC revenue was about even. Royalties declined.
Turning to distribution. Resales grew 5% sequentially. Distributors' inventory levels held about even on a dollar basis and declined by about 1 day.
Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Our earnings in the quarter included a gain of $315 million associated with a transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer. This gain was recorded on the restructuring charges line of our income statement and in our other segment. The gain was partially offset by related expenses. The net gain was not included in the guidance we provided to you previously. In addition, restructuring charges were higher than originally expected. The net impact of these items was a $0.16 benefit to earnings per share in the quarter.
Gross profit was $1.57 billion, up 14% sequentially. Gross margin was 51.5% of revenue and expanded 390 basis points sequentially. This strong profit fall-through was a result of our increasing leverage of the low-cost capacity we have in place and our improving product mix as lower-margin legacy wireless revenue continued to wind down and higher-margin Analog and Embedded Processing revenue grew.
Operating expenses of $860 million were reduced by $18 million sequentially. Operating profit was $906 million or 29.7% of revenue. Net income in the second quarter was $660 million, or $0.58 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $674 million in the quarter. I should note that the gain on the technology transfer did not impact cash flow as payment was not due in the quarter. You can see this impact on the prepaid expenses and other returned assets line of the cash flow statement. We increased our inventory by $20 million compared with the prior quarter. Inventory days increased to 105 days, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $577 million. Although cash flow from operations was about the same as the year ago, our free cash flow was higher as our capital spending needs are lower. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.32 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $427 million, down 28% from a year ago. As a result, free cash flow was $2.90 billion, up 10% from a year ago.
Free cash flow was 24% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period, within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue. In the year-ago trailing 12-month period, free cash flow was 20% of revenue.
Capital expenditures for the past 12 months were about 3% of revenue. Our low capital spending level is a direct result of the strong capacity position that we have built with our strategic investments of the past few years. The cash flow that will result as we continue to fill up this capacity should be strong in the years ahead.
I'll note that depreciation expense for the past 12 months exceeded our capital expenditures by $495 million. As a percent of revenue, depreciation was more than 400 basis points higher than our capital expenditures. This is one of the reasons why our free cash flow has been trending higher than our net income. Of course, depreciation will decline to the rate of capital spending over the next few years, benefiting gross margin as it does. Another major reason why free cash flow has trended higher than net income is the amortization expense of $80 million to $85 million per quarter that will remain on our income statement for another 6 years. In the trailing 12 months, amortization expense was $341 million or about 3% of revenue.
And as we said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide strong cash returns to our shareholders. In the second quarter, TI paid $309 million in dividends and repurchased $721 million of our stock. Our capital management strategy is it to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders except for what we need to repay debt. In the second quarter, we reduced our debt level by $500 million. We also benefit from proceeds from employee stock option exercises that have allowed us to return more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders while maintaining our targeted level of cash.
For the past 12 months, we have paid $971 million in dividends or 34% of our free cash flow. Similarly, we have repurchased $2.6 billion of our stock or 90% of our free cash flow. In total, we returned 123% of free cash flow in the past 12 months.
Fundamental to our cash returns strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the second quarter with $3.24 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 82% of that amount owned by TI's U.S. entities. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders grew 6% sequentially, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.03 as our backlog expanded again this quarter.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.09 billion to $3.35 billion in the third quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would increase about 6% sequentially despite our assumption that revenue from our legacy wireless products would decline by about $90 million in the quarter. For the rest of our revenue, that would result in growth of about 9% of the middle of our range.
This quarter, I'll provide some additional detail to our outlook than what we typically provide. This is in consideration of the unusual items in our second quarter and to help baseline your models. We expect operating expense in the third quarter to decline a couple of percent compared with the second quarter. The combination of our acquisition charges line and our restructuring charges line should be about $100 million in the quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.57.
In the third quarter, investors will see for the first time the Analog and Embedded Processing company that we've been building over the past years without the distraction of the Wireless business we've been unwinding. Legacy wireless revenue should be less than 2% of total TI revenue in the third quarter. Even with depreciation levels continuing well above our capital spending, we expect gross margin to, again, move up notably in the quarter and we expect to produce ongoing strong free cash flow in the years ahead that results from this business model.
For the year, our estimate for R&D expense is unchanged at $1.5 billion. Our estimate for capital expenditures remains $500 million, well below our depreciation estimate of $900 million. Our estimated effective tax rate is revised up to 24% from our prior estimate of 22% as a result of our higher 2013 profit forecast.
In summary, we are seeing our company develop into what we've planned. Our business, focused on Analog and Embedded Processing, is highly diverse across customers and markets. Therefore, we believe TI can deliver more stable growth in the years ahead with the business model that delivers good profitability and low capital intensity. As a result, free cash flow should continue to be strong, $0.20 to $0.25 for every dollar of revenue. This will allow us to provide a rare combination of growth and high cash returns to our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
"
2013-07-22,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] At this time, we'll take a question from Glen Yeung.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Kevin, can you walk us through the gross margin expectations for the third quarter? Just what are the puts and takes on how you get to what I think you called notable gross margin improvement in that quarter?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Glen, I think what you're going to see with legacy wireless declining by about $90 million next quarter, that lower-margin revenue is going to be displaced by higher-margin revenue with the form of Analog and Embedded Processing to get the bigger piece. In addition, with our growing backlog and a higher revenue expectations for the quarter, we'll be utilizing more of our factory capacity. So as you kind of run through all that, I talked a moment ago about our operating expenditures, we'd expect to be down a couple of percent over -- quarter-over-quarter and restructuring and acquisition costs to be about $100 million in the quarter. So you squeeze that math on through and you'll see that our gross profit margin will continue to increase, as it has this last quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I do have a follow-on. If I look at your -- and forgive me if I'm doing this math wrong, but I think I got it right. If I look at your revenues less Wireless year-on-year in the June quarter, it was still actually a negative number. And I think based on your guidance, it will be positive in the third quarter. Question is do you think that your revenues, less Wireless, will actually be positive for the year?
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, Glen. I don't -- I'll let you try to extrapolate what we've done year-to-date out and into the fourth quarter. Clearly, with the legacy wireless down as significantly as it will be in the third quarter, and we've said before that we expect it to be pretty much 0 by the time we get into 2014, that variable was pretty much filled in for fourth quarter. But you can make some estimates on what the rest of the revenue could look like to make the assessment of whether we're going to be up overall without legacy wireless.
Operator
We'll take a question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Hey, Ron. First, if I could just add, the improvement that we're seeing across the industry in the comms business early stages, can you offer some perspective on that and how long do you think that could potentially last? What the puts and takes there would be?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, and I think you're talking specifically about infrastructure there, so at least that's what my comments will be. I -- we've actually seen pretty broad growth across geographies. It is being led by North America and it's being led by some of the players that late last year, in terms of operators, announced that they would be doing capital spending increases this year. So after several quarters of what I'll say is not a lot of activity, we did see real results in third quarter. But again, it was broader than North America. Looking into the back half of the year, I think we're still optimistic that -- well, actually, first of all, let me say that what we're seeing in North America is a combination of continued WCDMA deployment but also accelerating LTE deployments as well. So again, as you know, we play quite strongly across both the new LTE technology as well as the more entrenched WCDMA, so we're seeing strength on the combination. In terms of China, we, like many other people, are waiting to see the impact of -- and whether in fact we'll see second half deployments. But clearly, that's our expectation. We've seen some activity more so from the standpoint of customers getting prepped for that in Japan. But we haven't actually seen the bear [ph] left, and I think that's pretty much consistent with at least my understanding of what other players have been describing as well there. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Sure. And I apologize if I missed this because I got cut off briefly. But did you say that your plans for factory loading is going to be for the back half of the year compared to the first half?
Kevin P. March
Jim, if I heard your question correctly, I think you're asking what our plans were for factory loading in the back half of the year versus the first half. Clearly, our loadings have been stepping up. Second quarter was higher than first, and we would expect third quarter to be higher than second on the basis of our growing backlog. Beyond that, we don't have enough visibility to really comment on what the fourth quarter might look like. And so we'll wait another 60 to 90 days before we comment on that. Okay, Jim, thank you.
Operator
And the next question will be from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Question on -- first on profitability. You have Analog and Embedded Processing today pretty close to historical highs. I think Analog may be high, historical highs. Embedded processing is close. Profitability, though, looks a little bit pressured though, even with less OpEx and higher gross margins this quarter. I assume that's going to get better next quarter as margins go up and OpEx come down a little bit. But could you give us some -- I guess, a little more color on how you see profitability by your business kind of trending as we go forward to the year and maybe even share anything around longer-term targets that you might want to give us?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Stacy, I'd begin by reminding you that, especially if you look at -- compare us to prior, certainly compare us year-over-year, the profitability in those 2 segments are going to be somewhat pressured by the -- typically by virtue of the fact that we've eliminated the Wireless segment. And so that means the remaining corporate expense is spread over fewer business units. And so therefore, the corporate allocations are higher. So that alone is going to be depressed in any comparisons to prior periods. The other thing, I guess, I talked about on the Embedded Processing, you may recall that about 2 years ago, we significantly began to step up the investments that we had in that area, especially in support of our objectives for our microcontroller products. And as I mentioned on last quarter's call, those investments are at a sufficient level now that they don't not -- they do not need to be increased anymore. So we're at the point now where we're really looking for revenue growth in the Embedded Processing segment to begin to generate some real profit. You may also recall that one of our more profitable pieces of that is in the comms infrastructure. And to the question we had just a moment ago, we're beginning to see some signs of that picking up this past quarter. And ideally, that continues and that generates quite a bit of additional profit fall-through as well. Did I answer your question here, Stacy?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
No, you did. That's very helpful.
Ron Slaymaker
If I can just add one thing, I think if you look at the same thing at the company level and just try to go back and leap when we just kind of went back and looked at versus prior periods in history, you can find, at least compared with the second quarter, historical periods where revenue was similar but margins, maybe, were a little higher or whatever. And as we thought to that, a lot of that really just comes down to the difference in capacity. So for example, I think one of the ones, if I remember right, was late in 2009 when we were absolutely capacity-constrained. And if you look at where we are today and our position to be able to support growth and provide service levels that our customers expect from us based upon the capacity we have, it's just really a world of difference. So we like where we are right now and we like how things are headed into the third quarter on that front as well. Do you have a follow-on?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I do. Along those lines, around the gross margin for next quarter, my math suggests you may be implicitly guiding to a margin of 54%, maybe even a little more. I guess can you give me some feeling whether or not that math is accurate and some feeling of the relative magnitudes of drivers? We have Wireless mix obviously going down, mix of investment is maybe going up, utilization going up. I think you also have some fab closures, the 6-inch fabs that start to hit in Q3, if I'm not mistaken. Can you give us some, I guess, some feeling to the relative magnitude of some of those drivers? I'd appreciate it.
Kevin P. March
Stacy, you did a good job citing the answer I would have given you to that question as to what's driving that increase in gross profit margins. You're exactly right on those points. We're probably seeing utilization with the mix improving quite a bit, and we're beginning to see the early signs. Third on that list will be some of the savings from the closure of those 2 older 6-inch factories that we talked about. But I think that it's probably a toss-up between mix and improved utilization that we see going on there. And I think as we move forward after that, it's really going to be -- mix is going to be impacting favorably our gross margins as we keep moving forward. Okay, Stacy. Thanks for your questions.
Operator
Next question will be from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
It looks to me like you're guiding your core business, like you said, Ron, up about 9%, about double normal seasonality. Could you give us any color on either the product segments or the end markets that are driving that 2x normal seasonality, please?
Ron Slaymaker
Ross, I really don't -- as is normally our practice, I don't really want to try to dissect it by end market or by product line beyond what we've identified typically. I think seasonally, we see a little additional lift from calculators and no different this time, but that's not a big factor. Probably the biggest single swing factor will be what we described already in terms of the decline for legacy wireless and, of course, that would depress from that 9% to the total amount for the company. But beyond that, we really -- I would say probably more of what we've seen in third -- in second quarter, but also I think some of the areas that were still not really lifting in second quarter and maybe holding back growth even in second quarter, seasonally, typically are stronger in third quarter. And so beyond just noting that some of the computing and handset areas see seasonal strength in third quarter, let me just kind of stop there if I can. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, and hopefully get a little closer with this one. When you talk about the OpEx side, Kevin, your color was great for the third quarter and for the full year. How should we think -- when you get to that normalized OpEx level for TI and all the cost savings, et cetera, are gone, how should we think about the growth rate in OpEx versus whatever we assume core growth in revenues would be going forward into 2014, et cetera?
Kevin P. March
Well, the kind of the high level OpEx guidelines that we have offered to the investor community is that we would expect to be operating with OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenues. I mean, clearly, what that would mean is that in periods of lower revenue, we'll be higher percent. In periods of higher revenue, lower percent. More specifically to your question as to cost trends, as I've mentioned earlier, we stepped up investment quite a bit over the last couple of years, mainly in the microcontroller portion of Embedded Processing and also in the overall sales footprint that we have on a global basis. I would expect as we look out over the next year to 2 years that, that rate of investment increase is going to slow down considerably as we begin to get revenue leverage off of that investment. So as we look forward, I would expect revenue growth to probably pretty -- provided we've got growing markets and a growing global economy, I would expect revenue growth to outstrip our OpEx growth by a fairly sizable portion. Beyond that, I won't be any more specific. But I think that you can really take that to say as we expect our overall bottom line results to continue to improve as you've seen these last few quarters. Okay, thank you, Ross.
Operator
We'll move to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Ron, in your prepared comments, you talked about SVA gaining share in the June quarter. I'm just kind of curious, given the core business expectations of kind of high-single-digit sequential growth, to what extent do you think this is share gain versus what you're seeing in the overall market? And I'm being kind of curious, if industrial and auto really drove Q3, do we expect sort of the consumer market with normal seasonality to be a bigger driver in the core business for Q -- for September, sorry?
Ron Slaymaker
I think, first of all, your comment on SVA, it did gain share in Q2. But I also said it gained share in Q1, as well as in Q4. So for the last 3 quarters, it has gained market share. I think, probably, what we would expect in Q3, very likely given that we've been gaining share, we would expect to continue to gain share in Q3 but, John, until everybody comes out with their Q3 guidance, maybe more importantly when they actually come out with actual results, we're just speculating about market share. I think it's what you said. It's probably more continued strength in the industrial and automotive areas, as well as some broadening of strength into other areas. And I think you've probably heard from multiple companies reporting now, as well as what we said, and there are certain players in the handset market that were running relatively weaker demand in Q2. And probably a lot of that had to do with some -- resetting some inventory levels in their channels, that our expectation is we'll see that strengthen back up about to, I'll call it more normalized run rates for those players in addition to the seasonal lift that comes along in the third quarter. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes, just a follow-on for Kevin. Kevin, I guess as we think about the new business model, you guys in the past kind of a target gross/op margin of, I believe, 55% and 30%. If you look at the implied guidance for the September quarter, you're basically a stone's throw away from those numbers. Kind of curious, as Wireless goes to 0 and you start to see continued leverage in the business model, should we start to be thinking about just structurally higher target growth in op margins than you've given out in the past?
Kevin P. March
John, we gave those kind of guidelines a number of years ago when we made the decision to discontinue further investment in our baseband portfolio so that we could at least give the analyst community and investors a sense as to what to expect this portfolio to be able to do. And clearly, we're beginning to see those results play themselves out. What we have talked about here in the last few quarters, in fact, even started talking about probably a year, 1.5 years ago at our analyst meeting is really a focus on cash flow. And what I would really tell you to think about is in terms of what our objectives are is to be converting 20% to 25% of our revenue into free cash flow, which, as you've heard us mention several times now, we intend to return 100% to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks less any amount that we have to use for debt repayment. So that's sort of the bottom line is our cash flow objective on this. And I expect that the actual margins in vehicle, they will fall out, they will be richer than we've historically had in the past just by virtue of the construct of our portfolio. But I won't try to offer any new numbers as to what we think target numbers are on those because we really don't want to set ourselves at that kind of limit. We're really aiming at maximizing free cash flow for our shareholders.
Ron Slaymaker
So, John, since that was your follow-up question, I don't believe you're on the line. Let me ask and, in fact, answer the natural follow-up to your follow-up, which is, okay, so with free cash flow margin objectives of 20% to 25% and just reporting 24% for the trailing 12-month period, are those objectives, in fact, something that should be reviewed? And I guess the way we look at that -- now, I'm going to answer part of the -- of your question. The way we look at that is that at current levels, we're now operating in the top 15th -- 1-5, top 15th percentile of the S&P 500. And that really just reflects the strength of our business model. And so do we -- is 20% to 25% the right number going forward? The way we will evaluate that is if we get to the point where we're consistently performing above that level, we'll then consider whether we should change the range, but right now, our margin objective as a corporation is to convert 20% to 25% of revenue to free cash flow, as Kevin said. So, John, thanks for those great questions.

At this time, we'll go to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Can you talk about the linearity of bookings during the quarter? And then considering how the product mix and market mix has changed, what should we be thinking about for normal seasonality for Q4?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So the linearity question, the answer is probably pretty similar to what it normally is, which is orders were noisy in the quarter. You can't look at it month-to-month and try to draw any straight line in one direction or the other. It probably was a little bit even more so this quarter, Chris, because you noted we said that customers were giving us more extended visibility. And so depending upon when those customers chose to load up in terms of the backlog for the out-quarter, that drove some of the noisiness. So it was a little more so than normal, and I'll give you one example. Comm's infrastructure had an especially strong May, and that was exactly what I was describing. They were going from -- I don't know their exact numbers but let's say they had 3 months of visibility on our backlog placed then they were pushing out to 4, 4.5 months, that pretty much got loaded in during the month of May and created some of the noisiness. So there was some of that stuff going on. I don't know in terms of, with all the changes in our portfolio, whether that's going to translate to anything different for Q4, Chris. I think we've kind of just have to move forward. We're probably -- given the breadth of Analog and Embedded Processing, you can probably just go look at more industry numbers and try to assess. Clearly, Q3, if you just look at average growth, has historically 5-year average been 5%. Again, we always give the caution, the range on that is huge. It was 0% to 17%. I'm not sure how useful that amount, that 5% number is. Fourth quarter is down more so. In fact, if you just look at the average, it's down 8%. I think that is a completely not useful number because of the noise that fourth quarter '08, I believe it was, introduced into that, where we had a down 26% quarter. The high point on that is down to like, I think -- I'm sorry, the range was minus 26% to plus 4%. I think kind of got what a normal Q4 is probably down a little bit because semiconductor products probably tend to move more sideways in that Q4 type of time period. And then you probably have some -- the pressure of calculators coming off of their back-to-school peak in Q3 pushing down into Q4. But that's clearly not evident in the average 5-year growth rate numbers that I just gave you. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes. Can you just maybe give us a sense of what the inventory did during the quarter and how their bookings pattern is? Is there any commentary you're hearing from them?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't have bookings. I think we said in prepared remarks that the inventory declined and yet -- so that actually, at an absolute dollar basis, went down to a little under 5.5 weeks -- I'm sorry, let me start that over. From a -- an absolute dollar standpoint, distributor inventory was stable. From a days, it went down about 1 day to below 5.5 weeks in the quarter. Okay, Chris. Thank you.

We'll go to Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Ron, and this is not a follow-up to any follow-up, but it's a follow-up to your prepared remarks. Clarification on the connectivity, who did you sell it to? And then I'm assuming this includes only the handset-related business and not the embedded part.
Kevin P. March
Ambrish, we won't disclose who it was we entered into that transaction with. I would just mention again, it was further efforts on our part to try to monetize those prior investments in that technology. What we transferred was their -- a right for that buyer to use that technology, including some tangible deliverables that we provided to that particular buyer. It's a nonexclusive arrangement. It allows us to fully use the technology just as we have in the past, and importantly to continue to pursue the market strategies that we have for that, which was really to take that technology into places where it's beginning to emerge in the -- I think, the common term is the Internet of Things, but to more and more different areas where we're finding wireless connectivity kind of technology being useful and emerging.
Ron Slaymaker
But think of it more along the lines of the legacy wireless as opposed to the Embedded business. So we don't believe this will have any impact, you might say, on our embedded opportunity going forward. Again, it's just means by which we're continuing to monetize that legacy wireless business. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Yes, I did, on the core business, Ron and Kevin. Good to see the SVA kind of on that trajectory that you've laid out. The last couple of quarters, it's done well. Can you just help us understand -- and I don't mean to make light of it because market share gains are never easy. But was it just blocking and tackling stuff or -- because it couldn't be new products that have been developed since the acquisition? So just any color you could provide on what has been working would be great.
Kevin P. March
Yes, I would say, Ambrish, perhaps what you're beginning to see here, that remember that that's really -- SVA has a lot of its revenue going through the industrial channel, as well as the automotive and clearly, those markets have been doing well. But importantly, the industrial, it means a lot of customers, including a lot of small customers. And that's where the benefit of an extremely large sales force plays in versus what national could have done on its own in the past. We simply didn't have the sales force scale to be able to reach out to as many customers. So I think the combination of nice growth in the markets in which it's in and the fact that we're able to get that products out to a lot more customers in those spaces are coming together to help us see some nice growth in that. And then overall, that's just better commercial terms with customers. You may recall that they had previously gotten themselves into a little bit of hot water with some customers where they were no longer welcome on designs. And we've been welcomed back in. And those -- some of those designs are, in fact, already beginning to turn into -- some of those all already turning into incremental revenue.
Ron Slaymaker
But let me just add, Ambrish, you recall that when we announced that acquisition, we said the entire basis on which we're going to generate a return on this acquisition is based on revenue synergies that we thought possible, not really cost synergies. I mean, there were some cost synergies, but they were minor compared to the revenue synergies that we thought were possible through our combination. So it's absolutely -- I'll understate it and call it encouraging to see those revenue synergies coming through, coming through at the rate they are and on the timeline they are. So really good news from our perspective there. Okay, Ambrish. Thank you for your questions.

At this time, we'll go to Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
Hey, Kevin or Ron, just one question on the underutilization charges. What were they in the second quarter and what do you project that number to be in the third quarter?
Kevin P. March
Sumit, we haven't been providing a projection on that, but they were a little bit less than $100 million in the quarter...
Ron Slaymaker
And downsized. As we said, that was beneficial to TI last quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Sumit?
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
I do. Just a clarification again. You said that dollar inventories were roughly flat in distribution, down on a days’ basis. And -- but you said resales are up 5%, but your organic business grew 8%. Just trying to understand what sort of the -- how do I reconcile all of that? In other words, the organic business being up 8%, but your resales being up only 5%, but inventories being flat?
Ron Slaymaker
I think obviously, this is just different cross currents in distribution and that customer base than what we have overall and what we have associated with our direct business. So I wouldn't -- I mean, I think we clearly understand it. But I guess I would say it's really just to be very customer-specific in terms of -- I think what you're really asking is why were resales growing slower than TI's revenue overall. And I would just say it tends to get customer-specific that I don't want to get into. Also keep in mind, our overall business benefits from the lift that we see in calculators. And again, that would be TI revenue as opposed to the resales and then also some of the market-specific things. But again, it gets somewhat market-specific but also customer-specific there. Okay, Sumit. Thank you for your questions.
Operator
And we'll move along to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
Kevin, on the prepaid, it was about a $300 million use of cash due to the, my understanding, I guess it's a tech transfer. So does that reverse and unwind? Has that become a source of cash? And could you just go through the accounting mechanics on that?
Kevin P. March
Sure, Mark. The way that works is as we have met the requirements of the agreement that we signed late in the quarter, it was a recognizable event. And therefore, it was recognized into earnings. The payment terms were such that we don't expect to get paid on the majority of that until this quarter. So in fact, exactly what you said is what'll occur, it -- because it's in net income, it's taken out on the prepaid line and other assets, so that appears to be a use of cash. And in fact, it will reverse itself when we move into the third quarter because we, in fact, had already received the payment that was due in the third quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Mark?
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
Yes. And a simple question. The -- so when your dollars of distributed inventories are flat, does that mean your resales equal your sell-in?
Ron Slaymaker
When dollars are flat, does that mean resales equal sell-in? Not necessarily, because it depends upon what distributor was -- the distributors were doing with inventory in the prior quarter. So for example, if -- you just have to play with the numbers. But if they were reducing inventory one quarter, they held that inventory flat the next quarter, you could see resales trend -- resale growth trend well below our revenue growth as revenue, kind of call it snapped back to the way it was shipping out. But there's not always a direct -- what do I say, there's not always a direct alignment between revenue growth or shipment into distribution and what they're shipping out because it varies based on what they've been doing in terms of adding or depleting inventory. And clearly, with us having customers -- I'm sorry, distributors converting to consignment, that can impact us as well because the impact of a consignment conversion is the -- is basically they're depleting inventory and depleting at a lesser rate as we go forward.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
So, Ron, so just -- and I apologize if I missed this, so what were resales versus sell-in?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't know. I had resales about -- let's see. We said resales were up 3% (sic) [5%] . Off the top of my head, I don't have -- I don't -- I have sell-in, actually it was up just slightly more in that a couple of points more than that is what it looks like. Okay, thank you, Mark.
Operator
And moving forward, we'll go to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Any notable changes in lead times and anything that you might -- that you think might probably trend higher in the back half of the year?
Ron Slaymaker
Lead times, I would say generally pretty stable with the vast majority of our products shipping in less than 6 weeks. So no real change there, Joe. Do you have a follow-on?
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Yes, and if there's any color you can give us on end market dynamics and the stuff you've mentioned in terms of computing or automotive or anything like that.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I have a couple of comments here. So industrial, I guess, you've -- we've seen from what we're saying already, that market continues to recover. I would say in general, customers in that space are pretty hand to mouth. They're keeping inventories lean. We have not seen signs of any kind of broad replenishment there. And lead times for our products there are short and they're taking advantage of that. In terms of automotive, we've -- you've heard us say our revenue was strong. That goes across both Analog, as well as Embedded Processing. Part of that is clearly the market, the end market is strong. Part of it is TI is benefiting from design wins really in a couple of areas. One is the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, as well as infotainment. We're also seeing new opportunities in a couple of areas, advanced radar systems. You've seen, for example, that partly the drivers there, such as blind spot detection. But we're seeing radar technology in automobiles start to get deployed much broader than just certainly [ph] considerations, much broader than just blind spot detection. Computing, no surprise there. The news flash is the overall PC market has been weak, continues to be weak. We'll see what happens when some of the new processors get introduced here in the second half, but that space has been weak. Comms infrastructure, I think I've pretty much said what I can say about that. Communications or handsets rather, the probably -- the big story for TI is just ongoing declines in legacy wireless. I think we're actually doing pretty well in the broader handset market with some of the other products we have, like audio amplifiers, et cetera. But if you just look at that market overall, it's getting, for TI, swamped out by what's happening at certain customers in terms of their own adjustments, but then also our legacy wireless trends. And then the consumer, I would just say that game consoles were weak last quarter as we have manufacturers in that space preparing for new product introductions and transitions here in the second half. Television, I would describe as generally weak. I think there's new technologies that are being introduced that hold some promise for growth there. But overall, I would say the market is weak. And that's about it. So all right, Joe. Thank you for your questions.
Operator
And we'll move along to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I wanted to address this demand environment question I think being asked in different ways from a geographic perspective. How much of the growth that you're seeing right now is U.S. centric versus, say, coming from China and Europe? Because the macro data points from China and Europe are still quite mixed. So if you could just get us -- give us a sense of how demand is from a geographic perspective?
Ron Slaymaker
So let me just give you the data and then I'll let you figure out how to interpret it. But if you look at our revenue in the second quarter, we saw the highest growth, and this was just on a dollar basis, out of Asia, followed by the U.S., followed by Japan. Europe was down what I would characterize as little, meaning a couple of percent. But all regions were up. Asia was the strongest from a dollar standpoint, but it's also where -- over what, 60%, 65% of our revenue is shipping these days. And then U.S. was the strongest in terms of percentage growth, but it's much smaller than what Asia is for us. And then the only caution to that, that I always attach to that is you have to be a little careful. I mean, Asia is where a lot products are being manufactured and then turned around and shipped back to other markets such as the U.S. for consumption. So it's not a statement about economic conditions or changes there in those markets, it's strictly a matter of our customers manufacturing in those various regions. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. Thanks, Ron. Just as a clarification, what percentage of the sales now are dist versus direct? And then within that, if you could give us a split of sell-in versus sell-through?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So 55% of our revenue goes to distribution now. If you look at that distribution revenue, about 50% of that is now supported by consignment. So as a proxy for your sell-in versus sell-out, officially and technically, we're on sell-in recognition with distribution. But the half of the revenue that's on consignment behaves like sell-out in that the distributors' revenue doesn't get recognized until they pull it out of that consignment hardware, out of that consignment inventory to then directly ship it to a customer. So it behaves like sell-out. Just more broadly, about 45% of our overall revenue now is supported by consignment and/or JIT programs. And so if you kind of put all that together, that means that only about 1/4 of our revenue is not on consignment or on -- or in distribution. The reason I point out is because where we have consignment, we have really good visibility into that customer's or distributor's TI inventory levels. And, in fact, for distributors more broadly, even where they're not on consignment, we know what their TI inventory is. So the point being, for about 75% of our, I'll call revenue coverage, we have pretty good insight into inventories. And when we characterize them as lean or well-managed, I guess, is maybe a different word to think of as of now, we do that with pretty direct visibility. The 25% that's not on consignment or not a distribution, we have the same kind of visibility as any supplier where that's on a normal backlog where you talk to customers, but we're not seeing it directly. But for 75%, we have good visibility and we feel good about where inventories are right now in our channels and that our customers. Okay, Vivek. Thank you for your questions.
Operator
At this time, we'll take a question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Just a question about some of the extended visibility you said your customers are providing to you. With the lead times not really changed, why do you think the customers are giving you that extended visibility? I guess is it just as simple as they're feeling more confident about the business in the second half? Could you give a little more color on that?
Ron Slaymaker
I think it's a combination of things. I think that's part of it. So as they get more comfortable with their own forecast and their own outlook, they are -- they're more comfortable putting, call it commitment that's associated with backlog on their suppliers. So I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it, and I don't know how to weigh one versus the other is that frankly, I think TI's or some of TI's competitors are out talking to customers, kind of signaling potential upcoming lead time extensions. And when that happens, the customers, for their own benefit, go ahead and try to get backlog placed. And typically, when they do that, they don't just place backlog where they think lead times are going out. They're going to place backlog for full system. And so they're -- we're seeing some of that as well. So I think, again, some of it is customers -- I'm sorry, competitor-induced where they're concerned about their ability to support the full customer demand and their capacity situation, and then the other part of it is just customers' increased confidence in their own demand for their own products. Okay, Chris. Do you have a follow-on?
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Yes. And I guess just following up on that, and I guess to the extent that you have the visibility, do you see the customers and distributors wanting to put on a little more inventory as we go through the holiday season and, again, realizing that your capacity utilization is still probably a lot lower than your competitors, I guess you would see that as an opportunity to kind of pick up some market share there?
Ron Slaymaker
Again, I don't know that -- there's probably some natural inventory that goes along with getting ready for a seasonal holiday build. I don't know at this point that I would just try to distinguish between just higher demand versus inventory replenishment, especially where we have consignment. As I said for distribution, that's 75% of our revenue inventory build of TI chips. Now that's not reflecting us anything about the customers' end product inventory situation. But inventory of TI chips, there is no thing -- no such thing. Basically, we manage the consignment inventory to a certain turns level, so we take responsibility for that. Okay, Chris. Thank you for your questions.
Operator
This question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
My first question is on CapEx. I know in the past, you talked about having sufficient capacity right now to get to about $18 billion in revenue, meaning keeping the CapEx level pretty low. But is it safe to say that $97 million here this quarter is sort of the low for at least the near term?
Kevin P. March
Tore, we are still holding our forecast for the year at about $500 million. We, as you pointed out, spent $97 million this quarter and we spent about $84 million last quarter. You may recall that we did announce that we were acquiring an assembly test site in Chengdu, China. And, of course, that will require some cash in the second half for us to go ahead and close on that transaction. But I expect that we'll still stay in our $500 million, inside that overall budget for the year. And then going forward, again, for modeling purposes, I would expect us to be at above 4% of revenues going into CapEx, up to $18 billion of revenue, at which point in time, that may change. Although I would also point out, it is our objective to keep watching for inexpensive capacity and to the extent that we can get that and extend that $18 billion ceiling for variable prices, we will be very opportunistic and open to that strategy.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Tore. Do you have follow-on question?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes, just one follow-up. I know this is a segment that you didn't discuss much on this call but it's certainly a high-profile segment. But the Analog business that sell into smartphones and tablets, could you talk a little bit about how that's faring in the current environment, please?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I guess what I would say is from a -- just even in things like I probably mentioned mid-quarter and I probably might have mentioned earlier in this call, in areas like audio amplifiers, relatively low-profile devices, we don't -- they don't get headlined a lot or whatever, but we have a pretty strong and broad position in the handsets with those types of products. So we feel good about our progress there and position. That also being said, those markets are more vertical, they're more concentrated. And so in this kind of environment, meaning second quarter when you have big customers making inventory adjustments or whatever, they catch up that part of our business as well as all of our competitors that play into those spaces. So we did see some softness associated with that in the second quarter. The good news is, again, our exposure there is much lower than it has historically been as it is in the PC market. And so when you get those vertical markets, making those kinds of adjustments, it doesn't have the same kind of impact on TI that certainly it would have in our past. So hopefully, that answers your question.
And with that, we're going to wrap up. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' Second Quarter 2013 Mid-Quarter Update Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference call over to your host, Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the second quarter of 2013. Dave Pahl, from our Investor Relations team, is also joining me today.
In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company. In general, we will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segments or end markets, and I will not address details of profit margins.
In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information. As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings around the middle of our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $2.99 billion and $3.11 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.39 and $0.43.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?

Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Obviously, you're guiding in line on revenues, again [ph] but I'm wondering if within the mix of your business, there was any deviations from what you thought might occur over the course of the quarter, either product mix or geographic mix?
Ron Slaymaker
I can give you some review of that, Glen. As you noted, I think the quarter is generally tracking consistent with our expectations. Along those lines, strength has broadened across both customers and markets during the quarter as we had expected when we gave our April guidance. The strength in the industrial market that we saw in the first quarter has continued into the second quarter. And just as a reminder, the industrial market, it's important to us today, but we expect it will be even more important to our future as we really focus more and more of our investments in that space. We serve that market mostly through catalog product lines, such as Silicon Valley Analog, our high-performance analog product line, as well as some of the product lines in Embedded Processing, such as microcontrollers. Automotive also continues to grow, such as we saw in the first quarter. We serve the automotive market through a range of products, including both catalog and application-specific analog products, OMAP applications, processors and also DLP products.
In the communications market, we're seeing some growth in communications infrastructure this quarter on a sequential basis, as well as some growth in handsets. And the handset has really been through a range of catalog products such as audio amplifiers that we sell into that space. Revenue from our legacy wireless product lines will decline sequentially as we continue to wind them down and as we had expected and communicated.
PCs and notebooks are weak this quarter, as we had expected. And then finally, I would note that consumer is mixed with areas like gaming consoles, weak -- specifically, gaming consoles, weak, and other areas in consumer mostly tracking sideways this quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes, Ron. As I hear you say things like industrial is going to become a greater proportion of your business and as you think forward as TI is obviously still in the sort of the mix of some degree of transition, can you describe what your model is going to look like 2 or 3 years from now? I know it's rare to get a long sort of question on this kind of call, but just -- do you feel like you have room for your model to improve from where it stands today? Do you think it's sort of an upwards-facing trajectory?
Ron Slaymaker
Glen, I'm not going to break from the model that we've communicated previously, which is our expectation that we certainly have the capacity and the expectation to generate 20% to 25% of free cash flow from our revenue. That being said, clearly, with the capacity position we have, which is very strong, and an improving product mix, and if you look at, for example, gross margin and the income statement side of things, just -- a simple thing I'd point out is last year, depreciation was 7.5% of revenue, and capital spending is -- was actually below 4% of revenue, and we expect that it'll hold at that level until we're able to cross $18 billion of revenue. So I think, clearly, you would expect that financially, we have room for improvement and a pretty good runway ahead of us there. Okay, Glen. I appreciate your questions.
Operator
Next caller will be John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Let me ask the question. The first question, Ron, just quickly, as far as the trajectory of this upturn, if you look at your June quarter guidance, it's coming in more along seasonal lines than kind of above seasonal. I'm just kind of curious if you think that that's a reflection of just still uncertainty in the macro environment because typically, the first quarter, off the bottom, you tend to see better-than-seasonal growth. So I'm trying to get a sense of how you guys are kind of viewing the cyclical recovery for the industry?
Ron Slaymaker
John, I think what we're seeing thus far is a very well-behaved recovery. And clearly, what can cause rapid acceleration would be things like lead times starting to extend and then customers feeling they need to layer in more inventory, and that causes a surge in demand that causes lead times to go out further. And frankly, that is not a particularly healthy environment; one where the macro is providing support for growth in the electronics industry, which then puts higher demand on our product, where we're able, as we are right now, both because of our strong capacity position to maintain lead times that are short, and also with our inventory position to be able to service customer demand as it comes in, that is a very well-behaved and well-controlled upturn. And frankly, versus the former case, we would much rather have a well-behaved upturn. So again, this is mid-quarter, we still have to go through this quarter and we'll see what's ahead, but what we're seeing right now is very encouraging in terms of growth -- the broadening of growth, as I said earlier, across customers in various end markets and especially our ability to service that demand in an environment, frankly, where, when we look across various competitors, we're already seeing some things that make us believe that -- competitors, for example, are taking actions to try to get customers to give more extended visibility to avoid lead time extensions. We've seen upside demand from particular customers in, what I'll call, an unfair share of demand coming TI's way, where customers are citing competitors that are not able to respond to their increased demand in a near-term type of environment. So again, we find the current environment very encouraging right now. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Maybe, just to follow on from that, can you quantify kind of what the share gains might be for you guys in this environment? Because clearly, some of the rationale of being -- of having as much capacity as you do was the ability to gain share. So when you look at the June guidance, what do you think is industry growth versus, perhaps, TI gaining share?
Ron Slaymaker
That's really impossible for us to know or for us to even get that at this point, John. And I'm not trying to imply that you're going to see some big step function in terms of share gains for TI. That's not the case. And frankly, even though I do believe -- I agree with what you're saying that the capacity position that we are in can be and is starting to become a competitive advantage for TI even here and now today. That really was not the rationalization. The rationalization was we got really good prices on that capacity, and we're going to be able to generate really good returns on that capacity over a 20- to 25-year period. So certainly, certain periods like we're starting to enter, it can be a near-term competitive advantage, but we really look at those capacity investments more from the standpoint of some really attractive returns we're going to be able to generate on those investments going forward. Okay, John. Thank you for questions.

Next question with J.P. Morgan, Christopher Danely.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Last quarter, on the update, you talked about how your book-to-bill was trending. Can you just talk about how bookings and backlog are trending, and remind us what a typical Q3 sequential growth looks like?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Chris, and I'm going to -- I'll answer your question on backlog and bookings. And Dave, I'll let you answer the question about typical Q3. So I would say, in general, I would describe orders this quarter as strong. We've seen turns levels that we expected would be high because of our short lead times and in just the nature of the customer right now to try to stay hand-to-mouth. They have been high this quarter as -- but again that really ties to our ability to deliver strongly in terms of service levels and on-time delivery with those short lead times. That being said, I'll also note that we are building backlog again this quarter. So to your question on book-to-bill, it is expanding. It's greater than 1 again this quarter. And I would say that customers are beginning to provide a little more extended visibility for TI with their backlog, in this case, giving us some visibility out into third quarter, even. Dave, do you want to talk about typical third quarter rates?
David Pahl
Yes. I'll -- Chris, I'll give you our average sequential growth in third quarter, and this is just our numbers. All-in, we have seen a 5%, on average, increase over second quarter and the third quarter. And I'll just remind you, on those 5 data points, obviously, very noisy, and the range on those 5 data points range from flat to up 17. So I can tell it's pretty noisy from that standpoint. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes. So I think in response to John's question, you mentioned that you've been able to gain share because some of your competitors weren't able to. Can you maybe expand on that? Do you see your competitors' lead times stretching out? Or just leaving the customers winding down, maybe talk about that a little bit and how you're able to react to that?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris -- and again, that was a pretty narrow example I gave. It's one of those things you would expect to see early in a recovery. I don't want to try to translate it into some big, broad trend in the industry. But what I would say is we have seen where customers' demand for their products are starting to pick up, they're coming in with relatively near-term requests in terms of wanting product. I don't know so much that the competitor, in this particular case, was extending lead times or anything like that. It was just probably an inside lead time request from the customer, the competitor couldn't deliver to it, and we could. And so we got our unfair share of, or I shouldn't say, unfair share of that business, we got our due share of that business but it shifted somewhat from a competitor more directly to TI. Okay. Chris, thanks for your questions.
Operator
David Wong with Wells Fargo has our next question.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Just to push a bit further on Chris' question, the bookings, did you actually see the momentum -- have you been seeing it grow through the quarter? Has it -- that each week, you see a higher level of bookings or are you're saying that it's staying on a high plateau that it began with?
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, David, that kind of order linearity question always -- I guess, what I would say is we felt, in general, throughout the quarter that orders have been strong. It hasn't been every day-by-day or week-by-week getting stronger, as any quarter, noisy. But in general, I would describe the order trends this quarter as having been strong. Do you have a follow-on, David?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes. Could you give us any sort of feel for what the sequential growth of your core business is? If we sort of back out, I mean, your guidance, what that implies for your core business, because you have got some business that you're exiting that are coming down and you have the seasonality of your calculator business, right? I mean, is it still about 5% to 6% sequential growth for your core semiconductor business?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, David. I think a couple of things there. The calculator growth typically adds about 3 points of growth to our third quarter. And as you've pointed out, the decline in legacy wireless this quarter will have about that same impact or an offsetting impact, meaning that just that the legacy wireless revenue will lower our sequential growth by about 3 points alone. So those -- the legacy wireless and the calculator trends for the most part are offsetting. And so that would give you an indication of where analog and embedded are. And they may not -- again, we see differences within those areas. So like I said, HPA, or high-performance analog, and the Silicon Valley Analog, both with their very good exposure into the industrial and automotive markets, will probably run a little bit above that and some other areas will be running a little bit below that, but kind of a normal mix up there. Thank you for your questions, David.
Operator
Romit Shah with Nomura Sec will have our next question.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
A couple of the other diversified semi-companies, Avago and Microchip, have raised guidance recently or talked about accelerating trends in the industrial space. How do you guys reconcile that versus your comment that business is good but at -- from your comments, it doesn't sound like it's better than what you thought when you gave guidance back in April.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Well, I will take a stab at that. I think in the case of Microchip, their recent guidance raise took their midpoint to 5.5%, which was slightly below the midpoint of growth for which -- for the revenue range that we initially described in April and are reaffirming today. I know Analog Devices came out not too long ago with their guidance for -- they're off, I believe, by a month versus our quarter, but the midpoint of their guidance is 2%. So -- and to be honest, I didn't follow the details of Avago, but I think, when I look at the peer guidance and what we're seeing, I think we're seeing very similar and describing very similar things in our markets. Do you have a follow-on Romit?
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Yes, just any visibility you could give us on the Comm infrastructure space. And you mentioned that it was a growth area this quarter, but how are you thinking about China LTE going into the back half of the year?
David Pahl
I'll take that one, Romit. And let me make it the comment in the context of Embedded Processing. So we do expect that we will have growth in Embedded Processing, both driven from industrial, as well as automotive markets and in addition to communications infrastructure. So -- and we're seeing that strength in Comm's infrastructure primarily driven by -- spending by North American operators and, I'd say, with some signs of increased activity inside of China. So we're beginning to see that benefit flow-through the business.
Operator
Timothy Arcuri with Cowen has our next question.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
May I ask a little bit about distributor inventory? If you look at some of the companies that recognize revenue on sell-in, they had some of the best guidance for the June quarter relative to normal seasonal. So I'm wondering, does that imply that the channel is building some inventory in June? Can you talk a little bit about that?
David Pahl
Yes, Tim. I'll take that question. I would say, overall, our expectation for resales through distribution will be that it'll grow a few points sequentially. And if you look at the inventory that they own, we think that, that should hold about the same level as what we exited last quarter at, and that's around 5.5 weeks. So definitely, lean by any measure that we'd have. I'd also remind you that about half of our distribution inventory is supported by our consignment program. So the fact that we do recognize everything technically by a shift in method, that inventory and/or sales behave exactly as if it were sell-through. So do have a follow-on, Tim?
Ron Slaymaker
So some of the swings that you might normally see for sell-in type of players with inventory building and depleting will be dampened as we move more revenue toward consignment. Do you have a -- Tim, do you have a follow-on question?
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I do, Ron. Yes. This might be mincing hairs, but when you guided June, you said that TV was going to be a bit weak. And now, you're saying that within the consumer sector, that only gaming is weak. So does that imply that TV was a little bit better than you thought?
Ron Slaymaker
Tim, I might be wrong, and you have -- you may have your notes directly in front of you from that last quarter call. But I believe, when I talked about what we were seeing in television in April, that was really referencing the first quarter more so than our expectations for second quarter. We normally try not to get into a lot of end market-specific expectations for our guidance. So to my knowledge, TV has not weakened versus our expectations. My understanding is that what we're seeing in the television market currently is some growth in the very large screen segment of the market and really not much growth in the kind of midsize and smaller-screen market. But I'm not aware that there has been a change in trend other than what -- at least from our expectations. Okay. Tim, thanks for your questions.
Operator
Next one will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Can you talk about the factory utilization, Ron? Any changes versus what you were planning back in April?
Ron Slaymaker
Dave?
David Pahl
Yes, Vivek. We're expecting utilization to be up this quarter, basically just supporting the higher level of demand that we see coming in.
Ron Slaymaker
Vivek, we don't really have comments on whether it's changed versus our expectations in April for you, though. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. This is probably slightly unrelated questions to what you generally comment on the call, but is there a way to tactically use your excess capacity as a foundry for other customers that don't compete with you?
Ron Slaymaker
I guess, theoretically, we could, but we have no intention to do that. In fact, if you fill that capacity up with, I don't care whether it's low margin -- I mean, whether it's foundry or just low-margin business in general, then when you need it, you have the capacity utilized, and that's not what our strategy is. We do not believe that we have too much capacity today. As we explained in our call back in February on our capital management strategy, our strategy for capacity is to purchase it opportunistically and therefore get good prices for it, and then to position that capacity ahead of -- or well ahead of demand. So our view is as growth returns, and it is already, our capacity is quickly becoming a competitive advantage for TI, as I said before. I know there's a lot of discussion. It seems like -- amongst analysts and investors about pressure on gross margins, what I would say is just keep in mind, only about half of the underutilization expense that's associated with our capacity is cash-based. The other half is a non-cash-based. So it has really pretty minimal impact on our cash flow. So I think more importantly, having our -- the strong capacity that we do have and having it acquired at the kind of very attractive prices that we did by buying it when, frankly, there wasn't a lot of demand for the capacity in our industry from other competitors, means that our free cash flow is going to be strongly benefited not only today but also in the future. And I know I mentioned before, but I'll just reiterate: our capital expenditures are already at historic lows, and we're going to be able to sustain those low levels for years ahead. So getting those assets for pennies on the dollar are going to provide years of benefit to our free cash flow, and as you've heard us say before, that higher free cash flow is what allows us then to commit to higher returns to our shareholders, both dividends and repurchases. So while some may be sitting on the sidelines waiting for gross margins to start to lift, our free cash flow is already lifting, and in fact, you've seen the benefit in the form of higher dividends and repurchases. Okay, Thank you for your questions, Vivek. And operator, I think we have time for one more caller.
Operator
Certainly, sir, and that will come from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Ron, can I focus in a little bit on the CapEx? How are you running quarter to date there? And is there any -- should we be thinking that your capital spend this year could have some lumpiness? I believe I saw an announcement of some investment in assembly and test assets?
Ron Slaymaker
Doug, I think -- I don't have a mid-quarter update on our capital expenditures. What I can say is that we are confident in the kind of guidance that we've provided, which I believe is $500 million of capital expenditures for the year. Those can always be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but the $500 million is our plan. And I think there's no reason for us to believe otherwise. And just -- by the way, I should compare, our guidance on depreciation is $900 million. So you know what's going to happen to that as we hold capital spending at lower levels. I think the -- what you might be referring to is, in terms of the assembly test site, is last week, we announced that we had selected the location of Chengdu in China, where we already have an existing wafer fab as the site for our next assembly test facility. But there will be -- that will not create any lumpiness in terms of capital expenditures. And what I mean by that is we will continue to spend -- that will not impact our $500 million forecast for this year. It will not impact our guidance that we will be able to maintain CapEx at 4% of revenue until we achieve or exceed $18 billion of revenue. And then from then, we'll be tracking probably 4% to 7% of revenue. The Chengdu announcement, we also talked about that our future investments in that location could total up to $1.69 billion. But keep in mind, that's over the next 15 years. So -- and when you're making these kinds of long-range site-type planning for our manufacturing operations, they genuinely are long-range. You have to get sites selected well in advance of actually spending money, and that's really what that announcement was all about. Do you have a follow-on question, Doug?
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
I do, and that gives me that clarification, that was exactly what I was looking for. The follow-on question, though, is a little bit of a clarification to the way you answered a few questions earlier this afternoon. One, it was in regards to Q3 seasonal pattern. And then the other, I felt like you were possibly answering the seasonal impact of Q2. So I just want to make sure I understand the 5% average guidance for -- growth for Q3 and what that would look like excluding the impact of the business change mix that we're expected to experience?
Ron Slaymaker
And there, you -- you're talking specifically about the legacy wireless business? So what Dave provided was just that Q3, on average, over the last 5 years, has grown 5% sequentially. I think he said it had a 0% to 17% range. And so you can decide whether that 5% average number is particularly useful. So that's what we've done over the last 5 years. This quarter, if you say -- I think in April, we indicated that our wireless revenue, the legacy wireless revenue, would decline about $60 million from the Q1 level, which was $210 million. So that would put it roughly in the range of $150 million in the current quarter. I don't have a specific update for you here at the mid-quarter on that number, but our expectation is that $150 million or so of legacy wireless revenue in second quarter will continue to decline until it's essentially 0 going into the -- by the first quarter of 2014. So that would be a consideration just as it is a consideration this quarter. So Dave, nor I, we're trying to specifically endorse that average growth rate for Q3 for this particular, we were just communicating what that average growth rate has been historically. Okay. Doug. Thank you for your questions. And before we end the call, let me remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you, and good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments 1Q '13 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 10. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.
Business in the quarter strengthened steadily. You will recall that in our mid-quarter update, we narrowed revenue to the upper half of the original range we set in January. In the end, we finished just below the top of our range. This is a healthy environment, where customers are maintaining lean inventory levels and are relying on TI's short product lead times, well-positioned inventory and strong manufacturing capacity to give them what they want when they want it.
As our revenue built in the quarter, it fell through nicely to profit. EPS of $0.32 was at the top of our range of expectations. As we review our first quarterly report for 2013, I believe it is important to note that TI is now a company firmly rooted in Analog and Embedded Processing. These 2 areas made up 77% of our revenue in the quarter, a full 500 basis points more than a year ago. This makes us less dependent on any one customer and on any one end market. As we've noted previously, our largest customer is now in the mid-single digits as a percentage of our total revenue.
As more of our revenue comes from Analog and Embedded Processing, our market exposure has also expanded favorably. Today, 35% of our revenue comes from the industrial and automotive markets, more than from the communications market and more than from the computing market. Each of these markets is important, and with more balance in the mix of revenue from each, we expect steadier growth and better returns.
The strength of our business model gives us confidence that we can sustainably generate $0.20 to $0.25 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue, and then return all of it to shareholders except what is required to repay debt. You saw that confidence exhibited in the first quarter, as we raised our dividend by 33% to $1.12 per share annualized and added another $5 billion of share repurchase authorization.
In considering our performance and valuation, we believe it is important to pay attention to cash flow from operations and especially to the free cash flow we're generating, in addition to our income statement and balance sheet. We think free cash flow is important for a couple of reasons. First, over the past few years, net income has lagged the amount of free cash that TI generates, and we expect this to continue for a number of years. In fact, free cash flow was more than net income in 4 of the past 5 years. In 2012 alone, free cash flow exceeded net income by $1.16 billion.
So why does free cash flow exceed net income and why will this continue? Two primary factors are the amortization of acquisition intangibles associated with National, which will run about $320 million per year for the next 6 years. Also, depreciation expense exceeds our capital expenditure needs, thanks to the strong capacity position we currently have installed and the long life of our manufacturing equipment for Analog and Embedded Processing.
In 2012, depreciation exceeded CapEx by $462 million, and our guidance reflects about a $400 million difference in 2013. We expect it will be several more years before this gap closes, considering that our capital expenditures should remain at low levels.
The second reason we believe free cash flow is important is that cash returns are an important element of shareholders returns. The more free cash we can generate, the more cash we intend to return to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This is an important benefit to our long-term investors.
The end result is that free cash flow, when considered on a trailing 12-month basis, is an important metric for our investors to assess the value of the enterprise and one that determines how much cash we can return to them. Of course, in the short term, any quarterly metric can vary significantly with seasonality and other factors. This is often noise and may not correlate with long-term changes in the intrinsic value of the company.
Let me now walk through the quarter's results. I'll note that this is our first financial report based on our updated segment reporting structure. Please see our earnings release for a description of these changes. We have also provided historical information for the new segments on the IR page of our website.
Revenue of $2.89 billion declined 8% from a year ago and 3% sequentially. The largest part of the decline in both comparisons was from our legacy wireless products. Analog revenue declined 2% from a year ago and was about even sequentially. From a year ago, Silicon Valley Analog had the largest decline, mostly reflecting its ongoing conversion to a consignment inventory program with our distributors. Sequentially, growth was greatest in Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog, 2 product lines with strong exposure to the industrial market. Growth in these areas was offset by lower revenue in High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management. Silicon Valley Analog's rate of conversion to consignment at distribution was about the same this quarter as last, but this was not a significant factor in the sequential growth rate.
Embedded Processing increased 4% from a year ago and 3% sequentially, with growth in microcontrollers the biggest factor in both comparisons. Our Other segment revenue declined 24% from a year ago and 12% sequentially. In both comparisons, legacy wireless products were the biggest factor in the decline. Revenue from these products was $200 million -- $210 million in the first quarter compared with $339 million a year ago and $270 million in the fourth quarter. We expect this revenue to decline throughout 2013 and essentially be gone by the end of this year. Also, in comparing the Other segment's revenue with the year ago, please note that quarter included about $65 million in business interruption insurance proceeds associated with the earthquake in Japan.
Turning to distribution, resales [ph]  grew 1% from a year ago and declined 3% from the prior quarter. Distributors were able to further reduce their inventory levels as they continued to rely more heavily upon our consignment program. Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit of $1.37 million was 47.6% of revenue, down 10% from a year ago and down 5% sequentially. The decline from a year ago was mostly due to lower revenue. The included -- this included business interruption insurance proceeds in the year-ago quarter that fell through strongly to gross profit in that quarter. Sequentially, lower gross profit mostly reflected lower revenue.
Operating expenses of $878 million were 10% lower than a year ago, mostly due to cost reductions associated with our legacy wireless product lines, as well as synergies associated with our National acquisition. Sequentially, operating expenses increased 3%, which was mostly tied to seasonal factors such as compensation-related expenses that were primarily offset by savings associated with our Wireless restructuring.
Net income in the first quarter was $362 million or $0.32 per share, and includes a $65 million discrete tax benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, which was retroactive to the beginning of 2012. We had previously described this credit as part of our guidance for the quarter.
I'll point out that, as we have eliminated our Wireless segment, a higher portion of the expenses associated with our corporate activities are being allocated to the remaining segments. We are fully on track to achieve the cost reductions that we described in November with our Wireless restructuring actions, and these gains can be readily observed at the company level. However, profitability in the other segments has been impacted as they now shoulder more of the allocated expense. You will see this in both the comparisons with the year-ago quarter as well as the prior quarter.
Let me now comment on our capital management, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $360 million in the quarter. We lowered our inventory by $57 million in the quarter. Inventory days declined to 101 days from 103 days last quarter. We're a little below our long-term targeted range of 105 to 115 days that we communicated in February. However, inventory days will likely rise for the remainder of this year as the Wireless revenue and its associated inventory, which turns at a faster pace, winds down. Capital expenditures were $84 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $276 million.
Given the noise that is inherent in quarterly cash flow and its components, it is useful to look at this on a trailing 12-month basis to understand our longer-term trends and progress. On this basis, cash flow from operations was $3.32 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Trailing 12 months capital expenditures were $476 million, down 34% from a year ago. And free cash flow was more than $2.85 billion, up 16% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 23% of revenue for the trailing 12-month period, within our expected range of 20% to 25% of revenue. In the year-ago quarter, trailing 12-month period free cash flow was 18% of revenue.
I should note that our capital expenditures for the past 12 months were 4% of revenue. We are operating at the low end of our model, and we believe we can remain at this low level of spending for several years, given our strong capacity position that has been built as a result of our strategic investments of the past few years. The cash flow that will result as we fill up this capacity should be strong in the years ahead.
And as we said, strong cash flow, particularly free cash flow, means that we can continue to provide strong cash returns to our shareholders. In the first quarter, TI paid $232 million in dividends and repurchased $679 million of our stock. For the past 12 months, we have paid $856 million in dividends or 30% of our free cash flow. Similarly, we have repurchased $2.18 billion of our stock or 77% of free cash flow. In total, we've returned 107% of free cash flow over the past 12 months.
As we explained in February, our capital management strategy is to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders except for what is needed to repay debt. Fundamental to this strategy are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter with $3.86 billion of cash and short-term investments, with 84% of that amount owned by TI's U.S. entities. This means our assets are productive, and our cash, because it is largely onshore, is readily available by the corporation for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock.
TI orders grew sequentially, and our book-to-bill ratio was above 1 as our backlog expanded. Customers continue to keep the amount of backlog they have in our books constrained, however. Demand has been rising but we've been executing well to support it, despite not having a lot of extended visibility.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.93 billion to $3.17 billion in the second quarter. And at the middle of this range, revenue would increase about 6% sequentially, despite about a 30% expected decline in revenue from our legacy wireless products. As for the rest of our revenue, that would result in growth of about 8.5%, at the middle of our range, a level that is generally consistent with the seasonal average for our second quarter.
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.45. For the year, our estimated -- for R&D expense has been reduced to $1.5 billion, down from our prior estimate of $1.6 billion and compared with $1.9 billion in 2012. Most of the reductions from 2012 are a result of our Wireless restructuring activity. Our estimate for capital expenditures remains $500 million, well below our depreciation estimate of $900 million. Our estimated effective tax rate remains at 22%.
So in summary, we continue to be encouraged by our strategic progress. TI is now clearly an Analog and Embedded Processing company. We serve a diverse set of customers and end markets, which means we have the opportunity for long-term sustainable growth with less volatility than in our past. The small amount of legacy wireless revenue that remains is quickly winding down. The combination of our rich product portfolio and ample manufacturing capacity has us well positioned for growth in the years ahead. And that growth should continue to drive good cash generation, $0.20 to $0.25 of free cash flow for every $1 of revenue, and we fully intend to continue to return this to you, our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Amber, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions]
"
2013-04-22,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Kevin, I guess for you. As we think about the allocation of OpEx to the Analog and Embedded business as you're moving away from Wireless, one, is it sort of going along as you thought it would in Q1? And what's the pattern we should expect to see in terms of Analog and Embedded profitability as we go through the rest of year?
Kevin P. March
Glen, the allocation that you're talking about is the -- I think you're talking about the allocation of the corporate expenses.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Right.
Kevin P. March
And again, just to repeat what I've mentioned a moment ago, because we now have less cost going forward, that corporate cost will allocate to fewer segments. But the burden by those remaining segments will be up. The cost of the corporate activities doesn't scale one for one with the cost of the actual business operations. And consequently, while that will come down a little bit, it won't come down near to the magnitude that the inherent cost will come down as we wind down the Wireless segment. But the result of the allocated cost to remaining segments will be higher. And you can see that incrementally, if you look at the segments that we just published. And on a go-forward basis, those allocated costs will come down a little bit over time, but not significantly. The result is though, as we see revenue growth going on inside the segment, we should see the profitably of the segments continue to improve.
Ron Slaymaker
But as Wireless winds down from here, Kevin, will those allocated costs increase further to Analog and Embedded or are they basically at the run rate for the year?
Kevin P. March
They're pretty close to the run rate for the year that they're going to be at.
Ron Slaymaker
All right. Glen, do you have a follow-on?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I do. We've had some of your peers talk about growth in the June quarter and basically suggest things are growing, but maybe not growing at a stellar rate. I wonder if you can talk about your order linearity in the quarter, how you -- how that progressed, and maybe your view on sort of the steepness or shallowness, as it were, of the cycle that we're in.
Ron Slaymaker
Glen, I guess -- I'm afraid I don't have a lot further to add than what's inherent in the guidance. So, other than the decline in legacy wireless, we're expecting a seasonal second quarter for the remainder of our revenue. The microanalysis of the quarter and linearity of revenue or linearity of orders, frankly, there's nothing really to be gained there. And what I mean by that is we had a typical first quarter profile on both orders and revenue. We declined around Chinese New Year as we do every year and then it's recovered and bounced back again in the month of March. But nothing really unique in the first quarter profile compared with what we would typically expect in a first quarter. Okay, Glen, thanks for your questions.

We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
What are you guys planning on doing with the factory loadings in Q2 and any thoughts on the factory loadings at this point for the back half?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Jim, as it relates to loadings, with the increased outlook that we have, we would expect the factory loadings to be higher in 2Q than they were in 1Q. And consequently, utilization charges will, in all likelihood, decline quarter-over-quarter. I expect that the utilization, which was about $150 million of underutilization charge in the first quarter, which was down about $20 million from the fourth quarter, will decline further as we go into second quarter on the back of increased factory loadings.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on question, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Sure. And I know you guys have kind of taken to using the trend line analysis to think about the industry and underscore that, even though we don't know exactly when things are going to recover, it's just a way to highlight how much we're undershipping sort of what a long-term level is. I think the kind of conventional bear case on that is a, long-term demand is broken now, and that trend line, that a lot of us using, including you guys, isn't relevant anymore. So what do you say to folks when they say that long-term trend line is broken and therefore, that analysis isn't relevant?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, recently -- we're trying to avoid that discussion. And what I mean by that is we have no unique insight to provide in terms of where we are with respect to that trend line, where we are with respect to the cycle. And so frankly, we're just heads down focusing on trying to gain share in Analog and Embedded Processing regardless of the market environment, and be able to generate free cash flow at the 20% to 25% of revenue level that we described. But we'll leave it to you experts to try to figure out where we are relative to those trends and relative to any cycle considerations.
Okay, Jim, thank you for your questions.

We'll go next to Christopher Danely, JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First question is just on -- another one on order trends. So it seems like after this quarter, the Wireless part of your baseband [ph]  probably be pretty much de minimis. So if we just continue in the sort of normal seasonal slog, can you just remind us what Q3 normal seasonality is? And will there be or could there be any more depression on your overall sales from Wireless in Q3?
Ron Slaymaker
I think -- well, Chris, I mean, we're saying so in second quarter. We're saying that the Wireless, legacy Wireless, will decline to roughly about $150 million compared with $210 million in first quarter. So there's still $150 million to unwind through the remainder of the year. So the answer is yes, it will likely continue to be a bit of a headwind, but I think we've quantified it. It gets smaller and smaller as every quarter passes by, which means the end is near on that. In terms of third quarter, our historical average is about 5%, and again, I'll put the same caveat on it we always do, there's a wide range about that 5-year average. In our case, it's minus 2% to plus 18% so -- but the average is, in fact, 5%. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Sure. Can you just give us your expectations on the relative growth rates for either your main product lines or end markets for the rest of the year? Or at least give us the status of those?
Kevin P. March
Chris, I would just say that we would expect that, at least for our segments, we're likely to grow at least at the market rate. And because we have been pretty successful at consistently gaining market share for the last 4 or 5 years in each of our target segments of Analog and Embedded Processing, I would expect that we should be able to turn in maybe growth a little bit beyond what the total market itself grows. Beyond that, as Ron mentioned a moment ago, we're probably a little bit hesitant to go off and articulate that we had some kind of expertise or special insight as to the market growth or the economy as a whole. Instead, we remain focused on really growing share and converting that revenue growth into free cash flow. We've targeted 20% to 25%. We just turned in 23% for the last 12 months, and that was in a pretty weak market. So with that in mind, we're pretty encouraged as to what this portfolio can do for our shareholders going forward.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Chris, thank you for questions.

We'll go next to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I guess, Kevin, as that Wireless legacy business goes to 0, what would you expect the profitably to be in the other bucket? Is the intent to try to get that to breakeven as revenue goes away, or how should I think about that?
Kevin P. March
John, I would think that, that would be profitable. Because as that Wireless goes to 0, on its way down, it's probably delivering pretty much no profit, because we're taking out cost at about the same rate that the gross profit dollars are coming out. But keep in mind, what else is in there. We have our DLP technologies in there, we have our custom ASIC in there, we have our calculator business in there and we have our royalties in there. And each of those are relatively low R&D, relatively low SG&A type of businesses, so they generate reasonably high margins and attractive cash. So the only thing that will be dragging it down on a go-forward basis, recall that we also take -- we put the acquisition-related charges into that segment, which will run around $85 million a quarter. And we also put restructuring charges into that segment, which this past quarter was about $13 million, and should run about that same level for the next couple of quarters.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, John?
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes, quickly as a follow-on, just 2 housekeeping. Did you give an absolute bookings number? And you spent about $680 million buying back stock in the quarter, but share count was kind of flat sequentially. Can you just help me understand, was that just stock price driving more options in the money and dilution, or was there something else going on?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. John, on the bookings, orders were $2.96 billion in the quarter. That was up 9% sequentially and that resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of -- Kevin already said it was positive, but it was 1.03, and that compares to 0.91 in the fourth quarter. Let me add an additional note maybe or asterisk to the book-to-bill. Keep in mind that we now have 45% of our total revenue on consignment. So consignment, by definition, runs a 1.0 book-to-bill. So for the additional 55% of our revenue that's not on consignment, for the total to net out to 1.03, obviously the non-consignment revenue ran well above that 1.03 book-to-bill. So obviously, we have a book-to-bill that's fully supportive of the revenue we have forecast for the next quarter. Kevin, you want to handle the back part of the question?
Kevin P. March
Yes, John, on the question of the stock count relatively flat this quarter, and in the face of the fact that we've repurchased $679 million worth of shares, there are really 2 things going on there. With the increase in stock price and just the natural pending expiration of certain stock options, there was an increase in stock option exercise across the employee base and that, of course, put shares back into the market. At the same time, that stock price increased the dilutive share count. So those 2 elements combined basically held the share count about even in the first quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, John, thanks for your questions.

We'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Had a question on the trajectory of OpEx. So your new R&D guide replies something exiting the year at a run rate of maybe $340 million, $350 million. Is that accurate? Can you give us some idea of, I guess, what the trajectory of OpEx through the year looks like, and how sustainable that run rate exiting the year is going to be going forward? Do you expect that to grow as revenues grow?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Stacy, so just to help everybody else get to that similar conclusion there. We guided R&D to $1.5 billion. We just spent about $420 million, $419 million this past quarter. So you can kind of get to what the balance of the quarters look like. I would point out that, on the Wireless restructuring, we mentioned that we're well on our way to the $450 million in annualized savings. And the best way to see that is probably to take a look at TI -- at third quarter and kind of compare that with where we're at today. And you can see the effect on the R&D line as we begin to unwind the Wireless segment. We're probably about halfway through -- more than halfway through the savings and the R&D as it relates to the Wireless restructuring. And so that will keep on going. And so the kind of math that you're using when you get to year end, from a seasonal basis, probably isn't too far off from what we might expect by the time we get there. And clearly, we'll have such things as pay and benefit increases and so on, on a year-over-year basis and we'll bump that back up as we move into 2014, but I don't expect that to be all that much in relation to the total cost savings that we have. A similar phenomenon on SG&A is likely to occur, although not nearly at the same magnitude. Clearly, the biggest spend in the Wireless restructuring was in the R&D cost category.
Ron Slaymaker
Stacy, do you have a follow-on?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I do. I wanted to poke into the Embedded Processing margins a bit. So I get the idea that you're allocating more corporate cost around the -- around the other businesses. In this case, so you also lumped in, I guess, the Wireless Embedded? And I just wanted to clarify, I think your plan is have that business at a roughly breakeven OpEx level right now for the Wireless piece. Can you give us -- number one, is that accurate? If it's not, can you tell us what that, I guess, the OpEx burden of that business looks like? And finally, how big does Embedded Processing actually need to get now before you can start driving margins, I guess, at historical levels in that business? Are we -- are you finished increasing the investment levels there? Do we have all we need?
Kevin P. March
Stacy, I'll go ahead and answer that. And if I miss something, maybe Ron can speak up also. What we talked about was that the Embedded Processing technologies of OMAP and Connectivity, when -- we've operated at about breakeven. Keep in mind that the portion that we move from Wireless will be added to a portion, the OMAP portion, that was already serving the Embedded space, in the form of the automotive markets that was already inside the Embedded Processing segment. So when we look at those and combine those, they are at about breakeven on a combined basis. I won't go into details as to what their OpEx levels are, but just suffice it to say that they're at about breakeven on a combined basis. On a go-forward basis, to your question as to what should we expect from Embedded Processing, I would characterize the level of -- the level of investment inside that segment today to no longer require additions of the level that we've been doing in the past couple of years. We are at a point now where we are spending at sufficient levels to invest in product development. And now, it's all about growing the revenue to begin to absorb the costs that are already inside that segment. So at this point, and as you saw in this past quarter, that segment did grow. And it's grown not only on a quarter-over-quarter but year-over-year basis. And so I would expect that we would continue to see some good things out of that segment.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you, Stacy, for your questions.

We'll go next to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Just wanted to follow-up on the trajectory of the OpEx cuts. I mean, should we think about it fairly linear on the R&D side? And then can you just remind us what the target is on the SG&A? You said you thought you could bring it down a little bit, but it -- does it still get back to where your target is?
Kevin P. March
Blayne, I'm not sure what you're talking about on targets per se. I would say that, broadly speaking, we have talked about OpEx, as a collective cost category, to fluctuate between 20% and 30% of our revenues. From where, on a weak cycle, which we're just coming out of right now, we would expect that to be at the upper end of that range, pushing the 30% level. And in fact, in first quarter it was exactly that. It was 30% of our revenues. As our revenue strengthen, we would expect that OpEx to work its way down as a percentage of revenue. And in a strong market, get down to the 20% kind of range. On a go-forward basis, there is still cost to come out, as I mentioned a few moments ago, especially out of the R&D line. Do recall that when we talked about the cost savings that we expected from the Wireless restructuring, $450 million annualized by the end of the year, roughly 75% of that is going to come out of R&D, roughly 15% of that will come out of SG&A and the balance would come out of cost to revenue. So we would expect to see a little bit more lift out of the SG&A as we get later in the year. And largely, this is a timing of the action, certain of our sights around the world that will affect when we see those benefits begin to come through the P&L.
Ron Slaymaker
Right. And I would just add that if you compare where we were in first quarter with R&D compared with third quarter of last year, before we initiated the Wireless restructuring, you'll see that we are well ahead of linearity in terms of the reduction. That being said, probably, linear assumptions from now through the rest of the -- over the next 3 quarters, is probably about the best you could do. The end result likely won't be fully linear, but that's probably about as good as we could get. And I should say we're still -- there is some work we're doing with the Works Council in Europe that could affect the timing of the activity. So there is certainly some uncertainty there just in terms of the exact profile. But we're well on track to achieve the savings, and we'll get the remainder out. Just whether it's linear or sooner or low -- or slower, we'll leave to -- report it as it happens. Do you have a follow-on, Blayne?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division
So then just on the drop-through of gross margin in the June guidance, it seems like a little bit below your target. Is that just calculators, or if you can just talk about the different moving pieces on gross margin?
Kevin P. March
Blayne, I'm not sure what you're saying, a little bit below our target. We did talk about that during -- through the course of the cycle, we would expect fall-through -- delta revenue to fall through the GPM would be 75% through the course of the cycle, based upon our historical experience.   In fact, we've got pretty good fall-through happening right now, if you do the math on 1Q revenue we just turned in. And we just said, up on the midpoint of the guidance that we just gave, I think we got some pretty reasonable fall-through on that. And in fact, if you take a look at it, it actually makes quite a bit of sense in the context of 2 things. Really, we've got mix improvements as Wireless is coming out, and so Analog and Embedded Processing become a larger portion of our revenue. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, we've got the benefit of the fact that our factory loadings will be up on expectations of higher revenue in second quarter. And so that will have a favorable benefit to our utilization charges.
Ron Slaymaker
So Blayne, just -- I would just -- we don't get down to those individual lines. But in terms of your model, charges in second quarter will probably be pretty similar to where they were in the first quarter. Most of the acquisition charge line is the amortization of acquisitions, and will pretty -- will stay pretty stable for a period of time. The restructuring, as we continue our work to close those 2 older factories, the one in Houston, the one in Hiji, Japan, which will take through probably -- or the second facility will close in second half of that, of this year. So we probably have a couple more quarters where the restructuring charge will be similar to what you saw in first quarter. And so I think if you take that, if you've taken -- if you add to it to the guidance we provided on R&D, you should find your growth -- your incremental margin will be very similar to what we described as the historical level or above. So I think as you continue to scrub that, you'll probably get a refined answer. All right. Blayne, thank you.

We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Great. I wonder if you can give us -- and within the Analog business, just some end market color on computing, wireless infrastructure, auto, industrial. Did any market particularly stand out either in Q1 or in terms of the 2Q guidance?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, I certainly can do that, but I'll have to do it for TI overall. I don't give those inputs collected by segment, but I'll make these segment discussions maybe as we go through. So industrial, which affects both Embedded Processing as well as Analog, and we noted specifically Analog SVA, as well as High Performance Analog, we're seeing strength mostly driven by the U.S. and China. Europe and Japan, both continue to be subdued there. I'd have to say it's like everything else, the customers are operating more or less hand-to-mouth. They're not giving a lot of extended visibility, but demand there, overall, is clearly rising. Also as we noted, we're seeing strength in automotive. Most of that is being driven by the U.S. market. Probably the weakest on that front would be in Japan. And then I think for the year, we would expect to see China start to build on the strength for TI as well. When we look in the computing market, specifically, we continue to see weakness in the PC market. And that's really being driven, we believe, by -- likely by additional cannibalization of tablets and smartphones. So we'll see where that goes, but that market remains weak. Consumer, I would describe as mixed. Areas like gaming are weak. TV sales, I would say, overall remain weak, but vary by OEM, with the Japanese OEMs probably the ones that are giving up the most in terms of market share. In handsets or mobile communications, I think even as we talked about in the mid-quarter update, first quarter, we saw, overall, I'd say a little stronger than what we had expected there. But that varies pretty significantly by OEM. So overall, did a little better for us, but not uniformly across customers. And that goes across, again, a lot of different products, both the legacy, but it's also some of the products in Analog that we sell into the handset space. And then finally, comms infrastructure remains weak for us in first quarter. That's along the lines of what we described in the mid-quarter update. And that really just is continuing to be driven by constrained operator spending. We don't believe there's an inventory. We think inventory -- I'm sorry, we don't believe there's an inventory issue. We believe inventories in that space generally remain low, but operators just have not picked up their spending. So I guess if I were to summarize, at least as it applies to first quarter, we saw the PC area and we saw the comms infrastructure area both below our expectations coming into the quarter and what we would  describe or characterize as weak. On the flip side, industrial was strong, better than we had expected. Automotive was strong, better than we had expected. And then some of the mobile handset markets also were. Okay, Joe, thank you, and we'll move to your second question.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Sure. And then within the Wireless segment, the stuff that, for you, is discontinued, it was a bit stronger than we thought, both in Q1 and Q2. I wonder if you could address, could that tail be longer in the back half? Or is there sort of a pretty finite life for the next generation of those products comes in and you have a steeper decline?
Ron Slaymaker
We believe that we will have that product line wrapped up by the end of the year. So we have not changed our expectations from the standpoint of the endpoint there. So obviously, there's always some puts and takes there. But it's -- we still expect, by the end of the year, that revenue will essentially be gone. Okay, Joe, thanks for your questions.
Operator
We'll move next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Kevin, one more question on OpEx. Let me try it a different way. If my model is right, in the last 10 years, I think your SG&A has been consistently below your R&D expense. And when I compare you to more of the pure-play Analogs, ADI, Linear, they're SG&A expense is 20% to 30% below their R&D expense. So I understand that there are some near-term issues you have to take care of, but what will be the trigger for you to lower SG&A below the $1.5 billion R&D expense, as your model becomes closer to what we would think of as a pure-play analog embedded supplier?
Kevin P. March
I think that to look at our history probably isn't a really good predictor, because our history has a big chunk of wireless in it for an extended period of time with a substantial R&D build. So I would offer to you that, that would distort any historical analysis of TI, as a starting point. Beyond that, I think perhaps the biggest thing that's going to be different between TI and other Analog and Embedded Processing players, or potentially different, is the fact that we had made a conscious decision, and we made it a number of years ago, to have a significantly larger sales force than any of our competitors. And that's really on the back of the fact that we have a significantly larger catalog of products than any of our competitors and therefore, there's a lot more to be sold. And the result of that, of course, as we have seen, has been that we have actually been able to achieve market share from our competitors over the last few years, on the back of a larger portfolio of products and a larger sales force. So all that being said, to say that there is no intent to go off and do some kind of significant readjustment to the size of our SG&A bucket. In fact, it's a conscious effort on our part to make sure that we have the world's largest sales force. There will be some costs coming out of the SG&A as we wind down the last of the Wireless sites, specifically the one in Europe that Ron was talking about earlier, and that's subject to finalizing our discussions with the Works Council in Europe. Once that's complete, we would expect that the SG&A to support that site would come out of our costs and take our SG&A levels down a little bit, but I don't think it will achieve the kind of ratio that you are alluding to there.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes, Ron. So second question is on gross margins and capacity utilization. As your mix starts to improve, are you still comfortable with the 75% fall-through to gross margin? What are the puts and takes in that? And when you acquired all the capacity, I understand the cash costs a little bit, but when you acquired all that capacity, global growth expectations already different than what they are right now. So what kind of checks do you have in place to make sure that you are able to utilize all the capacity so it doesn't become a drag on margins in some reasonable period of time, the next, whatever, 2, 3, 4 years?
Kevin P. March
Well, I think I counted maybe a couple questions in there, so let me see if I can remember them all. On the fall-through, we remain comfortable with what we talked about, only by virtue of the fact that, that's what our history has shown us. And that is, through the course of the cycle, up and down, we average 75% fall-through on the delta revenue. Interestingly enough, in any one quarter, you practically never see that 75% fall-through. But across the cycle, you'll see that. And we don't see any reason why the future would be different than what history has shown us for a number of cycles. So I wouldn't expect that to change, in light of the fact that we'll begin to increase our utilization. As to how much capacity are we comfortable with, once again, the utilization charges that we talk about here, in fact, a lot of that is noncash. We've talked for several quarters in a row now, that it's probably half or less is going to be cash related and the rest is noncash. And cash is extremely important because obviously, that results in free cash flow for our shareholders, which I believe when we talk to them, most of them say it's quite important in the context of us being able to provide them with dividends and ongoing stock buybacks. So we will remain focused on the benefit of the free cash flow that this strategy employs for us, as opposed to trying to make adjustments solely for the benefit of a GPM percent calculation, that may or may not benefit free cash flow going forward. So with that being said, there are no plans, other than what we've already announced, for changing the size of our installed manufacturing capacity. And those plans that we've already announced, well the ones we announced 1.5 years ago, and that is the closure of an old small factory that we have in Hiji, Japan, and the closure of an old factory that we have in Houston, both of which will be closed in the second half of this year or by the second half of this year.
Ron Slaymaker
And Vivek, interestingly, when we talk to our large shareholders, which most of which are very long-term in their investment horizon, they describe the idea of buying capacity on the cheap for pennies on the dollar and holding it, even if it's a number of years until we need it, as a no-brainer. And in fact, I think that reflects their own investment style with stock. So again, we feel like we are very well aligned with our largest shareholders in terms of that strategy, and we think we'll continue to deliver good returns with that strategy. Okay, Vivek, thank you for your questions.

We'll go next to Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
On the underutilization charges that you mentioned, Kevin, I think it was -- you said $150 million in this last quarter. Any way to give us a clue on what revenue level those underutilization charges will disappear? And I fully realize that it's more about utilization than revenues. But just to simplify it, any answer on that front will be helpful.
Kevin P. March
I can't give you a specific number on that because it's a mix of the optimal loadings in all the various factories that we have around the world. And we have more than 20 factories around the world, so I don't have a precise answer for you. But I think a 50,000-foot way of thinking about it, is that we have characterized that we believe that we have enough installed capacity to support something approaching $18 billion of revenue. And so in theory, if we went to 100% utilization on that, we clearly do not have an underutilization charge at that revenue level. In fact, underutilization charges never assume that you get to 100% utilization. They assume that you get to something less than that. And again, that varies by factory, and I don't have a precise answer for you on that, Ross.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Nice try, Ross. Do you have a follow-on question?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, maybe I'll get a little closer with this one. Similar to the prior question on when is SG&A going to go down, actually if I flip that around, I look at your peer group, the R&D as a percentage of sales for most of your analog peers is significantly higher than where it seems you guys are going to be exiting this year. Again, I know you have the Other segment that you don't have to utilize as much, but do you think you can keep the share gains going at whatever pace they have been, with R&D as a percentage of sales being so much below your peer group?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Ross, I'd be cautious on the analysis that you're doing. Because of course, with the segments we reveal only the revenue and the operating profit or PFO. In fact, when you're trying to do your R&D analysis, you're doing it at the company level. And I'd remind you that the comments I made earlier on the call, the level of R&D that we spend in the Other segment is very, very low. And so, in fact, the proportion that's being spent in Analog and EP is probably a little higher mathematically than what you're getting, just like at the company level. In the meantime, again, we have over 100,000 products, we sell them to over 100,000 customers. We actually think that we have plenty of opportunity to continue selling those products -- even more of those products to the same customers, as well as new products to the same customers or new customers. So we're not worried about the R&D spend being able to give us expansion to our portfolio. We're quite confident with where we're at.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes. And, Ross, I would just add that, keep in mind, the reductions that we're doing are, as a result, almost wholly due to the Wireless restructuring, not Analog, not Embedded Processing. And so going forward, we're probably spending at comparable levels in those 2 segments, the Analog and Embedded Processing, than we have in past. And you've seen our results in the past translating to market share gains. So I don't think there's any issue with our spending level, with our portfolio expansion. I'll just give an example, in Embedded Processing, we took the number of products that we have in our portfolio up by 20%. I think that's a reasonably significant expansion in a single year and reflects what's a pretty aggressive R&D spend there. Okay, Ross. I believe that was your follow-up question.

We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montréal.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Ron, you did go through the end market breakdown. I just had a question. I'm trying to reconcile the industrial strength that you saw, and you seem to be seeing, with we've had a couple of big and harbingers of that market, GE, as well as, this morning, Caterpillar, come out and sort of have a very cautionary tone. So in your opinion and looking back, is that kind of factored in with the inventory being low and so you continue to see that market strengthening? Or does it take a longer time for that to filter through the order book?
Ron Slaymaker
Ambrish, I don't know that I can correlate what we're seeing to what those 2 guys are describing. I mean, frankly, we don't sell a lot of semiconductors to Caterpillar. And I don't mean to diminish that they may be reflecting something that's going on at a broader macro level, but a lot of what we're seeing in industrial is almost the same type of trend that you see in automobiles. Automobile unit sales can be flat, and we still have a really nice growth opportunity because of the rapid penetration, increased penetration of semiconductors in those markets. When you go into other industrial markets like lighting, and the rapid escalation of LED lighting versus CFL or incandescent, I can tell you, we have a much higher semiconductor content in LED lighting than we do in the prior generations. And that's just an example. I mean you can go across smart thermostats compared to the old electromechanical, you can just find one after the other, where we're now selling significant semiconductor content into those industrial markets, where historically, we sold very little. So I'm not giving up hope that we're going to turn Caterpillar into a huge customer someday. But again, not here and now today. So we're -- things can always change, but we're pretty confident in terms of what we are seeing with our own business. Do you have a follow-on?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Yes, I do. And I hope you can sell a lot more content into those GE turbines [ph] as well. My follow-up is on SVA. Last quarter, it kind of went in line with the TI core Analog and this quarter, it's up. Could you please just give us some qualitative measure, or quantitative, as to how SVA is performing? And I know it's early in the turnaround, but just also where are you with the consignment that SVA is going through?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. There's a couple things to say about SVA. One, I think the last couple of quarters have been very encouraging in terms of just the relative performance of SVA compared to the rest of our Analog business. It has been, compared to the other 3 businesses that we have, it's right at the top over the 2 periods. Now those are only 2 quarters out of a year, but keep in mind, our expectations for a year or 2, was that SVA moves up to market level growth, meaning we don't lose market share through those businesses, but we expect that it would probably lag the remainder of our Analog businesses, where they have been gaining share historically. So really good results for the last 2 quarters, still a lot of work to be done. We're not putting a fork in it yet, but it's feeling really good thus far. Status of consignment is, I think as we described back in third quarter, we expect -- we had a total of $100 million, basically, to convert over to consignment. We've done about 1/3 of that in each of the last 2 quarters, so we're about 2/3 of the way through. And our expectation is that, for the remaining 1/3, it will probably take 2 more quarters to get through that consignment changeover completely. So 2/3 of the way through, 1/3 to go over the next 2 quarters. Okay, Ambrish. Thank you.
Operator
We'll go to Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes. The first question, I know you don't talk about linearity, but can you at least talk a little bit about what the puts and takes are for your guidance range?
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, not really, Tore. I mean, there are so many variables, any one of which that can affect whether things are going up or down. But suffice to say, it's hard enough to get the total right without trying to go public on all of the individual assumptions. So obviously, we look at it at that detail level, but in terms of our public guidance and comments, we'll just keep it at the total. Okay. You have a follow-on question? That was pretty easy.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes. No, thanks. This is for Kevin. You're guiding for CapEx to be $500 million. I think you just spent $83 million. So should we model that pretty steep increase in the second half? And if so, what's that for?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Tore, we're holding to $500 million on the CapEx forecast. And we expect that probably most of that will be for wafer fab equipment, with -- I'm sorry, [ph]  for assembly test operations with the balance for wafer fab equipment. And that's really just a question of making sure that we've got enough capacity for the volumes that we're actually producing. Keep in mind that, at level there, there's a little bit of capacity expansion but to a large extent, it's line rebalancing and just making sure that things are -- as the demand on certain flows change, we can rebalance the line to handle those demands. I'm comfortable that we will remain inside that CapEx forecast this year at $500 million.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Tore, thank you. And I think at this point, we'll give you back a minute of your time. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Thank you. That does conclude our conference. You may now disconnect.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Texas Instruments First Quarter 2013 Mid-Quarter Update Conference. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the first quarter of 2013. In a moment, I'll provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company.
In general, I will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segment or end markets, and I will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information.
As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings to the upper half of our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $2.80 billion and $2.91 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.28 and $0.32 on a GAAP basis. As in our original guidance, EPS still includes about $0.06 of acquisition and restructuring charges and about $0.06 from a discrete tax benefit that is resulting from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit that was retroactive to the beginning of 2012.
Since the net impact from the acquisition and restructuring charges and the discreet tax benefit is essentially 0, EPS on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis should be the same this quarter. Looking ahead, the vast majority of our ongoing acquisition charges, or about $80 million per quarter, will be from amortization of intangibles, an amount that will remain consistent for the next 7 years or so. We also expect that restructuring charges will remain low from here.
In consideration of this, we recommend that those of you that submit estimates to organizations that compile consensus estimates, such as First Call or FactSet, should now transition over to GAAP submissions only. While the non-GAAP estimates were beneficial over the past 6 quarters to help out [ph] investors understand the underlying trends of our business operations without the noise of acquisition and restructuring charges, we believe they will be unnecessary going forward. Of course, we will continue to provide full transparency for you into these expenses as they will continue to be reported as separate lines on our income statement.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
"
2013-03-07,Q&A," Session
Operator
We'll take our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Ron, I had a -- I wanted to dig into the order trajectory a little bit. On your last earnings call, you had said that, I guess, orders had bottomed in December, and January, on a sequential basis, was looking better. Could you give us some feeling how that trend is -- has it moved through February and even through the little bit we've seen in March so far?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Sure, Stacy. Let me just say, in general, the stronger demand environment that we discussed back in January has continued through the quarter and, overall, is tracking better than our initial expectation. So we see this in our revenue trends and even more so in our orders, as we are now building backlog for the first time in several quarters. So I would just say, quarter-to-date, orders have been growing strongly and turns levels have been high as we're able to support our customers with short lead times. And also, our good inventory position clearly is contributing to that. So as I noted, we're building backlog. I would note that given the high turns, visibility remains low, but we have no reason to believe that the strength we've seen thus far will not continue as we go forward. Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I do. If you could give us a little bit of color on where the strength is coming from, or at least areas that might be stronger or weaker versus your initial expectations?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, sure. And this will probably apply to both about orders and revenues, but I specifically was looking at revenue when I came up with these. But I would say, the strength is most notable in the industrial market. And as you'll note, that's where we have a strong presence with Analog products, specifically our High Performance Analog and our Silicon Valley Analog businesses. On the flip side, we see continued weakness in some of the vertical markets, such as notebook computers and communications infrastructure. I'll also note that handsets and tablets are up overall compared with our initial expectations. But I'd also note that results there really vary by customer. Thank you, Stacy.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Ron, Just a follow-up to the last answer you gave. On that handset and tablet commentary, do you still -- does your guidance still encompass a $135 million sequential drop in your Wireless business?
Ron Slaymaker
Ross, that's a good question that -- I guess, what I would say is, we expect our Wireless revenue still to decline sharply this quarter, although Wireless has seen some strengthening, as well as these other areas that I just noted. So the decline would be less than the $135 million that we called out in our January call, but I don't have a specific updated number for you at this point. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, just on the OpEx side of things in a general sense. I know you talked about $450 million in savings from exiting the Wireless business. How should we think in general about the slope of that reduction, as well as how the core OpEx within TI is likely to trend relative to revenues going forward?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So just as a reminder, what we said back in November I guess when we announced that Wireless restructuring, we noted that we would expect $450 million of savings by the end of 2013. I can't say that will move exactly linear, but I don't have a specific profile for you either. What I would say is that we also have the revenue and the associated profit with that revenue declining sharply as well. So I guess what I would say is, the net effect of it all, by the end of the year, the loss that our Wireless business was incurring, we would expect it will be essentially offset via that -- both the wind-down of revenue as well as the restructuring cost savings. But I don't have a quarter-by-quarter breakout for you. Okay. Ross, thank you.
Operator
Chris Danely with JPMorgan has our next question.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Ron, can you just remind us what normal seasonality is for Q2? And just a quick clarification, so are you saying that your book to bill is above 1 so far this quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Normal seasonality in second quarter is about -- is upper single digits, clearly. So probably 8%, 9%, something in that general range. And that -- I would just remind you that it's a sequentially -- or seasonally strong quarter for both our semiconductor chip shipments, as well as for our calculator business. Our calculator business alone typically will contribute 2 to 3 points of company-level sequential growth just with its -- what often is a doubling of its revenue between the first quarter and the second quarter. So again, seasonally, second quarter is our strongest. I don't have a specific forecast for you. We'll provide that in April. But we're clearly expecting growth in the second quarter ahead. To your question on book to bill, I guess I would again just reiterate, orders that we've seen are strong. I think I've said we're building backlog for the first time in several quarters. So I guess, by definition, if we're building backlog, then that implies the book to bill is above 1. And we'll have a specific number for you as usual in April. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes, just between the 2 areas of strength, I guess, if we take industrial versus handsets/tablets. Are either of those contributing more strength or more upside in terms of revenue? Or are they both about the same?
Ron Slaymaker
They're not both the same, but I really don't want to get into, at this point, trying to break out the differences there. I'll say both industrial and the handset/tablet space are up. But we'll give more detail in April. Okay, Chris. Thank you.
Operator
And Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
In terms of the better demand, do you guys have a sense of how much of that is just an end-market improvement versus some inventory restocking on the part of the customers from the low [ph] levels?
Ron Slaymaker
We don't, Jim. And what I would say is it tends to be -- as I said before, the orders that we're seeing is a lot of kind of in-quarter turns type activity. So our sense is that the customers are still running pretty lean on the inventory front. They're not committing to a lot of extended backlog. Our lead times, the vast majority of products are under 6 weeks. We're delivering well to that schedule, and customers are leaning on us accordingly. So again, my -- so I guess I would -- that would -- the end result of that would be yes, it's reflecting in-demand as opposed to inventory build. But as you're aware, it's really difficult for us to say with much precision exactly what's going on other than kind of the high-level turns activity to me would reflect probably more in-demand as opposed to -- or at least preparation for a higher level of in-demand. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, please. If I could, on the factory utilization. Anything you could quantify from us? We've heard from some of your sort of tangential competitors about what kind of increases in factory utilization they might be seeing. So anything you could maybe tell us about Q1 or plans about factory loading setting into Q2 to help us think about margin leverage, that'd be great.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Jim, I would say that, in fact, we have increased production starts this quarter to support the higher level of anticipated demand we have for the second quarter. The only thing you have to be cautious about when you try to translate that to a gross margin impact is that there is some lag time. Because again, we can start an extra wafer, and that won't necessarily impact utilization all through the lines. But over the course of time, as we continue to increase production starts, that lifts utilization. So just with that caveat. Okay, Jim, thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
I apologize for the background noise. Just one question on the -- first on the overall in-demand environment. And just please help us contrast with past head fakes versus past sustainable recoveries. So what can you point to us and say, okay, this looks a little more sustainable than the head fake that we had last year?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I think -- I don't know that we can perfectly. I think -- again, what we are encouraged by is when we look through our distribution channels and we look at customers, we generally see lean levels of inventory and, therefore, a pretty quick read-through from changes in in-demand to our own -- or demand for our own products. But as you pointed out before, sometimes, these things happen, and it translates to a full-blown cycle. In other cases, it's a head fake, as you've described. So I can't provide perfect certainty other than again, we're preparing in terms of our factory utilization, in terms of our inventory position to support a growing demand environment. Do you have a follow-on Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Yes, Ron, and that is helpful. And the follow-up is on the comp [ph] side. So Xilinx and [indiscernible] were more bullish about the comps [ph] than in the turnings. What have you guys seen specifically when you say that you continue to see weakness?
Ron Slaymaker
It's what we're not seeing, which is not increased demand from that segment of the market. And again, the FPGA players tend to play much more concentrated at the very leading edge of wireless infrastructure equipment. We play there also, but we also play much more broadly than they do. So I don't know that I can sit there and compare and contrast and explain what they're saying versus what we're seeing. However, we are confident in our design-in position across the range of base station equipment. We have not yet seen it lift. It could potentially even be differences in lead time for those players versus TI. Again, our lead times generally are short. We've heard through our customer base, and this is not necessarily a communications infrastructure-specific note, but we've heard more broadly through our customer base that several of our customers are in the process of extending lead times. We are not in the position where we have to do that. But of course, that could reflect in just timing of when certain competitors or certain other suppliers might see increased demand versus when we might see it. We'll all see it in the end.
Operator
And Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division
With the better strength in Analog, are all your segments still down? And then maybe you could just comment on the computing segment, whether you see a build -- how we should look at the seasonality? Obviously, new platforms are coming in the back half. Are you seeing the channel clean? And when will we see -- start a seasonal build there?
Ron Slaymaker
So, Blayne, the -- let me ask for a clarification. What was your question on the seasonal builds for -- was it specific to an end market?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Computing.
Ron Slaymaker
Computing. Okay.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Are all segments still down with the strength in Analog? And then could you comment on the computing end channel? That seems to be solely accretive [ph].
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, computing. I thought you said competing. Okay. So Analog, Embedded Processing and Other, all 3 of those segments we expect to be down. As we described somewhat in January, we're in the process of aligning [ph] our segment, financial segment reporting structure to our new organization. The Wireless segment has been eliminated, and the legacy wireless products will be included in the Other segment, and that is the biggest factor in the Other segment's sequential decline. We'll get more information for you on the various segments and some of their historical trends probably within the next couple of weeks, as we noted back in January. But Analog will be down. Embedded Processing, we would expect will be down slightly. And then Other will be down. So again, consistent with our initial expectations in the quarter. However, all 3 of those would be down less than what we had expected back in January. Did you have a follow-on, Blayne? The question on when we expect computing to be lifting, I can say that we would have expected stronger from computing already. So computing is actually running weaker than we had expected back in January, as is the communications infrastructure. Do you have a follow-on question, Blayne?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Yes, just in the strength you're seeing in wireless. It seems like your customer there has new platforms you're on, and I'm assuming that's where a lot of the strength is coming from. How does that -- you've talked about Wireless kind of fading for you by the end of the year. With this customer continue to build on your products, how do you see the trajectory with your connectivity products?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. It's not a customer. It's still a breadth of customers that we're engaged with in Wireless. And it's different -- as I've said before, different results from different customers. We do expect it to continue down. Just as I said, it's down sharply, even in first quarter, not -- it's just not down as much as we had expected. And a lot of that sequential decline from fourth to first, part of it is tied to the wind-down of those product lines, part of it is just the seasonal trends within those customers. So I guess I'll just leave it at that. Okay, Blayne, thank you.
Operator
Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Ron, back in January, Kevin said that the utilization charge  would be about the same in Q1 versus Q4. Does that still hold now with the nice improvement you've seen in bookings?
Ron Slaymaker
We probably have taken our production starts up a little more than what we had expected back in January, and you could see some impact. But in general, Kevin's statement still holds, which is that the underutilization charge in fourth quarter roughly would be about the same as what we would expect in first quarter, maybe a small improvement from that. Okay, Tore, do you have a follow-on?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes. So on the distribution channel, obviously, if industrial is driving the strength, I assume DSPs are doing quite well for you. I was just hoping you could qualitatively talk a little bit about what they're seeing especially in relation to their sell-through on your product.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Yes. So distribution sales -- or resales from distributors, or their sell-through, will decline about the same as our revenue overall. So they're tracking pretty closely with TI. From an inventory standpoint, interestingly, distribution inventory that's owned by those distributors will decline. But that really is just a function of them relying more heavily on consignment inventory from TI. When we look at the combination of what they own and what we have in place for them on consignment, inventory is at about the same level as it was at the end of the year. But again, what they own, what they have on their balance sheet will actually go down this quarter, which says that is a successful program.
Operator
Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
One question I had for you was the industrial piece of the business seems to be pretty strong. Is it fair to assume that as your -- as the benefit of higher production starts come through gross margins in second quarter that the incremental fall-through is higher than the 75% typically that you talk about versus average cycles in the past?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I think, over the course of the cycle, that 75% is the right number. And whether it happens in any particular quarter or not has a lot of different factors, including the amount utilization charge or the less or more charge. Whether your cycle's going up or down, that falls through. So in this case, I don't know that I would -- I think 75% is still a good general number to use quarter by quarter, but it will always varies somewhat. And I think it also could just be the effect being delayed by a quarter in terms of the underutilization impact versus, did it go away? Or is it higher or lower in a particular quarter? But Sumit, we'll give you some more specific guidance on second quarter once we get into April. Do you have a follow-on?
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
Just a quick housekeeping item. Can you update us on exactly what percentage of business is industrial today?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes. Hang on just a second. Let me pull out the -- pull that up for you. I thought I had it here. Okay. So industrial is right at just below 20%, 17%. Sometimes -- and let me just be clear, because different people look at different things in terms of what they include in industrial. So the very, call it, broad-based type of industrial is 17%. Separately, and not included in that 17%, is automotive, which is 11% of our revenue. And then education, which is our calculator products, runs about 3%. So -- but what I believe you would typically consider industrial, I would call 17%, with automotive 11% above and beyond that amount. Okay. Thanks for your questions.
Operator
We'll continue on to David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
This slightly, better-than-expected strength that you're seeing. Is this a constant high level? Or are you actually seeing momentum grow, that -- each week, each month is a little bit better than the last, leading to the upside?
Ron Slaymaker
David, it varies somewhat because keep in mind, we had Chinese New Year in the month of February. And so we had a very strong January. February fell back a little bit, as you would expect for Chinese New Year. And then as we moved through that, it came back very strong again. So it's doing -- it's not this nice, smooth profile where you can look at the second derivative and say it's X or Y. But it is doing what you would expect in terms of a, what I'll call an improving market environment. But you have to allow that Chinese New Year within there as well. Do you have a follow-on, David?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes, a quick one. And the upside, is it both in terms of your sales related to distribution, as well as the sales that are going directly to end customers and manufacturers? Or is it more weighted to one or the other?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, it's both. That being said, industrial tends to move heavily through distribution. So clearly, that channel is an important one for us right now with the industrial exposure. But as I said, the handset space is running better than expected as well. And a lot of that business -- not all, but a lot of that business tends to be direct. Okay. Thank you, David.
Operator
And Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Unknown Analyst
This is Josh Shanker [ph] on behalf of Tim, and I have a question on the rates guidance. I just want to understand, is this a function of overall TI's end market? Or is it that every other semi company is seeing this kind of uplift? Or is it because you guys have guided a little bit more conservative than peers, and you are increasing your guidance?
Ron Slaymaker
I think, as I've indicated, industrial is a big part of the strengthening environment. I don't know is -- if somebody else guided more aggressively versus TI, then they may not see as much lift as we're seeing versus those expectations. But I think, given the broad base of the industrial markets, anybody that's a player in that space is going to see an improving environment. And again, just -- at an absolute level, forget guidance, whether it was conservative or aggressive. I think that environment is showing very clear signs of improvement. Do you have a follow-on question?
Unknown Analyst
Yes. So on the industrial market, so if you look at the [indiscernible] data, the overall -- the Analog ASP has come down over the past 6 to 8 quarters, and it seems like mostly it's due to the weakness in industrial. And do you see -- I mean, I know the industrial has picked [ph] up in Q1, but do you see that continuing on over the rest of the year?
Ron Slaymaker
I think I've indicated we expect growth to continue into Q2. I've probably stuck my neck out far enough with that forecast. We'll talk about Q3 and Q4 as we get closer to those quarters. So I don't really have any specific comments or forecasts for that. Okay. Thanks for your questions.
And let me just say, before we end the call, let me remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you, and good evening.
Operator
Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for your participation.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl
Thank you, Mara. Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call and allowing us to share our capital management strategy with you. Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today to provide details and to answer your questions. For any of you who missed yesterday's release announcing our latest dividend increase, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.
This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. From the website, you'll be able to see our presentation, or if you wish, you can download it from there as well. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the press release published yesterday, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Over the past few years, TI has undergone a strategic transformation. The consistent direction of that transformation was a focus on better opportunities and markets, namely Analog and Embedded Processing. These continue to be some of the best opportunities inside of semiconductors, offering compelling financial characteristics, growth, diversity and stability. They also offer the best exposure to the growing opportunities inside of the industrial and automotive markets. At this point, our most difficult strategic actions are complete, and we now have a company with more than 70% of our revenue coming from Analog and Embedded Processing. As a result, our business model consistently generates cash, and the sustainability of this business model gives us confidence in our ability to return more of that cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and additional share buybacks.
Consistent with this belief, we announced last night that we're increasing our dividend to an annualized rate of $1.12 or a dividend yield of 3.4% as of yesterday's close. This 33% in our dividend follows a 24% increase announced last September and marks our 10th consecutive year of increases.
As well, we announced that our Board has authorized us to repurchase an additional $5 billion of shares, bringing the total outstanding authorization to $8.4 billion. Our share repurchases have resulted in a 36% decrease in our shares outstanding since the end of 2004. Our track record of increasing dividends and our continual share repurchases demonstrate a foundation and consistency of returns to our shareholders.
Further, the combination of generating and returning sustainable cash to our shareholders puts TI in a unique class of companies, especially when compared to other technology companies.
We appreciate your time today to allow us to provide you a full look at our capital management strategy. With that as a backdrop, let me turn it over to Kevin and he can share the details.
Kevin P. March
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everybody. Let me just begin by mentioning that we are pleased that after many years of very hard work, TI's transition to an Analog and Embedded Processing company is essentially complete. And as Dave mentioned, more than 70% of our revenues last year came from Analog and Embedded Processing. And with the legacy Wireless products nearing their wind down on the near-term horizon, the growth of our Analog and Embedded Processing portfolios will soon be able to shine through, benefiting both our top and bottom lines.
The transition to Analog and Embedded Processing, we believe, puts TI into a uniquely strong class of growing companies that generate and return cash to their shareholders. This business model enables TI to consistently convert 20% to 25% of our revenue to free cash flow. And importantly, we are employing a capital management strategy designed to return 100% of our free cash flow less dividend -- less debt repayments to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We believe that TI's capital management strategy will continue to enhance our competitiveness and maximize our shareholder returns.
Let me just take a moment to take a look at a few of the key advantages that TI enjoys that allow us to deliver on this capital management strategy. Right on the top of the list, quite frankly, is a very high margin portfolio that we enjoy as a result of our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing semiconductor technologies. Second on the list is that we employ a tax strategy that repatriates cash back to the U.S. rather than leaving it stranded overseas. The result is we have ample cash to use for our U.S. operations, and importantly, to return to our shareholders. Because we have a strong balance sheet and we maintain certain obligations as fully funded, such as our pension obligations, we maximize our access to low-cost debt. This results in the ability to leverage our balance sheet when economics makes sense or when strategic opportunities present themselves.
And finally, as a result of our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing technologies, we enjoy the benefit of very long-lived manufacturing assets further enhanced by active use purchase -- used equipment purchase from over the last few years, which translates into our expectation for low capital expenditures for quite a few years to come.
The combination of these advantages results in a couple of very important outcomes and enables our capital management strategy. First and foremost for the company, it allows us to convert 20% to 25% of our revenue into free cash flow. And importantly for investors, it allows us to commit to 100% of our free cash flow, less debt repayment, to be returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.
I think it's instructive to note where our advantages place us in the S&P 500, and this chart illustrates it quite clearly. Arguably, we're in pretty good company in that we're in the 80th percentile, or put it another way, the top 20% of free cash flow generators in the S&P 500. Other names that are in our neighborhood are pretty respectable companies also, Capital One, Bristol-Myers, Pfizer and Apple, just to name a few. And we expect the business model that we now have put in place to keep us low ranked in the S&P 500 for many years to come.
Our capital management strategy, and I think it's most nicely summed up by this particular graphic. To put it quite simply, we have a great business model because of our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing semiconductors. We employ an effective tax strategy, which brings our cash home to the U.S., making our cash available. That results in a strong balance sheet that allows us to keep our pension funds well-funded, and thereby, maximizes our access to debt when the economics makes sense.
This in turn allows us to deploy this cash to continue to invest for our competitive advantage over time, which includes investments in our technology capabilities, our manufacturing capacity, our working capital and acquisitions. And because we will be generating more cash than we need, it also allows us to return cash in the form of dividends and buybacks and periodic debt repayment.
There are several elements to a comprehensive capital management strategy, and I'll use the next few slides to discuss what our ideas are on these. First and foremost is cash availability. To put it quite simply, where your cash is has a meaningful impact on what you can do with it. We believe the most responsible thing to do is to repatriate our cash, albeit at the lowest possible tax rates, so they can be reinvested in our businesses and returned to our shareholders. As we look out into the future and anticipate future tax rates, we assume the continuation of the current tax laws. And when you do that, off of our current 22% tax rate, we're estimating that when our revenues reach about $15 billion, we'll probably experience about 25% tax rate. And when our revenues reach $18 billion, we'll probably experience something like a 28% tax rate.
After making your cash available, then the question is how much cash do you hold. Obviously, this is a somewhat subjective calculation and reasonable people can arrive at different conclusions. But that being said, we employ policies whereby we expect to maintain sufficient cash on hand to meet our operational needs and pay our expected dividends and debt. This policy is designed to allow us to manage through a wide range of scenarios and be able to fulfill our commitments on dividends and debt obligations. Because of the design of our global footprint, we expect that we can keep more than 80% of our cash onshore, though our model is to average over time about 10% of our trailing 12 month revenue plus our next 12 months dividends and expected debt repayments. Our status at the end of 2012 was that 83% of our cash was onshore, and our total cash on hand was consistent with our model.
Turning to our pension strategy, we watch this closely because globally, it's a large commitment for us and it has a direct bearing on our debt capacity. So our strategy quite simply put is to maintain our pension plans fully funded on a tax sufficient U.S. GAAP basis to minimize any risk of overfunding, and to the extent that we do invest cash into those trust funds, to invest the assets in those trust funds on an asset and liability matching principle. Our status at the year-end 2012 was that globally, our pension plans were 95% funded. So our expectation for future cash requirements are minimal for this obligation.
Turning to our debt strategy, I'll remind you that our current debt is about $5.6 billion payable through 2019. The coupons on those debt issues range from 0.45% to 2.375% for TI-issued debt, and 3.95% to 6.6% for the debt we assumed for the National acquisition. We expect long-term debt will continue to be a part of our capital structure when borrowing economics makes sense. I'll note that we believe our high rating of A1A+ provides comfort to our debt and equity owners as to our ability and commitment to fulfill our payment obligations. So in light of that, we do not expect our debt balances to negatively impact our credit ratings. We'll consider rolling over our debt when interest rates are less than the expected inflation rate or dividend yield. Also, we expect that if we do roll over, maturities in any 1 year would not exceed $1 billion in order to minimize any future rollover risk.
To facilitate our access to debt, we intend to maintain a current shelf registration, which is helpful because it enables a short lead time if you choose to raise capital and includes the debt markets. In addition, we also intend to keep our long-term credit lines and diverse set of high-quality banks. Our status, again, as of the end of the year, is our current debt is at already capacity, our shelf registration is current and we presently have a 5-year $2 billion credit revolver with a very high quality set of banks.
Turning to investments to maintain our competitive advantage, our strategy here is really quite simple. And that is to extend the competitive lead that we already have with our differentiated Analog processes and our 300-millimeter in-house manufacturing capability. Our capital expenditures for technology development will be focused on differentiated Analog process flows and specialized packaging techniques, as well as differentiated embedded memory flows down to 90 nanometers.
Our capital expenditures for manufacturing capacity, in this case, our model is to maintain our wafer fab capacity at a tooled basis, a minimum of 3 years ahead of what we expect demand to be, and clean room for up to 5 years ahead, with a special focus on opportunistically equipping our 300-millimeter Analog fab, especially where distressed pricing opportunities materialize.
On the assembly test side, we expect to remain tools capacity at least 18 months ahead of demand with open space in our assembly test sites at least 3 years ahead of demand. And we expect to continue to use foundries for all of our CMOS production below -- for 49 nanometer and below, and on selected analog and packaging overflow demands.
Our capital expenditure journey has actually been a long one, dropping from levels exceeding 20% of revenue coming out of the '90s to the low double digits by the middle of this last decade, where we now expect to operate in the 4% range through $18 billion and a 47% range thereafter. And unlike in the past, where our capital expenditures occurred much closer to when we needed the capacity, which subjected us to full-priced equipment, we now acquire our capital well before we need it, opportunistically capturing far lower prices, thereby further lowering our cash needed for capacity expansion in the future.
Turning to working capital, it's really quite simple here, it is to stage inventory to maintain very high levels of customer service. Obviously, that's starting to be competitive with our peers. In addition to this we continue to be very disciplined with how we manage our accounts receivable and our accounts payable. Our inventory model is to have between 105 and 115 days of inventory. As of the end of fourth quarter, we had 103 days. You might note, if you look over the past year, our peers have operated in the 90- to 130-day range. So this model puts us right in the center of where our peer group operates.
Finally, on acquisitions, it will continue to be biased towards Analog and smaller acquisitions that bring us attractive products and/or talented engineers or improve our position in attractive growth markets. As has been the case for a while, the financial test for acquisitions for us is that the return on invested capital from the acquisition must be accretive to our -- with the average cost to capital within 4 years in order to be affordable.
Returning cash to our shareholders is nothing new for us, we've actually been doing it for many, many years now. In fact, over the past 5 years, we have generated and return, 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders or about $12.5 billion. What is new is voicing our commitment to continue to return 100% of our free cash flow less debt repayment. And we can do this because we are now at a point where our business model not only strengthens our ability to achieve that kind of commitment, but to sustain this commitment over time.
Over the last 8 or 9 years, we have actually reduced our total shares outstanding by 36% through a disciplined practice of steady stock repurchases. Going forward, you can expect more of the same, that is repurchasing steadily on our discounted cash flow value of the company, exceeds the market stock price for our shares. Our target allocation for stock buyback is total free cash flow less the amount that we use for dividends and debt repayment. As of yesterday's authorization of $5 billion, that brings our total authorization today that's available for future buybacks to $8.4 billion, as Dave mentioned. Over that same 9 years, we have also consistently increased our dividends, as you can see from this chart. With yesterday's announcement, our new dividends annualized rate is $1.12, which represents about 43% of what our 2012 free cash flow was. At yesterday's stock price, that's a yield of about 3.4%. Our formula for dividend is to target about 50% of our trailing 4 years average free cash flow to be used for dividends. With yesterday's announcement, TI has increased its dividend in each of the last 10 years now.
Again, looking at how we are persistent in the S&P 500 with our dividend yield, we're already well positioned in the 69th percentile previous to this increase. But with the new increase, it puts us in the 84th percentile, actually quite consistent with where we rank on a free cash flow basis.
So really just to summarize, our transition to an Analog and Embedded Processing company is -- quite simply results in a much stronger free cash flow business model. The combination of a higher-margin portfolio and a sensible tax strategy means that we have cash available for strategic uses and to return to our shareholders. Our access to low-cost debt in the upkeep of obligations mean that we have a balance sheet that's not only strong, but easily available to be leveraged when the opportunity presents itself. The long-lived assets and long-staged equipment purchases that our model enables means that our capital expenditures going forward will remain to be low as we've seen in the past year. We believe this puts us in a unique class of strong generators and returners of cash. To reiterate, we believe that we will be able to convert 20% to 25% of our revenue into free cash flow as a result of a product portfolio that has been and will continue to grow. You can expect that 100% of our free cash flow, less debt repayment, will be returned to shareholders. And I will just close by saying that the increases in the dividends and the share buybacks that were announced yesterday reflect management's confidence in our business model, and importantly, our commitment to shareholder returns. So with that, let me turn it back over to Dave.
David Pahl

[Operator Instructions] We go to our first caller, Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
That was very detailed and comprehensive. One question, and then I have a follow-up as well, please. When we -- Kevin, you mentioned that -- you were talking about the business model has transitioned, and you look forward to the Embedded and the Analog now shining through. So the first part, we know that the transition has happened. What gives you the confidence about the shining through part? Is it based on the organic TI business getting design wins or National doing better? So just please help us understand that part, and I had a quick follow-up.
Kevin P. March
Sure. I think it's the combination of the 2. Organically, we have been growing and gaining market share now for a number of years. And that's quite apparent when you just look at the market available data. In addition, we have the additional leverage from the Silicon Valley Analog or the National acquisition. Recall that when we talked about the acquisition, we expected during the first year that they would -- that, that business unit would probably continue to lose share as it had been doing prior to when we acquired them. During the second year, which we're now into, they would stabilize from a share standpoint. And then by the third year, we'd expect it to start gaining share, consistent with the other Analog divisions that we operate. And so combined, we look at that and expect that's going to continue to gain share for us going forward, which means even if the market growth rate is unpredictable, our ability to grow inside that market is fully in our control. Similar in Embedded Processing, you may recall that we stepped up our investments in Embedded Processing, especially on engineering and our sales on field staffing about 2 years ago now. And it takes several years for those types of step-up in investments to begin to yield results, and we would expect to see that business begin to -- it has been growing nicely and gaining share, but we expect to see it continue to grow quite nicely and gain shares and move forward.
David Pahl
Do you have a follow-up, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Yes, Dave. My follow-up on the buyback, should we be thinking about the level that you guys have been doing the last 2 years? And then also what kind of stock level do you feel your stock is undervalued?
Kevin P. March
Well, let me start with the first one. We, obviously, have been actively buying our shares for a long time now. I mean as you saw from that chart, we reduced our share count by 36% since 2004. The amount that we will allocate to stock buyback is really, the formula is clearly pretty straightforward. We take a look at our prior 4 years free cash flow, the average free cash flow. We will allocate half of that free cash flow for dividends. We'll use the balance for paying down debt as it comes due and buying back shares. So I think that the kind of stock buyback activity you've seen us do here recently is probably pretty reflective of what we can expect going forward. As to the valuation question, I would simply say that we believe that the valuation opportunity for TI is substantially above what it currently is as our strategy unfolds in the next few years.
Operator
And we move now to Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Kevin, just following up on your last statement. Can you provide us the parameters you use in calculating the DCF that you talked about on Slide 14?
Kevin P. March
Glen, it's pretty classic business school calculation in that we look at the current value of the company as it relates to our asset base and our free cash flow generation capability over time, and we discount that back at our weighted average cost to capital.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. Nothing unique there then. The other question I had, Kevin, was you talked about, in the CMOS process, you're going to outsource below 45-nanometer, but Analog, and I obviously recognize that Analog is not at that node, but do you anticipate Analog will eventually get below 45? And if it does, is that something you intend to do in-house? And then related to that, you also mentioned that you want to have a certain amount of tools installed ahead of demand. Is that dependent on the availability of cheap tools? You've always been very good at buying tools from bankrupt companies. Or are you willing to buy new tools if you need to?
Kevin P. March
On the tool question, I'll answer that one. I'll let Dave take a poke at the -- on the other part of your question. On the tool question, Glen, we're looking there -- quite frankly, when you buy it before you need it, you actually don't have to pay full price, whether that's a relatively new tool or a used tool. And that's quite simply the essence of the strategy here, is to purchase it when you don't need it, and you can wait until the price is attractive. Clearly, we'd prefer to buy the tools when they're distressed, when certain competitors in the industry find it necessary to get rid of those tools, that's the most attractive pricing opportunity. But again, our strategy is to buy well before we need it so we're not subjected to, if you will, the catalog price at the time we do need it. Dave, do you want to comment on the [indiscernible] question?
David Pahl
Yes, Glen, if you look, our total number or percentage of wafers that are outsourced today is around 20%. And again, that's 45 nanometers and below that's 100% outsourced for advanced CMOS. And as our Wireless business unwinds, obviously, that percentage will decrease and the percentage that we build in-house will increase since essentially, all of the Wireless is built outside. And if you look at where Analog is today, there's actually a small portion of the wafers built at 180 nanometers. We have some newer process technologies at 130 nanometers. But most everything in Analog is 250 or above. And you just -- for most technologies and most applications, you just -- it's not a Moore's Law gain, and hence, one of the reasons why we can purchase more mature manufacturing assets and keep them employed for decades. So thanks, Glen, and we'll go to the next caller.
Operator
And we now take a next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I realize, Kevin, you have a mid-quarter update coming up soon, but can you give us your sense of what the state of the industry is right now? I think many of your peers have called for a bottom. But what I've seen is that over the last 2 years, it's been a relatively easy call to call a bottom in December, but then the visibility has tended to be limited after that. So I understand you want to be TI-specific, but how do you see the state of the industry? Do you see visibility improving, anything improving, or is it still very short-term focused right now?
Kevin P. March
We'll give more color in a couple weeks on our mid-quarter update as to what our current thinking is certainly in the near term, which I think is always on people's minds. But do recall that we had given a range that expected our revenue would probably decline slightly in the fourth -- first quarter versus the fourth quarter. And then seasonally, if you look, we typically see the industry, and TI included, seeing sequential growth in the second quarter. Right now, I don't see anything that I could comment on that would cause us to expect anything different than what history has taught us to expect, and we'll give more color on that a bit later when we get closer to that time.
David Pahl
Yes. And our mid-quarter update is scheduled for March 7, Vivek. So do you have a follow-up?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. Second, I think you mentioned that you are largely done with your restructuring actions. One question we hear very frequently from investors is what is TI's baseline earnings model, i.e., what is your target business model for growth and operating margins? So now that you're done with all the restructuring actions, how should we think about those particular metrics so we can start forming a long-term earnings model for TI?
Kevin P. March
Yes, I think the thing -- the way to think about this, Vivek, is consistent with our capital management strategy that we just articulated, and that is that we're focused on not just growing the top line, but generating and returning cash to our shareholders. So while our gross and operating margins by themselves are important metrics, they don't necessarily prove an enterprise's ability to actually generate free cash flow that can give return to shareholders. And other important factors that need to be considered also are the company's tax policy and the company's capital expenditure needs. And that being said, our mix continues to improve because Analog and Embedded Processing continue to become a bigger part of our revenues as Wireless declines. Combined, that should support all of these metrics improving and giving us better ability to generate cash for our shareholders. So again, I think the value that shareholders will find is not only the potential appreciation value of the stock price itself, if you will, but also the fact that we will continue to return our cash in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. I will just remind you that historically, we are in a growth phase, our incremental margins tend to fall through about 75% over the course of the cycle. So if that's -- hopefully, that's helpful to your question. Okay, we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We take our next question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Kevin, a lot of what you said was straightforward. If you look at your historic buyback and sort of the return on that buyback, it would appear that the core business generates a significantly higher return than the buyback. So I'm just kind of curious, why not have a greater focus on top line growth through M&A, especially given over the last 5 years, that core business has kind of had a negative CAGR. And I know it's been a hard industry, a difficult industry environment, but just can you help me understand why not more emphasis on top line growth?
Kevin P. March
Yes, John. I think we've got plenty of emphasis on top line growth, and I -- I take some issue with the core business having negative CAGR because, in fact, if you say total TI, that would be true when you work in the effect of the wind down of the Wireless business over the last 5 years. In fact, the organic areas that we've been investing in, those, in fact, have been growing quite nicely for multiple years now. To support that growth, you asked the question about acquisitions. Well, in fact, as you're all well aware, we just did a very large acquisition about 1.5 years ago. And frankly, those for us come along probably once every decade or so. To the extent that we will use acquisitions to continue to support our objectives in the future, I'd expect those are going to be pretty small acquisitions, certainly for the foreseeable future.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
And this is my follow-up, just the mix between buyback and dividend, especially a dividend of 50% over the last 4 years average free cash flow, anything magical about that target or what was the sort of the rationale behind that target?
Kevin P. March
Quite frankly, we think that it's a strong signal to our investors that you can expect a constant stream of income from TI in the form of dividends, and that at a 50% average free cash flow level over the last 4 years, that gives us ample headroom, if you will, to ensure that, that dividend would be uninterrupted. Because certainly, the other side of that program, it can be flexed if it needs to be.
David Pahl
Okay, thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll move now to Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Kenneth Lee
This is Ken Lee for Tim. Question on the capacity. You guys had talked about opportunistically acquiring capacity. Can you help me understand the rationale between at up to $18 billion in revenue, when you guys would acquire capacity and kind of just the rationale behind that? And I have a follow-up.
David Pahl
Yes, thanks, Ken. We've talked about before that we've got current installed capacity end-to-end, so both wafer fab capacity and assembly test capacity to support revenues up to $18 billion. And as you saw last year, we were able to put that capacity in place and yet, last year, spend less than 4% of our revenue line on CapEx. So as we look forward, and especially in areas like 300-millimeter tools, there are some of those tools that become available on the market fairly infrequently. So if the opportunity presents itself to acquire that equipment for pennies on the dollar like we have in the past, we want to take advantage of that opportunity and begin to extend that $18 billion from where it is today. And we expect to be able to do that, and actually, have made some acquisitions even here more recently and still do that inside of our current CapEx guidance, and therefore, continue to run at that 4% range for the foreseeable future. So do you have a follow-up?
Kenneth Lee
Yes. On the share repurchase, is there an expiration on that? And also, how do we think about the run rate in terms of repurchase? I know you guys had talked about in the near term, you guys are going to kind of be at the pace that you guys have been the last couple of quarters. What are the primers on whether you guys would accelerate that or decelerate that?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Ken, there is no time expiration on the repurchase. It's a budget that the Board allocates to management to deploy for these purposes. And so our present budget available is $8.4 billion. And as you noted, we have talked the share repurchase activity you've seen in the past few quarters. It's probably pretty representative of what you can expect going forward. So I think I'd probably just leave it at that. I don't expect a significant change one way or the other in the size of share repurchases for the foreseeable future.
Operator
Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I know you're talking about returning 100% of free cash flow less debt repayment, but it really does sound like you are prioritizing cash flow over that debt repayment. You've got about $1.5 billion in debt that's maturing in May. You have about $1 billion maturing every year kind of going forward. What is your thinking around, in particular that sort of short-term tranches coming due in a few months in terms of paying them? Should we expect that to be refinanced?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Stacy, certainly, at today's interest rates, it remains very attractive to be looking at rolling over the debt. You may recall that we initially took out the debt to acquire National Semiconductor. We had intended to pay the -- we paid the debt as it came due. And in fact, as we came into the middle of last year, we were seeing interest rates continue to be at historically low levels, and we decided that it made economic sense for us to go ahead and simply take on debt to capture those levels. And that's really a function of what we're talking about here. When it makes economic sense, we'll go ahead and roll over that debt to take advantage of these kinds of interest rates. And really the metric we're using is if we can capture interest rates that are even below expected inflation or below our dividend yield, then it seems like that's an attractive and accretive decision on behalf of our shareholders, and a safe decision on behalf of our bond holders, because we're quite capable of repaying it. So as long as we continue to see very attractive interest rates, you can probably expect that we will make some allocation to rollovers.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, just a question on the tax strategy. I just want to make sure I have the math right. So you're showing your sort of -- I guess this is your blended tax rate as a function of revenue. Is it just making the assumption that as revenues grow, you're repatriating more cash at 35%, and so the tax rate on this goes up? Are you doing something else around the tax strategy to minimize taxes?
Kevin P. March
No. There's a couple of elements that affect the tax strategy. For example, we enjoy a advance pricing agreement with the IRS that helps us to have a more predictable expectation as to intercompany pricing, and that's very important to your tax strategy and tax rate. And we just negotiated a 6-year deal with them recently. What that model really just assumes is that the incremental profit is taxed at the current statutory rate of 35%. And the current tax law remains in effect. Quite simply, I don't know how to forecast a change in the tax law. And so if you just tax each incremental dollar of profit at 35%, you fall through with those kinds of rates that you see in the sample model I gave.
David Pahl
Okay, thanks Stacy. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
And the next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
So this capital management process has been going on for a while, I mean the Analog business model has been obviously improving your cash flow every year. So I'm just wondering why now, why sort of communicate all this now? I mean is there more confidence in the business model? Is it because you're exiting OMAP? Just trying to understand the timing.
Kevin P. March
Well, it's a combination of those things, Tore. It's the fact that the Wireless is winding down and the cash call on that technology is going away. And it's the fact that we're now at more than 70% of our revenue's coming from Analog and Embedded Processing, which are much more stable and reliable generators of cash. And so we have reached that point in the transition of the company where we think it makes sense to go ahead and clearly articulate to our stockholders what our capital management strategy is, and the fact that they can count on us returning 100% of our free cash flow minus any debt repayment that we engage in going forward.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
That's very fair. And as a follow-up, when we talk about working capital and the inventory model being 105 to 115 days, I'm wondering if that will change once you move even more of your business to consignment or should we still assume that 105 to 115 days range?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Tore. That comprehends that move to consignment. Let me give a little bit more background on that. We ended last quarter at 103 days. Keep in mind, we're still winding down the legacy Wireless products, so obviously, we don't want any more inventory on those products that we absolutely need. We're also in the process of on our SVA product lines, as a result of bringing that division on to our IT systems in the fourth quarter, we've begun the process of migrating their products, their distribution-related inventory to our consignment model. So that 105 to 115 days comprehends this full transition, if you will. Over time, we would expect to probably be closer to that as we go into the future.

David Pahl
Okay, thank you, Tore. And next caller, please.

And the next caller is William Stein with SunTrust.

The one question that I have remaining is regarding your capital structure and the leverage. You have a little bit of debt outstanding. I think the consistency of your cash flow could, in fact, support a more levered balance sheet, and that would clearly be good for equity. I wonder what management's thoughts are on that?
Kevin P. March
Yes, it's a good question. It's a fine balance that we have here. Obviously, a company's ability to -- or their capacity for debt is somewhat a function of their credit rating. In our case, we have a credit rating of A1A+, which is a very strong credit rating. And we actually think that, that credit rating provides 2 very important care abouts to investors. That is it shows that we're a strong company that is committed to, and able to, pay its obligations. And those obligations would be interest and debt repayment to debt holders and dividend obligations to our stockholders. So while theoretically, it is possible to leverage the balance sheet more, it would be at the expense of lowering our credit rating. And we happen to think that with a company of our size and our global ambitions, this is the right balance and the right mix to be at this credit rating and to manage our debt inside that rate of capacity and not exceed that capacity. That's just simply the plan that we put together, and that's how we intend to operate.

And the next caller is David Schwartzman with Seix Investment Advisors.
David Schwartzman
I think you just answered my question. Earlier in the call, you had mentioned that you like paying your debt down because you then had the ability to flex your balance sheet. And I was going to ask was that all within the current ratings. And I think your answer was yes, but...
Kevin P. March
That's correct.
David Pahl
Okay. Well, we'll go ahead and conclude our call today. Thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available from our website. Good day.

Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Once again, we thank everyone for joining us.

Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate everyone being here this afternoon. I'm Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs and it's my pleasure to welcome Rich Templeton from Texas Instruments, Texas Instruments' long-standing CEO. Rich, thank you so much for being here with us this afternoon.
Richard K. Templeton
Great to be here.

2013-02-13,Q&A," Session
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, absolutely. I thought maybe we'd start off with some kind of big picture things and then kind of drill into some of the Texas Instruments specific things. But obviously one question on a lot of folks' mind that you being one of the biggest and broadest companies in the industry can bring some perspective to is kind of where your thoughts are on where we are in the semi cycle as we stand today, and then we'll kind of break it down from there.
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, Jim, I've had a chance for the past couple of weeks talked to investors, and I think you end up on almost 2 themes inside of that. First one we had [indiscernible] coming up. I think the January earnings call all felt about the same. I think companies used slightly different terms. But we all watched third and fourth quarter of '12 being down, but you watched December being better and even when we reported in January, we talked about January to that point being better. And then I go to kind of the second part of that thing is we've now gone 8 quarters, where after what some people would call a classic semiconductor cycle in late '08, early 2009 and then 6 strong quarters, we've been down 2, up 2, down 2, up 2, down 2, a pattern I haven't seen in all my years. And my modified view on that is starting to be it's not what have the past 2 years been like but that's much more what's it been like since 2007. And I think we just basically had somewhat a flat nondirectional macro economy. And yes, we have an over adjustment in early '09, and it reacted the other way, but then a indifferent kind of purposing of the demand since then. So as a result of that, people were like, ""Geez, is the semi cycle gone forever?"" I doubt it, humans are still humans. But the good news at TI is we're prepared however this thing wants to play out. So that's kind of where we see it right now and where things are.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And you mentioned during the January earnings call different companies kind of put some different wrappers around it but at the end of the day, there was a reasonably broad-based view that there was an improvement in December that continued into January and then some of the companies that have reported even in since February have said that, that's continued, and certainly we've heard that here at the conference. Different companies have cited different reasons for that. Some people have cited removal of the overhang on the macro, with the fiscal cliff issues at least being temporarily resolved. Other people have attributed it to a more traditional supply side driven pick up. Where do you come out on? What might be the possible causes of this early move we've seen off the bottom?
Richard K. Templeton
Jim, I'm -- and you've heard this from me many times when I get asked what's the best leading indicator of the market. Well, the best leading indicator of the market is orders.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes.
Richard K. Templeton
And people are like, ""No, it can't be that simple,"" well, it is. Because I actually believe when you start to look inside of that -- and Ron and Kevin described it on our call. If you look at third and fourth quarter, we saw a general breadth of decline, and it wasn't any one area. And I think you saw inventory decline. And I think we see right now is inventories are very low. You can look at that in some of the public company announcements the distributors and what they're carrying. And as a result, I'm going to guess you're going to have a combination of macro economy hangover less and people just being a lot lighter in terms of where their supply is. To me, what becomes interesting is okay, let's now wind this thing out another 5 and 6 months, and I think that is going to have more to do with does that macro economy want to keep staying constructive versus just where the semiconductor industry is. But low inventories have typically been a pretty good correlation though.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And one of the things that you guys have talked about in recent analyst meetings and presentations is that kind of concept of where we're shipping versus the long-term demand trends and the longer you ship below that trend, the more likely it is that we're going to see some improvement in the industry. I mean, as we hopefully get through the bottom of this and into a better stage, I mean, does that framework seem to make sense to you still?
Richard K. Templeton
Jim, I know you do the plot and you believe the plot and I do as well. And I say that just because we've got well over 20 years of history. And any way you cut it, that's the 7%, 8%, 9% unit growth curve take pricing out. And that's probably about twice the rate of the economic growth because we have more chips in our lives. I don't know if you've updated, but I've looked -- I think we're probably 8 quarters under trend, something in that range. You've done the work and that's longer under the trend than any time. That is not a prediction of a quarter that it gets better or any of that. But what we try to look at running the company is this world has gone back to that curve. And on behalf of our customers, we better be prepared that if it tries to, can we do that? And what I love about where we sit today is that I think, out of learning and out of experience, we are in a position to go back to that curve, when or if it wants to, and we're in a position to do that with very low capital spending. So we ended last year a little under 4%. We can easily get back on that curve and not dent the 4% number as well. That is a great place to be relative to the semiconductor industry.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I definitely want to get into some of the bold things that you've done in terms of adding capacity and things along those lines. But before we go there let's go back to the inventory for a second. You commented about how low it is. In your time looking at the industry, where do you think we stand relative to previous historical if we indeed have seen the trough, where are inventories today relative to previous trough?
Richard K. Templeton
Lower than ever, and the only thing I'm careful about on that is I think that this industry gets secularly better at how to operate with less inventory. You see it coming upstream, go do a plot of 10, 15 years of distributors' inventory that show up on their balance sheet. And it's a clear trend over time. And I'm actually okay with that. I don't mind that inventory being on our books because we can see it, we can manage it. We know how to do that pretty well. So it's down on a long-term basis, but this is even lower when you try to take a look at that curve. So you will have some ability for that to come back. But I don't believe you go back against 10 years of trend line. I think we do keep getting more efficient as an industry.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Now, I certainly am a believer in the trend line. You guys are believers in the trend line. When I talk to clients, one of the pushbacks we get is ""Listen, the trend line has changed."" And on one hand, we deal with that every cycle. Every time we're above or below the trend line, there's the argument that the trend line has changed. On the other hand, it's never really failed to predict over the long term what the cycles would look like. What would your argument be for the trend line not having changed?
Richard K. Templeton
The greatest thing is, I just look at innovation, and I look at, the simplest word to think of it is, number of chips in our lives. And while this world tends to be highly focused on smartphones and tablets, and they've been a wonderful business for us and a wonderful boom for technology and the base stations that support it, and all the things that I think can still happen. I also look over to broader markets like the industrial market that in many ways have depended on electro-mechanical solutions for the past 80, 90 years, and you see a level of innovation starting to take place out in those areas that when I count up the number of chips that are going to be in homes and around us, it's going up. Air-conditioners with wireless Connectivity and not because I want to program it but because the service office can tell when that compressor is wearing out and what part they'd have to bring out for a service call. You look at automotive applications and not only are the number of cars growing, but look at safety systems, driver assist systems, entertainment systems and you just see a broader set of categories than we've seen in a long time. And we, of course, love that because when you then look in some of the applications that I've just described, these things absolutely center up on Embedded Processing, analog and the components like that. And it's where we've got the company focused.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I think the temptation is for people to focus on the issues in PCs where you have very little exposure causing a declining slope of the overall trend line, but I think the view is that there's as much silicon content in the tablet that's cannibalizing the PC and you do have content there although that's a market that which we'll get into that you're de-emphasizing a little bit at least on the application processor aside.
Richard K. Templeton
No, I think those tend to get a lot of attention because they move the needle in their term, but I don't think they move that trend line when it's all done.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Okay. If we focus on the auto market for a second. This is something we've had in discussion in a lot of different sessions about. It's obviously something people have been talking about for a long time. Do you think the growth in silicon content in automotive is more about new features that we're all going to have in cars that we don't have even in the high-end cars today or is the silicon opportunity more about what we have in the high-end cars today go into the mainstream car because price declines?
Richard K. Templeton
It's really going to be a combination, and your guys will have the data, even more specific than I remember it. I think we're at 80 million, 85 million cars, trucks on a global basis this year. It's not too hard to find numbers of 110, 120 million units, 4, 5, 6 years out, which to me is accurate enough to have a sense of what the underlying volume curve of the chassis is, but to me where the real leverage is, is the content per car. And in the U.S., you tend to get very fascinated because you see a lot of high-end cars, a lot of European high-end cars coming in and you look at forward collision. And these are really great systems. I think they're going to improve safety. I think we're going to see that go across in many, many platforms. Entertainment systems, kids growing up with iPhones and iPods are not going to go backwards. They expect to be able to get their entertainment, their music the way they want it. And that's going to end up having an influence. But the thing that we see from spending a lot of time over in China is that this equipment doesn't remain just in high-end Mercedes or Audi. This is going down across a very broad set of cars. And as a result, I see that content story really around the world. So I think we've got opportunities on a global basis and not just high-end cars but really down to some entry-level vehicles picking up more and more electronics.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I wasn't going to ask this now but you just mentioned China and some of the improvement in the macro data in China is commensurate with this pick up that we've seen in semis. And frankly, in the middle of last year, some of the problems that we saw in the semiconductor sector coincided with some of the problems we saw in the macro data in general. How much of the recent improvement in semi activity you think is kind of directly attributable to the pickup we've seen in the industrial economy?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, I would -- Jim, I would really partition it. I think we all read the same thing of the general trend and the general mood and what the leading indicators are. We see it, you kind of sense it. But I'll go back to that kind of December, and January we're kind of seeing it across the board, and that's not a -- I want to just be very careful in the same spirit that Kevin and Ron were. It's not a go crazy number. It's just you see it happening in multiple locations. So I would not assign that or get too specific on that being just China.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Good, okay. I want to get back into some of the segments and see these [ph] opportunities in those segments later but before we do that yes, you've done a lot of bold things as CEO.
Richard K. Templeton
I hope you're right.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
We'll call them bold for now and then we'll just -- we'll go through that and see. You go back to getting out of the DRAM business, which obviously, was a terrific decision. You and I were talking a little bit beforehand about the decision to get out of CMOS development, and then you look at what CMOS development costs today and what companies have to spend to continue on that trend. And getting out of baseband even though you have the by far lion's share of the market. Now getting out of the OMAP and Connectivity business for smartphones and tablets. Buying a company that you acknowledged was losing share, and talking about that at the time you did the acquisition. Can you talk about some of those things, and you tend to do things ahead of time and they tend to be controversial and which ones of those do you feel obviously very good about retrospectively? And then how do you think, how would you mark yourself to market on the ones that were still ongoing?
Richard K. Templeton
Some ways I think the greatest thing that I've learned and it's kind of in the memory bank, and I think the team in general has is it really does pay to get to and focus on the best opportunities. And sometimes that can hurt in the short term, but I've never seen it not pay in the long term. It's that if you don't think the movie's going to end well, don't stick around, okay, because it's probably not if you've got that confidence. Memory was addition by subtraction back in the '90s and it was a great thing. I think it really helped accelerate us forward. I think some of the analog acquisitions we made back in 2000, and '99, they were great to really build us the franchise we have. To me CMOS back in '07 was a no-brainer, and it was a no-brainer not because of the cost that was going up but the differentiation that you could get was going down. And you couldn't get more speed and you couldn't get lower power, you couldn't get lower cost. Things were going in a different direction and so why have a business model built around something that can't provide that differentiation? I think we're going to turn around and find that the move on National was really a great one because just take a look at 40, 50 years of history in semiconductors. Good analog, good catalog analog, an industrial bias as you know, long-life products. And those applications generate great value, and we thought in National we had a great team of people, and we had a great set of products. And they just -- they could be directed better over the coming years, and we think we're on the path of being able to go do that. The capacity buildout that's back to a belief. This world usually has gone back to that growth curve around that demand level, and I've lived in worlds where we've spent $2 billion, $2.5 billion a year, and we've had to then deal with depreciation builds that went through the roof and that's just lousy work. And so this whole combination of having an analog and embedded business model where you get very long asset lives and then saying you know what, 300-millimeter makes sense but boy, it really makes sense when you can go buy it for deeply discounted original acquisition costs. Don't be afraid to go do it because that equipment is going to be used for 25, 30 years, and it'll pay back. And I think in many ways, we've now set ourselves up to have a tech company that can be one of the strongest generators of cash, but more importantly, a strong returner of cash, okay, because of things we've done on tax and some of those we can really connect those together and make it matter for investors on that front. So we've got a lot of work to still do to really get that translated. The good news is we've, you look back over the past 4 and 5 years, you see the reasonable indication of where we're going. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue has been growing from the upper teens into the low 20s. And I think we returned over 100% of free cash flow the past 4 or 5 years, and I think those are things we can keep doing on a sustainable basis, meaning we can be competitive. We can invest. We can be growing the business and yet do it with a very low capital build.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
You had the chance to buy more discounted 300-millimeter capacity today even though obviously we're in a down part of the cycle, and we're underutilized in that it is dragging down the short-term margins. Would you do another deal if it came up?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, and that's not a flip or a reckless casual comment. It's -- there was one rumor that you saw even a couple of weeks ago in terms of that and Kevin Ritchie and Kevin Marsh and our team sat down and take a really simple look of okay, what are the limiting equipments to build out our 300-millimeter facility at Renner RFAB, and okay, what's the smartest way to be able to go get that capacity online? And if you can get it at a low enough percent of original acquisition cost, it becomes really a no-brainer in terms of cash flow in terms of what you're going to do. So with all those rumors you saw a couple of weeks ago, it'll all fit well within any capital budget that we talked about for this year. I think we guided at $500 million, and it will be a very small piece of that. So to me, it remains good smart business.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
When you made the decision to get out of the wireless baseband business even though you have the leading share of the market, which obviously, in retrospect is certainly a great decision. You said at the time when people are pushing you about OMAP you said ""listen, one day, it will be commoditized and when it is, I'll get out of it. But until then I'm going to participate in the market, and it's a good cash flow generator."" Now we've reached the point where earlier -- late last year you guys announced for the smartphone and tablet market getting out of the OMAP and Connectivity business for that market in particular. Can you talk a little bit about that? And then can you talk a little bit about are there any other parts of the portfolio today that may be necessary to prune?
Richard K. Templeton
Jim, in some ways, I think we talked even at the May 2012 analyst meeting. I said, okay, we've got the OMAP and Connectivity business, we saw the P&L. I said trust me, they're not exempt from, they need to be good quality businesses. And the day that we don't believe they can, we'll do something different. And we announced that back in the fall. And I think in many ways, when you saw the, in some ways, concentration of the top 2 suppliers, but then looked at the vertical integration trend, to me, that all adds up. And by the way, it's not just the top 2 that have got their eyes on trying to do that when you look at some other suppliers around the world, that's a bad movie in terms of where that thing is going to end. And so if it's going to destroy capital, don't put more in it. So that's really the background on why you do that. I would have obviously loved for them to work, but at the same time, I think we've taken those assets, and I think there's some pretty intriguing things Greg Delagi and their team can go do. So that's how you've got to look through those things and not be afraid of making that call. If you then ask ""Okay, are there others?"" Maybe the better way to think about that is, I look at it as, are there other concentrated revenue positions? And if you think about where things stop becoming highly valuable is too much revenue per socket, attracting too many competitors per socket with not enough barriers potentially ends up as not a great business in the long term. And you look inside the portfolio, we're in pretty good shape today on that equation. Wireless was really the last of the places we had that. And in some ways, you see that with our customer diversity. I think we've talked about that at a couple of the meetings where, when we were big in baseband, I think Nokia was over 20% of revs. We've got our largest customer down single digits, and that's a good thing because I think it's indicative of diversity of strength and of breadth. So we've got some concentrated positions. You can look at things like common infrastructure, those are big markets, 4 or 5 customers. We do well with our multi-core DSP. So I think there's enough growth when you look at small cell and where that industry can go. I don't think we're going to have to deal with that for -- at least not for some time. You could argue we still have some things in the storage business, but you're starting to get down to very small percentages of overall company revenue. So I think more importantly, where our time is being spent right now is, ""Okay, let's look out over the next 5 years and let's make sure we're asking ourselves if the last 5 have been about building a great analog and embedded company, how can you now make that stronger?"" And so we start to look at how do you take the percent of portfolio that addresses industrial and automotive up? How do you take your revenue that's across a broader set of customers, meaning greater than 10 or greater than 100, how do you increase that percentage? And really building the portfolio in a very strong way on the -- for the out years. So that's where the strategic time is essential [ph].
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
From a practical investment standpoint, the investors who were here this week have a choice. In large-cap semis, there's really 2 choices. If we put QUALCOMM into another bucket because that winds up as part of a different benchmark in a lot of people's portfolios. The 2 large-cap choices that investors have are taking very, very different approaches to the market. You guys are not worried about what your top line growth is, and you're very focused on free cash flow generation and even if it means divesting businesses where you actually have an okay position. The other choice people have is a company that's pursuing growth but that's coming at the expense of near-term cash flow. How would you like investors to think about that?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. To me, the thing I'd modify only slightly is, growth is high, top line growth remains very high on our list. I think the asterisk is top line growth with quality positions, and I'm not trying to be cute. As you talked, right, we had some things we had to get cleaned up. And we've got OMAP and Connectivity will wind down pretty rapidly in 2013. You've now got 70% of the company focused on analog and embedded, and I think we're in a position to really grow those. We've been gaining share in both of those areas, you look over a 5, 6-year period on an incremental basis, and we'd like to keep doing that. And so I think growth is a critical element. Now that being said, I do think that you'll continue to hear us and continue to see us to be able to talk about the importance of free cash flow generation. And I say that in as much, and Jim, you've done some of this work, income statements are not always the best reflection of free cash flow. And that's just us saying, let's make sure we're paying attention to what really generates cash. Oh by the way, the nice thing is also to be able to return it. So that's where I get pretty excited about the product strategy, again, fitting together with the manufacturing, fitting together tax and down through that whole piece and what we can generate coming out the other end.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
You mentioned the returning cash to shareholders. I was going to save that until later, but you mentioned it now. And obviously, you guys have been extremely aggressive returning cash to shareholders. You talked about over periods of time greater than 100%. The philosophy going forward, obviously, you're going to continue to do that because that's part of the company's overall strategy. How do you balance it between future acquisitions, buybacks and dividends?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. I guess I'd separate it and first off, on acquisitions, I think you'll find us remaining on a bias towards analog. And then you can think inside of that, national is pretty instructive. We like catalog products, we like long life cycles, we like industrial, those are all good things when it comes to generating value, that's why we tend to favor that. And I say that, kind of as opposed to any acquisitions in embedded, because the financial dynamics of embedded are different. You want the most amount of software per instruction set, and buying things doesn't increase that leverage. It just gives you more instruction sets. So it'd be a bias on analog, and the other thing is that, it's got to not just meet those criteria, but it's got to be able to pay back. I think we're very clear when we announced National that this thing had to pay back in 3 to 4 years. And that tends to be a really important filter when you would look at that. So, and by the way, we're still pretty busy being able to grow National. So that's where our focus and attention is in the near term. If you look over the past, I don't know 4 or 5 years, as you said over 100% of our free cash flow back, I think 70% of it has been via buy back, 30% dividends. That dividend portion has been growing. I think we've increased dividends 10 years now and they're up pretty aggressively. But I think it's also an interesting time with the wireless portfolio changes now done that we do try to spend time understanding what's the smartest way to really have that return done. So it remains something that we're active with, we spend time with the board on.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
When we think about acquisitions going forward, obviously, going back in 12, 13 years, there was the Burr-Brown and Unitrode acquisitions that really created the base of large part of the core of what Texas Instruments' great analog business is today. Then over the years, between then and the National acquisition, there was a series of smaller acquisitions and obviously, National now Silicon Valley Analog was another very significant acquisition. Going forward, is that how we should think about it, a big one and then, while that digestion is going on some smaller ones, or do you have an appetite for another big one in the nearer term?
Richard K. Templeton
My careful answer is far more, we're pretty focused right now just because I think it's important to do a really quality job, and let's not get distracted. So I then go on to not trying to characterize, would it be small or big, but stay focused in the near term with what we have. And as you know, and you've got good insight into a number of these companies, the number of things that really meet that spec of catalog of industrial with long life -- and by the way, they've got to be able to pay back, that tends to shorten that list down quite a bit because valuations are usually pretty good on companies doing that. You've heard me say that I think the National opportunity was really a once-in-a-lifetime chance even though there were questions about valuations paid at the time, just to be able to get that type of -- piece of property at the price we paid. And therefore, we can make a payback, but you just don't see those that often.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Is the payback the hardest criteria to meet so that better companies, just the ROI on the deal [indiscernible].
Richard K. Templeton
Well-run companies, they need to be valued.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
So there are companies you would like to have but just the math doesn't work.
Richard K. Templeton
I'm careful with that. I'd like to have -- and just if stuff can't meet that spec -- you don't even need to speculate. It's just pretty mechanical.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
So how about then on Silicon Valley? As you said the company was losing share. You talked about stabilizing that, and then turning that around. Where do you stand in that transition process, and how do you feel about it at this stage?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, we described at the time somewhat a pretty logical flow, which is expect year 1, it would be below market; year 2, about market; year 3, above. And logically, it's clear, design in window or design in lead time usually takes that long to be able to have a different result. So why would you think it's going to magically get better in year 1? And it's falling about in line to what we expected on that. We certainly have the benefit in hindsight of some experience with Burr-Brown, experience with Unitrode. So leading indicators all feel good in terms of design wins, attention, energy of people, very pleased with what's happening on that. But I very quickly also remind the team internally, leading indicators are nice, results are what really count, and we're now getting into year 2. And so this will be an important year to start to see some of that show up.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
You had talked specifically about some of the cross-selling opportunities, the complementary nature of their high voltage products and your portable products and across the data converter line. Are those specific opportunities where you want them to be at this point?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. Jim. The thing that -- and I'm sure the audience has heard this and you've seen this when you talk to other companies, acquisitions are always a little scary because you try to be very thorough in your analysis and your thesis of what you're going to get. And then there's, you open up the box, and you hope it's close to what you were counting on. And where I'm pleased is it's everything, and we really haven't had surprises in terms of ""Oh, gosh, this was busted or rotten,"" or ""we didn't have that"" and I think that goes back to I think we're very thorough in what to expect and where things were so things like high-speed converters and high-speed amps, great complementary opportunities. Things on the power side, some of the capabilities of tools like WEBENCH that let designers design power systems online. These were all hope to be good and they really have turned out. And the quality of the people, that's something the only way you can judge that prior to the acquisition is you have to look at the quality of the parts and you guys say, well, if they're putting out the high-quality parts then there's got to be some good people inside doing it. And we've been pleased to find out that, that really did tie. And I think the team is pleased to be part of TI, and more importantly, I don't think it's to be part of TI, I think the team is pleased to have a chance to grow and win. That's what most designers want is, I want my parts to be successful. I want to be part of a winning team and I want to see when I design a chip I want to see customers putting it in their systems and ramping it up. That's why a lot of our people get into this business, and I think we've got that working.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And the retention of the engineers that you were focused on keeping?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, it's worked out quite well so far, and I think the thing that you always have to remember is yes, you've got to be successful in that first year, that first 2 years. But then you've also got to make sure you're providing a great environment for the long term. It's not a 1-year, 2-year event, and that's where the focus is.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Great. So one end market that I wanted to come back to and focus a little bit was on the communications infrastructure market. And that's a market that's been a little bit weaker and not a little bit weaker, it's been weaker. And maybe a little bit frustrating for all of us over the last year or 2. If you take the bottom-up carrier CapEx estimates and kind of look at what that implies, that market should certainly inflect this year; you guys are well positioned there. So I was wondering if you could talk about that and then the small cell opportunity on top of the division of the broader market.
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, Jim, you just almost asked and answered it in many ways. And we've been very thorough on trying to make sure it's really easy for a group to say, ""Yes, yes, yes, our revenue is down but trust me, we're not losing share,"" trust but verify. And you just triangulate across you see the data, you look into the FPGA guidance, which were pretty good indicators and that's common for structure space is just weak. And they've also historically been, again, as you know, their supply chains tend to run hot. And when they get them hot they tend also go to the other extreme. And so if you take most of the public statements and what carriers' plans are with CapEx, I agree with your translation that even though things look kind of bleak right now, it's probably going to be constructive as you move forward on that. And my confidence really is on 2 fronts. First is we're not moving fewer bits around this world, and you're going to go to advanced equipment because the only way to get data capacity up is to keep moving forward. So the carrier investments will go up on that front. And then go that to the last part of your question on small cell, I think that's an extension. The only way that the carriers are going to get the spectral efficiency or the data capacity with the limited spectrum that they've got is go to different architectures, primarily small cell. You'll find lots of speculation is it '13, is it '14, will the U.S. lead? When are other countries going to follow? I'm careful only because I lived through the 2G rollout, 2.5G, 3G, and we usually get a little too worked up before the rollout, but then it usually ends up happening in pretty large-scale. I think this one will probably do some of that, will look that same way. I don't know which quarter, I don't know which year, but there'll be more of that equipment shipped in the future than less.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Great. Well, we actually used up all the time even though we didn't get through all the questions. I really appreciate you being here again. Thank you so much and look forward to doing it again soon.
Richard K. Templeton
Jim, thanks and hopefully your long-term trend line is correct and [indiscernible].
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, you and me both hope that. Thanks.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter Year-end Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for March 7. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.
Let me start with the market environment. Revenue in the fourth quarter was in the upper half of our range of expectations. We expected the environment to be weak again last quarter, and it was. Visibility remains poor, and it is difficult to predict our business trends with precision. That said, we expect revenue in the first quarter to be seasonal except for those wireless mobile product lines that we are exiting. We continue to believe that inventory levels at OEMs and our distribution channels remain low.
Even in this weak demand environment, our strategy is producing strong results. Notably, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and almost $3 billion in the year. This is a result of a strengthening product portfolio as more of our revenue comes from Analog and Embedded Processing products, 72% in the fourth quarter. It is also a result of our strategic capacity investments over the past few years that have allowed us to reduce capital spending and will now allow us to maintain capital spending at historically low levels in the years ahead, while continuing to have a strong capability for growth.
We continue to return our excess capital to our shareholders last year, returning 90% of free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends. Kevin will provide more on this in a few minutes.
Let me now walk through the quarter's results. Revenue of $2.98 billion, declined 13% from a year ago and 12% sequentially. Analog revenue declined 2% from a year ago and 9% sequentially. From a year ago, Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog, both catalog-oriented product lines, declined, while High Volume Analog & Logic was about even and Power Management grew. Sequentially, revenues declined in all product lines. In this sequential comparison, we were encouraged that Silicon Valley Analog performed about the same as the other product lines, despite the additional revenue headwinds associated with our conversion of its distribution business to a consignment inventory model. We estimate that we are about 1/3 of the way through the consignment program transition for this product line.
Embedded Processing increased 6% from a year ago, mostly due to higher revenue from products sold into communications infrastructure, although revenue from catalog products and automotive products was also higher. Sequentially, Embedded Processing declined 10% with lower revenue in all 3 major product lines.
Wireless revenue declined 56% from a year ago. Baseband revenue fell to $64 million and was the majority of the decline, although OMAP applications processors and connectivity products also declined significantly. Sequentially, Wireless revenue fell 2% with connectivity products down, OMAP even and baseband revenue up.
Our other segment revenues declined 7% from a year ago and 25% sequentially. From a year ago, the decline was mostly due to the expiration of transitional supply agreements, although DLP revenue also declined. Revenue from custom ASIC products and royalties increased. Sequentially, revenue declined primarily due to the seasonal drop in calculator revenue. Revenue from DLP products and custom ASIC products also declined, while royalties increased. The sequential revenue was also impacted by the non-recurrence of $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds associated with the 2011 Japan earthquake.
Turning to distribution. Revenues -- or resales grew 4% from a year ago and declined 2% from the prior quarter. Distributors reduced their TI inventory by several days in the quarter to a little below 6 weeks.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by walking through some of the charges and benefits in the quarter that were included in our reported results. Acquisition charges in the fourth quarter were $88 million. We recorded charges on the restructuring charges/other line of our income statement of $12 million, associated with the previously announced planned closure of several older factories. Together, these acquisition and restructuring charges negatively impacted EPS by $0.06 in the quarter as we had expected and included in our guidance.
Additionally, we also reported charges associated with our Wireless business restructuring that we announced in November. At that time, we expected the associated charges to be about $325 million. Charges were higher than we had expected at $351 million. We had expected the EPS impact of this charge to be $0.21, and this was the amount we included in our mid-quarter guidance. It actually came in at about $0.23. Combined, these 3 charges round at $0.28 of EPS in the quarter.
Finally, we had a discrete tax benefit in the quarter, primarily associated with additional U.S. tax benefits that we received from manufacturing related to the years 2000 through 2006. This tax benefit and the associated interest was not in our outlook and provided a $0.15 benefit to the earnings per share in the fourth quarter.
So let me summarize the impact of the charges and the discrete tax benefits. Reported earnings per share was $0.23. The net of these items I just discussed was a negative impact of $0.13. Since most of you excludes these items from your submissions to First Call, the non-GAAP earnings per share would round to $0.36.
Gross profit of $1.45 billion was 48.5% of revenue, a decrease of 17% sequentially. The decline was mostly the result of a lower product revenue through the non-recurrence of $60 million in business interruption proceeds associated with the Japan earthquake was also a negative factor. It's also informative to compare gross profit margin from the year-ago quarter. In that quarter, gross profit was negatively impacted by $103 million of acquisition-related charges.
On the surface, this largely explains the 320 basis point increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue. Yet note that revenue is now $441 million lower, and our underutilization expense is $170 million compared with $111 million in the year-ago quarter. If you adjust for the acquisition-related charge and for the underutilization expense, gross margin improved by 270 basis points. I believe this helps highlight the benefit that results as more of our revenue comes from high-quality Analog and Embedded Processing products and as we achieve lower exposure to less profitable Wireless products.
Operating expenses of $855 million declined 7% in both comparisons. From a year ago, this mostly reflects lower product development costs and the synergies we've continued to achieve from our acquisition of National, partially offset by increases in sales and marketing costs in Asia from the prior quarter to reflect combination of tight expense control and seasonally lower holiday and vacation time. We also saw the beginnings of savings from our Wireless restructuring.  Other income and expense was $39 million of income this quarter due to the interest on our discrete tax benefit.  Net income in the fourth quarter was $264 million or $0.23 per share on a GAAP basis.
Let me make a few comments on our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $1.09 billion, up $115 million from the prior year for the year-ago quarter and down $119 million from the prior quarter. We made a $280 million contribution to fund our retirement pension plans in the fourth quarter compared with $102 million in the year-ago quarter and $20 million in the prior quarter. We also lowered our inventory by 91 million in the quarter. Inventory days increased to 103 days from 100 days last quarter. This is a level that is within our planning range.
Free cash flow was $989 million, up $171 million from the year-ago quarter, as capital expenditures declined, and down $66 million from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $96 million in the quarter, down $56 million from a year ago and down $53 million sequentially. Our capital expenditures for the year were less than 4% of revenue. We believe we can continue to operate at the low end of our targeted expenditure range of 4% to 7% of revenue for several years, given our strong capacity position that resulted from our strategic investments over the past few years. As we fill up these low price capacities, the resulting cash flow should be strong.
As you've seen in the past, we continue to be responsible stewards of the capital, returning to our shareholders any amounts that we don't need. Accordingly, we used $600 million in the quarter to repurchase 20.6 million shares of TI common stock. This was the same as the prior quarter. We also paid dividends in the quarter of $235 million, up 21% from the prior quarter.
Orders of $2.72 billion in the quarter fell by 16% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.91 in the quarter from 0.96 last quarter. The lower backlog reflects the combination of weakening demand, seasonality and customers' unwillingness to commit to extended backlog in an environment of uncertain demand for their own products and short lead times for our products.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.91 billion in the first quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue will be down $179 million sequentially. About 3/4 of this decline is expected to come from the continued wind-down of our wireless mobile product lines, as Wireless segment revenues are expected to decline about $135 million in the first quarter. The remainder of our revenue would therefore decline about 2% at the middle of the range, the decline that is consistent with the seasonal average in the first quarter.
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.32. We expect first quarter earnings per share results will be negatively affected by about $0.06 from acquisition and restructuring charges, assuming the company's marginal tax rate of 35%.
We also will have a discrete tax benefit of about $65 million or $0.06 per share that results from the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit that was made retroactive to the beginning of 2012. Since this wasn't signed into law until January of this year, accounting rules did not allow us to recognize this tax credit in our 2012 income statement. Accordingly, we will record the 2012 R&D tax credit as a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013.
I should note that operating expenses in the first quarter typically increases, reflecting the seasonal timing of increased vacations and holidays in the fourth quarter and annual pay and benefit increases in the first quarter. These pressures will continue to exist this quarter. However, they should be largely offset by savings that are resulting from our Wireless restructuring actions. For the year, our estimate for R&D expense is $1.6 billion. This is down from almost $1.9 billion in 2012 as we benefit from our Wireless restructuring. Our estimate for capital expenditures is $500 million, well below our depreciation estimate of $900 million. Our estimated effective tax rate is 22%.
Most of our comments today have been focused on the quarter and not the year, since 2012 is mostly old news at this point. Let me make a few observations now. Our overall revenue declined $910 million in a weak economic environment. The positive impact of including Silicon Valley Analog slightly more than offset our lower wireless baseband revenue as we exited that product line. That is a trade-off that we are happy to make, and the combination of Analog and Embedded Processing was 70% of our revenue for the year. By comparison, 5 years ago, Analog and Embedded Processing were 47% of our revenue.
For the year, capital expenditures, even as a percent of depressed revenue, hit a new low, and we expect them to stay low. Free cash flow increased to 23% of revenue for 2012. We expect our free cash flow to remain strong in the years ahead, as our solid capacity positions mean that we have almost half of our capacity today, available to support future growth, while we remain -- maintain capital spending at very low levels. As you've seen in the past, our shareholders will benefit as we continue to return our excess capital to you in the form of share repurchases and higher dividends.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Before turning to Q&A, let me describe some upcoming changes in our segment financial reporting structure. Beginning with the First Quarter 2013 Financial Report in April, we will transition our segment reporting to align with the company's strategic focus and new organizational structure. The Wireless segment will be eliminated as we have announced that we are winding down investments in these products for the smartphones and consumer tablet markets. Financial results for these products will be included in the other segment for the remainder of their life, which we anticipate will be essentially completed in 2013. Financial results for Wireless products that address embedded applications, a strategic focus for the company, will be reported in the Embedded Processing segments. To facilitate making appropriate adjustments to your financial models, we expect to have historical data for the segments available for you in March.
Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
"
2013-01-22,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to C.J. Muse from Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I apologize if you already covered this. Curious if you could talk end market. I know you're -- you've cited low visibility, but we would love to hear, I guess, your thoughts on how you see the book-to-bill tracking into Q1 and where you see the recovery coming from.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Well, let's start with the question of -- part of your question where you said basically how is it continuing into Q1. And I guess what I would say is again, maybe -- and before I talk about January, just go back and describe what we saw in the fourth quarter with a bit more detail. So fourth quarter revenue declined each month. So obviously, that left December as the weakest month of the quarter. Book-to-bill, as we've noted, was 0.91 in the quarter. And therefore, as you might guess, the demand visibility is poor. What we've seen thus far in January is that both revenue and orders have strengthened when compared with December. So that leads us to an outlook that is a little stronger than the fourth quarter book-to-bill and orders might otherwise have suggested. And again, as we have said, if you exclude the Wireless segment, the -- from the rest of our revenue, we would expect to decline about 2% at the midpoint of our range, really consistent with normal seasonality for a first quarter. By end market, I don't have a lot of color. Probably, the best takeaway is that what we saw in fourth quarter was broadly weak. I'll walk through a couple of end markets. Computing clearly continued to be weak in the quarter. Communications was weak. I think we gave you some pretty good visibility directly into what we were seeing with handsets and tablets. But again, there are some TI-specific trends in there as we're exiting some of those product lines. From an infrastructure standpoint, particularly base stations, again, I would describe that market as weak with spending levels by operators in U.S., Europe and China all remaining constrained to this point. Consumer would maybe be an area where I would say things are somewhat mixed. TV sales remain weak, generally reflecting the economy. Industrial, same, weak. Automotive inside of industrial would be mixed regionally with the sales in the U.S., strong but China and Europe, both weak. And those were more what we were seeing by end market in the fourth quarter, I don't really have any end market color to provide in terms of our first quarter outlook. Do you have a follow-on, C.J.?
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Yes, that's helpful. As a follow-up, in terms of the R&D guidance for the full year, can you discuss what to expected the linearity looks like?
Kevin P. March
C.J., I think -- it'll decline a little bit in the first half as we wind down the Wireless activity. We had some remaining commitments with Wireless customers that we'll have to continue to honor during the first half as we wind that down. And I expect, by the middle of the year, it will probably reach its run rate.
Operator
We'll now go to Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Kevin, just a clarification to make sure I heard it right. Did you say that OpEx would basically be flat sequentially because the cost savings are offsetting the usual seasonality?
Kevin P. March
We do expect OpEx to increase a bit, but it will largely be offset by the savings from the Wireless restructuring that we announced. But it won't be completely offset.
Ron Slaymaker
One more, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Sure, just looking on the embedded businesses, that's now obviously one of your core businesses. The operating margin in that is seen to have been depressed for 2 years running, even though flat revenue seemed to be what you guys could deliver. Can you talk about is that more of a gross margin or an OpEx-driven phenomenon? And what sort of growth expectations do you have to get the operating margin in that segment back to kind of a historical TI level or a peer group average?
Kevin P. March
Ross, in the Embedded Processing, your observation is accurate. It has been operating at -- operating profit levels below what we have in mind for that business. You may recall that about 1.5 years ago, we stepped up pretty significantly the amount of resources that we were putting into that business, particularly on the microcontroller side as it relates to our field applications engineers and other activities to support the growth in that product portfolio. In the meantime, of course, we've seen some of our stronger markets in the Embedded Processing space, namely the communications infrastructure, being weak for the past year, as well as catalog being somewhat weak in this generally slow macroeconomy. So between the weakness in our 2 larger markets and the fact that we stepped up the investment 1.5 year plus ago, those are combined, it would cause the operating margins to be at levels lower than we would prefer to have them operating at. So really going forward, this is all about getting the revenue line back into a growth mode to absorb the cost structure that's in place in that division today.
Operator
We'll now go to Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First question, can you just talk about inventory trends, what you expect the disti [distribution] to do in terms of inventory? And then also what do you guys expect to do in terms of your own utilization rates and inventory?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, I'll talk about distribution and I'll let Kevin talk about TI. Again, Chris, let me maybe even add some color to what happened last quarter because that will foretell a little bit about what we should see partly going forward. So if you'll note, we said distribution inventory fell by just over 0.5 week last quarter, ending up at a little under 6 weeks. About 1/3 of that decline is due to the conversion of SVA over to an inventory consignment program at distribution. And so with that still in the early stages, you'll see a few more days of inventory impact over the next couple of quarters associated with that SVA consignment conversion. And again, that would have the effect of lowering each quarter maybe a couple of days disti inventory. And again, that could be overwhelmed by distributors choosing to start replenishing inventory as they prepare for a stronger market environment should they choose to. But that will be the one event that we can't foretell. Kevin, do you want to talk about TI inventory?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Actually, the point that Ron just made about that change in SVA certainly results in net inventory revenue being -- distributors' books winds up being on our books. Our days of inventory were up a couple days in the quarter to 103. Clearly, well within the ranges where we want to carry it out. As we go forward, we'll continue to carry inventory levels similar to what you've seen us carry this past year, 100, 100-plus days as we become more and more Analog and Embedded Processing focused. And if you take a look at most of our competitors, I think you'll find in the recent quarters, the average are between 90 and 130 days of inventories. And you should expect to see us carrying inventory days quite a bit higher than you might have thought about, let's say, 5 years ago. From a utilization standpoint, I think you asked the question on that, Chris. Utilization was down in the quarter, and we had an underutilization charge in the quarter of about $170 million. That compares to about $146 million in the last quarter. We aren't -- we don't have a forecast for where that goes going forward. But keep in mind that production tends to lead expected shipments and typically, we'd see second quarter up seasonally. So we would be sure to be staging inventory in anticipation of a normal seasonal 2Q.
Ron Slaymaker
So maybe if I can just add a little more color. Part of the reason we will carry more inventory as Analog and Embedded grow as a percentage of our revenue is that a high percentage of those products are long-lived catalog devices. They tend to be off the shelf. You tend to carry more inventory on those. And by the way, because of the long-lived nature of them, that inventory has much lower risk of obsolescence than, say, the type of custom products or very high volume products that went to very few customers. That would be represented, for example, in areas like Wireless. So as that mix changes, we become more catalog oriented in terms of the product profile by nature our product -- our inventory will trend up compared to our history. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes, just a quick one. Can you give us sort of what your core business is doing sort of this quarter, normal seasonality? Can you just go into what you think we should be looking at, assuming we get back to normal -- what we should think of as normal seasonality for TI in Q2, 3 and 4? And then also, what would be the impact of the Wireless business going away on top of that seasonality?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Sure, Chris, and I will -- I'm going to start by giving you average 5 years seasonality unadjusted for any outlier years. You can do whatever you want on that. And this already comprehends no Wireless, and it does comprehend SVA as part of TI. So it really is reflective of, I think, the product lines that you are interested in. So first quarter, that 5-year average is minus 3% sequentially. Second quarter is up 9%. And don't forget that second quarter also has probably a couple of points impact at the company level associated with back-to-school seasonality for our calculator product line. Third quarter, sequential average is 5%. And then fourth quarter is down 11%. And similarly, third to fourth has the back-to-school negative transition associated with calculators. So of that down 11%, probably 3 of those points come directly from the calculator product lines. So I guess, all I can say in terms -- that gives you the seasonal pattern adjusted for Wireless. Now of course, this year overriding that, you're going to have a decline in the Wireless revenue. I don't have a profile quarter-by-quarter of what that decline will look like, Chris, other than generally we would expect, as I said previously, that by the end of 2013, that revenue is essentially gone. Baseband will be, I think, the numbers we gave you would put it down sub 1% of TI revenue in the first quarter. Of course, OMAP and the connectivity lines are larger than that, but we would expect that they would be essentially gone by the time we close out 2013.
Operator
We'll now go to John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I guess my first question, Kevin, on gross margins. How much did royalty help the December quarter? And as I look into March, I'm trying to reconcile much better mix, probably less of an underutilization charge with gross margins. And maybe I'm just doing my math wrong relative to the midpoint of your guide, that I can't get much above 47.5% to maybe high 47%. Can you help me reconcile that, please?
Kevin P. March
Yes, John. On the gross margins, the royalty in the quarter was about $60 million. Going forward, we expect that's probably going to be about $160 million for the year, give or take a little bit. On the gross margin outlook, I think you're asking about it in your model, keep in mind that I did mention our underutilization charge was up this quarter, as we took our utilization down. But even as we readjust the factories in anticipation of a seasonal up second quarter, average use of utilization across 2 quarters really won't change that much. So we wouldn't expect our underutilization charge to really change much, 4Q to 1Q. I'm not sure what else you have in your model, but that maybe -- and maybe that helps explain where you're getting to.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
No, that is helpful. And I guess, Ron, as my follow-up, when you look at the $180 million left in the Wireless in the March quarter, how much of that is -- well, would you use -- argue as core versus non-core? And had that stayed as a separate bucket, what kind of operating loss should we have expected at that kind of revenue level?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. John, probably, the best I can give you is that if you look at last year, we had -- for the total segment, we had roughly $1.35 billion, $1.36 billion of revenue. About $150 million of that, that was in the Wireless segment, will move over into the Embedded Processing segment. So I think that's what you're calling core there. There are also, just to clarify, there was some OMAP revenue already in the Embedded Processing segment that was addressing automotive, but the amount that was inside of the Wireless segment was about $150 million. I think that ratio is probably pretty consistent with where we were at the end of the year in fourth quarter. So probably, if you use that as a rough starting point for transitioning into first quarter, you would get about the right number. I think we've said that the $135 million decline, I know when I look at just on a percentage basis, what that represented for the Wireless segment was about true for baseband also, meaning, I think that translates to a little over 40% sequential decline in the Wireless segment revenue. It was about that same amount for baseband. So therefore, for OMAP and connectivity, it would also be about that same amount in terms of the mobile side of those product lines. I guess that was your follow-on, John.
Operator
We'll now go with Glen Yeung from Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
When you're thinking about the products that are related to Wireless, for example, you may cross-sell Analog when you're selling Wireless products, have those products sort of followed your expectations now that Wireless is falling off? Are they sort of moving along the lines you would have expected or better or worse?
Ron Slaymaker
I think at this point, Glen, they're probably moving independent of the Wireless actions I guess I would say, which is generally what we would expect. And I think we've talked before even on the conference call that clearly, you can put together a more negative scenario that says yes, but OMAP Connectivity probably pulls along Analog revenue. I would argue that I think our experience has been we have to win those Analog sockets or those Analog opportunities case by case, and there really is not that much of a direct tie to the OMAP and Connectivity business. And then I think we could even put together a more, what I'll call bullish scenario that says a lot of our historical applications processor competitors, we would like to engage with them on their reference designs for Power Management products. But because we were a direct application processor competitor, I suspect there was some hesitancy to engage with TI on the reference design on some of these Analog Power Management opportunities. And we have a great capability in Power Management and Integrated Power Management to align with their product portfolios, and I suspect you'll find that some of those doors open as we're no longer competing directly with them in the application processor space. So again, those are different scenarios that could develop. But I would say, to date, we're not seeing necessarily upside. We're not seeing things ticking down as a result of our Wireless. I think we're seeing things move independent, which probably is roughly as we would expect. Do you have a follow-on, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I do. With respect now to maybe a bigger picture question on the cycle -- it sort of comes in 2 parts. One is you're talking about a seasonal second quarter and at the same time, you're saying visibility is relatively low. So I wonder if you can just address that issue. And maybe you can put that in the context of the overall cycle and comparing and contrasting what we're seeing today versus what we may have seen in the past in terms of the way cycles play themselves out.
Ron Slaymaker
Glen, let me just clarify. We have not described our second quarter expectations as seasonal. All I did previously was give the average seasonality, that 5-year average for each of the quarters of the year. We did describe our expectations at the middle of the guidance range for the non-Wireless revenue. Basically, it computes to a down 2%, which we described as seasonal. But we're not trying to, at this point, make any commentary about our expectations for the second quarter.

We'll now go to Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
First one, can you talk about utilization in your RFAB and other fabs? I think, Kevin, you had mentioned about $170 million or so in underutilization charges. Is there a cash versus noncash component on these charges?
Kevin P. March
Vivek, we won't -- I won't go into specific details by factory as to utilization because they fluctuate pretty much every week, every month, every quarter. But I did mention there was $170 million of underutilization charges. And roughly half of that is noncash, half of it, cash, give or take a few million in each side of that.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. If I were to look at just your profitability, I think in the past, you had set a business model of 55% gross margins and 30% operating margins, if memory serves me right. Now that you were exiting the Wireless segment, how should we think about TI's new business model or operating model once the demand environment normalizes?
Kevin P. March
Vivek, I think, you should think about it as Analog becomes a bigger portion, Analog and Embedded Processing become an ever bigger portion. You should see more of what we've seen in the past, and that is our ability to generate very, very healthy levels of free cash flow. The result of us being more focused in that area is that our CapEx bill, our capital expenditures bill, will be quite low in part because we have already invested at a very low cost and a lot of capacity. And in part because as Analog and Embedded Processing become a bigger portion of our revenue, they actually can use older factories for a longer period of time, and so they'll require less capital renewal. In addition, the R&D bill is more manageable in those spaces versus where we've been, especially in Wireless. And so that will free up cash as well. So as we move forward, I think you should be thinking about us as being able to not only continue to generate the kinds of healthy free cash flow that we have in years past, but probably even improving going forward, which frankly is good news for our shareholders because as they've seen us do for many years now, we tend to return the overwhelming majority of that free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends, and I expect that we will continue to do so going forward.
Operator
We'll now go to Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Sort of a couple of big picture questions. First, excluding the Wireless wind-down, so if we just focus on your core business. Can you give us kind of the big picture puts and takes of why you might see any different cyclical trends than any of your competitors? In other words, as we hear your competitors potentially start to talk more bullishly about the cycle, is there any reason to think that you wouldn't see the same?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, I suspect very little difference. I mean of course, you have to look at those different competitors and consider how their market exposure compares with TI. I mean, of course, somebody that's highly PC focused is going to have a different dynamic than what TI would. Similarly, somebody that has just a very, very high exposure to industrial might have a different exposure than what -- or with different profile than what TI would with our more broad exposure. But I think what we often find as we go through this process, and you've probably observed is that in the end, we all probably tend to see the same thing, the same market dynamics, with varying pressures as I just described. But coming into the quarter, maybe different levels of just subjective impact on those various guidance going forward. Do you have a follow on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, and I guess I'll stay on that topic for my follow-up. I mean, the reason I really asked the question is because maybe it's just a tone issue or kind of semantics, but relative to a couple of the other companies that have reported and talked about the industry, you guys don't sound quite as upbeat. And again, to your previous answer, I would have expected pretty similar tone and I'm just trying to gauge if there's anything significantly different driving that.
Kevin P. March
Jim, I would just talk that we're respectful of the actual order pattern that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, the book-to-bill of 0.96 in 3Q and 0.91 in 4Q, overall orders declining 16% quarter-over-quarter. That caused us to be respectful as to what the outlook might hold. But while we tempered that a bit, as Ron has indicated earlier in the call, that despite declining sales and revenues, recent 3 months, the fourth quarter, we have seen a turn in that direction in January. And January, certainly, so far is shaping up stronger than what December did. And so for that reason, we're putting our outlook out there and saying we're probably going to be kind of seasonal on the non-Wireless portion of our portfolio.
Operator
We'll now go to Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
First, for the next quarter's guidance, the Wireless business looks like it's falling off maybe -- am I doing my math right, $135 million would be 65% to 70% of kind of the total business that you have that's actually going away over the next year. But it doesn't look like the OpEx is falling off nearly that much yet. So I guess the question there is, number one, is that math correct? You're having actually a very big -- it sounds like a very big step down, is it on that magnitude? But is the OpEx fall off actually less than you've actually seen the revenue fall off for that business? And then what is the OpEx trend in terms of capturing that $450 million in savings look like through the year? When do we actually have it all in?
Ron Slaymaker
I'll let Kevin discuss the OpEx. But you were talking about -- I may be wrong. But again, what we said was the $317 million in our Wireless segment, that will be down $135 million, which would be about 43%. And Stacy, I totally realize, you may be trying to take a subset of that Wireless segment that ties just to the products that are going away, so...
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
That's right, that's right.
Ron Slaymaker
And I'm not saying that's not wrong. I'm just reiterating what we said. Kevin, do you want to comment on OpEx savings?
Kevin P. March
Yes, on the OpEx, we expect to see that savings feather its way in to the P&L over the course of 2013. We saw a little bit in the fourth quarter, probably something in the $10 million range, probably get another $30 million to $40 million or so as we move into the first quarter and continue at that kind of pace until we get to the end of the year. We talked about that by the time we get to the end of the year, on an annualized basis, we should see about $450 million from the costs coming out of the -- most of the OpEx line.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
So it is there to --  go ahead, sorry.
Ron Slaymaker
I was just going to add, Stacy, I think in the first quarter, you have -- you're going to have 2 factors. One is we are exiting these product lines. And the other is just seasonality with some of these wireless customers, which tends to be pretty significant in the fourth to first transition. Go ahead. Do you have a follow on?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
No, I was just going to -- I guess just as a follow-up on that, is it fair to say then that the hit for the Wireless business in Q1 as a percentage of the stuff should be going away, you're losing more of that revenue in Q1 than you're losing the OpEx. Is that a correct way to think about this?
Kevin P. March
I think maybe that when you think about that as the GPM that we're losing on that revenue, is probably falling away at about the same pace as the OpEx. That may be a better way to think about it. And so what the result is, is that, that division by itself, profitability isn't going to be noticeably different than what we just came through until we get the benefit of the rest of the wind-down of the OpEx on that in the balance of the year.
Ron Slaymaker
And they'll accelerate probably as we move through...
Kevin P. March
Move through the year.
Operator
And we'll go to Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I wonder -- if you go back to the analyst meeting earlier in 2012, you talked about the trend line analysis and looked at the sort of we were 19% and [indiscernible] below the trend line and talk about the potential for catching up. And obviously, the weaker macro disrupted that. I believe there was that potential there and it didn't play out. How do you think about that now? How you think about 2013? Are we still below our trend line? Do you think that there's a catch-up and what can drive that to happen?
Kevin P. March
Well, I would say that history -- as soon as you deny the history, you usually wind up finding yourself in trouble. But the history has taught us that we do tend to go back to trend line. It is a little unusual, as you pointed out, Joe, that we haven't made that move back yet. But I would simply say that I wouldn't try challenging the history. I'd say it's probably going to come to pass at some point, a little difficult to call when. What's more important is that operationally, we intend to be ready for it. And by that, what I mean is, we intend to have ample capacity when it comes back. And we intend to do have ample inventory on hand, so that we're able to respond our customers when they do start seeing their normal demand trends occur when they come back toward that trend line.
Ron Slaymaker
And Joe, what I think is really cool about TI's position is we're not sitting here betting our company or betting our future on a particular forecast. We've bought capacity when it was cheap and when it was available and we are in position to support pretty much any kind of upturn profile you can envision over the next year or so. And if it takes a while longer, so be it. We're -- it's fully in the numbers. If it wants to run hard and fast, we're ready to go. So we don't need to go significantly change our capital spending profile to get there. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Sure. The state of the end customer inventories at this point, it seems like that's been lean for several quarters. You had a fair amount of inventory on your books, the distribution channel had enough, and it feels like the customer just hasn't needed to restock. Do you think that dynamic stays in place? Or is there a catalyst that can get a restocking phase to start?
Kevin P. March
Joe, I think that as soon as consumers feel a little bit more confident, have a little bit more sense of certainty as to where things are going, they will probably return to a more normal behavior, which means they won't be continually relying on us being able to ship to them inside the lead times. I think that customers generally perceive that as being a somewhat risky strategy, if in fact, their demand should return. And the big issue, I think, is just waiting for some of the uncertainty to clear up. Certainly, the macro events over the last year have compounded that with the Euro headlines, with the China slowdown, although it does sound like it maybe is beginning to turn a bit on that front. And here in the U.S., of course, the fiscal cliff. We've only had one part of that dealt with so far, and it appears we've got more of that. When some of that stuff gets behind us, I expect our customers will probably go the back to carrying inventory levels that -- where they control their destiny a bit more better than relying on suppliers to be able to ship inside of lead time.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, and certainly, as you said before, any other outcome would be a big bet against history, which tends to repeat itself here.
Operator
And we'll now go to Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montréal.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Guys, on the Silicon Valley Analog, correct me if I'm wrong, it seems you are a quarter ahead of what you promised us in terms of getting that business in sync with the rest of the Analog. And if so, is it too early to call that turn? Or do you expect to see that pattern in the following quarters? And I have a follow-up, Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, I'll add a little. And then, Kevin, if you want to go with it, can as well. I would not describe it as a quarter ahead. Just if you'll recall, we said in the first year, we expect that the -- we expected that -- let me back up. The first year post-acquisitions, which really ended in third quarter of 2012, we expected that it would continue losing market share, which is a trend that had been on. In the second year, we expected that it would become I would call it market neutral, meaning the market share losses would stop. But it would probably still be lagging TI's overall Analog performance since we have a much stronger history over multiple years of share gains. We really did not expect and do not expect SVA to really start having a strong track record of share gains consistent with the rest of TI Analog until the third year. I shouldn't say we do not expect that. I should say that, that was what we had built into our initial assumptions and modeling pre-acquisition. So as you noted from our comments, we have a quarter here where it performed consistent with the rest of TI Analog, even despite a pretty strong headwind of that consignment conversion in the fourth quarter. But, Ambrish, I would say that is 1 quarter. And even though we found that performance encouraging, by no means are we going to declare success. It's an encouraging sign. But we need to see 4 of those quarters strung together before we start declaring anything for the year. And do you have anything else than that? Okay, do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Yes. Just moving over to the Embedded side. Could you please refresh our memory, how big is the Comm infrastructure within that segment? And then where are we from the peak level? And if I remember correctly, the gross margin from a normalized level around is about 100 bps higher, 100 to 500 bps higher than the 55% level?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I'll comment on the revenue mix there and then Kevin, if you have any comments on relative margins. So -- and compared to where we were. So if you just take the year overall, let me just break out the Embedded Processing revenue for you. Catalog was 55% of the revenue mix, and that's the same as it was in 2011. Comms infrastructure was 25% of our Embedded Processing revenue, and that's down about 5 points from where it was in 2011. It was 30% of the mix that year. And then automotive was 20% of our Embedded Processing revenue last year, and that's up from 15%. So that mix is really driven by the disproportionate strength -- and I'm sorry, weakness in the communications infrastructure market last year, combined with the fact that TI has really high market share in that comms infrastructure market. It's a market we think is going to have just really good secular trends in the years ahead. So even though it hurt us a bit in terms of Embedded Processing share last year, we won't forego our position by any means nor make apologies there. And similarly, automotive, just the market was good last year. And TI has a, what I will describe as a building position in automotive. Kevin, do you comments then on the profitability?
Kevin P. March
Yes. As you know, Ambrish, we don't actually report gross margin details of the businesses. But at a high level, if you think about how these businesses run, Embedded Processing really has 3 components that we talked about. The catalog components that are inside there, that tends to be similar to an HPA, SVA kind of business model. And you're going to see margins -- gross margins, probably north of 60%. On the other side, you've got automotive products. And that includes some legacy products that we have in that portfolio. And you will probably see those margin somewhere closer to the 50% level. And then comms infrastructure will tend to run in between the 2 of those over time.

Our next question comes from Shawn Webster from Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
On the Analog, you talked -- you've already talked a bit about the Silicon Valley Analog. I was wondering if you could share with us some of the dynamics happening in the other segments. It looks like for the year or at least on a year-over-year basis, the High Volume Logic and the Power Management were relatively stronger than the High Performance. I was wondering if you could give us some color either on market share or market dynamics there.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay.  Shawn, let me just -- and most of these will be with respect to the fourth quarter as opposed to necessarily for the full year. But I would say that the HPA decline really was pretty broad-based. So I don't know that I can pull out a particular market or product area. HPA, not quite as much as -- or HPA and SVA, I would say, combined, they have a common characteristic of being more catalog oriented, moving through distribution. They probably have higher industrial exposure than what some of the other 2 areas would have, so potentially that could come in as well. HVAL, I would say, we saw some impact from a few areas. One is the HDD market being weak. The other consideration in the fourth quarter was consumer seasonality basically backing down off of what would typically be a stronger third quarter. And then also in the fourth quarter, we saw automotive being a bit weaker. If you look at the Power Management area, sequential trend there was really driven -- again, I'd say pretty broad-based, but the biggest areas that I would kind of just say were most notable would be declines in notebooks, digital television and then also to a lesser degree, handset. Okay. Do you have a follow-on, Shawn?
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
Yes. Just a housekeeping on the tax side of things. So you have a tax benefit in Q1 and you have full year guidance for -- of 22%. Does the 22% include the benefit you'd get in Q1?
Kevin P. March
No, it does not. The benefit in Q1 is a discrete benefit that will be spiked out by itself. It's about $65 million or about $0.06 of EPS. The 22% is the effective tax rate excluding that benefit, so that's the ongoing rate for the year. However, I would note that, that rate does include now the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2013.
Ron Slaymaker
So Shawn, just a kind of hint then when you're looking at your first quarter tax rate in terms of your model, plan on 22%, and then on top of that, add in the $65 million benefit. But if you just look at normal PDT and all that, apply a 22% tax rate and then on top of that, add in the $65 billion -- I'm sorry, $65 million discrete tax benefit. That does not spread across the year or anything like that. So kind of the ongoing rate will be that 22% rate.
Operator
We'll go to Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes, so my first question, you talked about disti resales being down 2% sequentially in the fourth quarter. What were TI's sales to disti in the quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Kevin is looking. I don't know off the top of my head.
Kevin P. March
Our resales were down a little bit also. Actually, their resales were down a bit, but our sales to them were down a little bit as well, with their inventory declining as we mentioned by a couple days to less than 6 weeks.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes. So again, inventory decline, we shipped in less than they shipped out. But that doesn't necessarily change the growth rate. But anyway, down a little bit as well. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes, that's helpful. My follow-on is I know you can't comment really on bookings by end market so far this quarter. But could you comment on maybe by region? Or is this very broad-based, whether it's OEM or disti?
Ron Slaymaker
In terms of the January trends, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Correct, yes.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, I don't have a regional breakout. I can offer you a consolation prize and talk about what happened regionally last quarter since we haven't discussed that. But I don't have the month-to-date data by region. In this last quarter, this is a pretty weak consolation prize I'll admit, because it's revenue as opposed to bookings. But in the fourth quarter, we had all regions down, with Asia being down the most. And that would be followed then by the U.S. as well. From there, Europe and Japan. Okay. Sorry, we didn't have that detail for you, Tore.
And with that, we're going to close off the call. Before we end, let me remind you that a replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' Fourth Quarter 2012 Mid-Quarter Update Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the fourth quarter of 2012. In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS ranges for the company. In general, I will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segment or end markets, and I will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information. As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings from our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $2.89 billion and $3.01 billion, a range that has been narrowed to the middle of our prior range. We expect earnings per share between $0.05 and $0.09 on a GAAP basis. In addition to the $0.06 of acquisition and restructuring charges included in our original guidance for the quarter, EPS also now includes $0.21 of charges associated with the previously announced restructuring in our wireless segment.
As a reminder, we said the wireless restructuring charges would be about $325 million in total, of which about $220 million is for severance and related benefits, and most of the remainder is for noncash impairments related to the Wireless business. Most of these charges will be recognized in the current quarter, although some are subject to the outcome of required negotiations in countries outside the U.S.
If you're having trouble translating the charge amount to the EPS impact in the quarter, please note that goodwill impairment is not tax-deductible. The $0.21 impact that I identified comprehends the tax treatment.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. I will provide you the opportunity to ask a follow-up question. Operator?
"
2012-12-10,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
Patrick Walsh  - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
This is Patrick Walsh calling in for John Pitzer. Just have a quick question on the profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, it looks a little better. Curious, is that all driven by wireless?
Ron Slaymaker
No. Actually, the cost reductions that we're -- the restructuring that we're doing in wireless really won't have any significant impact this quarter as most of the employment reductions are happening late in the quarter. What you're seeing probably translates to about $0.01 better on a, as you call, a non-GAAP basis or however you would get there. And what I would say is that's really just we're continuing to generally tighten down on expenses where possible and that really is just considering the weak environment that we're operating in. So again, just holding a tight rein on expenses. You have a follow-on, Patrick?
Patrick Walsh  - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes. As a follow-up, do you think that the Wireless business can get to breakeven in the calendar first quarter? And if so, do you expect to be able to stay breakeven as revenue declines going forward?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Let me -- the answer to that whole situation is complex. Let me just start with the fourth quarter. I would say that wireless, clearly in the fourth quarter will have an operating loss because it will include the restructuring charge. Going forward, I really don't have a date for you on when that loss will go away as it depends on how fast the revenue declines relative to the cost. I think we said back on our October call that we expect that our baseband revenue in first quarter will be about half of the level that it was in the fourth quarter. So again, considering the baseband revenues declining and then on top of that how fast the OMAP and connectivity declines occur from a revenue standpoint will really drive what will happens from our profitability or loss perspective. Okay, Patrick, thank you for your call.
Operator
Next, we'll hear from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Let me just a follow up on the last question. What do you see is the tail for the OMAP and connectivity business? It seems like your customer base in the next couple of quarters probably doesn't change all that much. I mean, is there going to be a fairly healthy tail in that business the next couple quarters?
Ron Slaymaker
Joe, that's a good question. I should have clarified that on the prior call. We -- the revenue that's there, which this year for OMAP and connectivity products that are sold into smartphones and tablet applications, probably will be about $800 million total. In the fourth quarter, it will be right around $200 million. And again, that's not the entire segment revenue for OMAP and connectivity because some of that is sold into embedded applications, probably a couple hundred million dollars in 2012. But the $800 million overall for 2012 that's sold into smartphones and tablets or the $200 million in fourth quarter for smartphones and tablets we would expect to decline through the course of 2013 such that it's gone by the time we enter 2014. And then probably a similar trajectory in terms of the cost savings. The cost will decline through the course of 2013, and as we enter 2014, we will have about $450 million of annualized cost savings, again, as we enter 2014 or by the end of 2013. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Yes. Just on that note, the $450 million, how does that split between operating expense and cost of sales savings?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, the estimate we have is about 75% of that will be R&D, about 15% SG&A and then about 10% cost of revenue. Okay, Joe, thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
First one, following up on the OMAP side of things with connectivity. Do you expect any impact on your Analog side of your business as some of those connectivity products and OMAP brought Analog along for the ride?
Ron Slaymaker
Ross, I mean clearly, we have -- not sure I would agree that they're along for the ride. But we do have good Analog content typically in a system where we're selling OMAP yet. And clearly if we have an applications processor in the system, that gives our sales folks good visibility into that overall system. That being said, those Analog products kind of have to earn their way; each product.  Customers aren't going to accept an interior Analog product just because they're using our application processors. So our view is that our Analog products will continue to do fine in the tablet and smartphone applications. And in fact, what I can -- I can also envision the scenario that they could even benefit because I mean think about -- we work with other application processor suppliers on their reference designs to include our Analog products to the extent they don't view us as an application processor competitor, we might find some of those other application processors suppliers more amenable and cooperative on the Analog side. So we'll see that conjecture, but I think we'll do just fine on the Analog side of those systems. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, I do. Getting away from OMAP maybe for a second, just talk about the quarter. The mid-quarter, you guys tightened to the midpoint of range on revenues. Any either product line or end market color you can give us about positives and negatives quarter-to-date, please?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, sure. And let me just make a couple of reminders. As you would probably guess, the fact that we tightened to the middle of the range is generally most areas are tracking consistent with our expectations that we had in October. But just as a reminder, there are a few special considerations in this sequential trend this quarter that a reminder is probably worth a few minutes. First of all, our calculated revenue typically declined by about $100 million in the fourth quarter following the peak third quarter back-to-school season. Second consideration is that we had $60 million in the third quarter of business interruption insurance proceeds that was the final settlement from last year's earthquake in Japan. So that amount will not recur again this quarter. And I think the final point I would make is that in our October call, I explained that our SVA Analog product line would begin to convert over to a consignment inventory program at distribution this quarter, and that really is the result of us getting that SVA business, which again was the former national semiconductor operation converted over to TI's IT system. So with that, we'll be able to move them to the same type of consignment inventory program we have with distributors. That conversion will impact our revenue this quarter. But certainly, distributors are anxious to move over to the program. So with those 3 considerations, I would say the remainder of our semiconductor revenue is generally clustered around a 7% to 8% sequential revenue decline.
From an end markets standpoint, let me just quickly go through those. Computing continues to be weak this quarter. In communications, I would characterize it also as weak. If you look at handsets and tablets, our baseband revenue, we would expect to be seasonally flat, maybe even up a little this quarter, although that will be more than offset by revenue declines in OMAP and connectivity, again, for smartphones and tablets. I guess I don't normally provide a longer-term outlook in this update but given our recent announcement to discontinue our investments for OMAP and connectivity products in the smartphones and tablet areas, let me go ahead and note that we expect this revenue again to decline from about $200 million to be gone by the end of 2013. So just a reminder on that.
In communications infrastructure, particularly wireless base stations, that revenue continues to be weak with spending levels by operators constrained pretty much across the world. So specifically the U.S., Europe and China where there has a historically been -- those regions have historically been drivers there. Consumer, as a result they're somewhat mixed TV sales remain weak as they were last quarter reflecting the overall economy. And we believe actually the emergence of tablets as an alternative viewing device for video is probably having some impact there as well.
Game consoles are doing well and e-books also are doing well for TI. And then finally in industrial I would say overall, demand generally remains weak. Inside of our automotive sales are mixed regionally with the U.S. strong, but both China and Europe weak. Okay, that was a long answer to a quick question, Ross. So thank you for that.

Next, we'll hear from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color, Ron, on order linearity. I think last -- the earnings call, you said September orders were the low point in Q3. October's kind of flattish. Can you give us some view for how November and December tracking relative both to those points in September, October relative to your expectations?
Ron Slaymaker
Stacy, I don't have feedback for you on linearity but what I will say is just in general, we expect that orders will decline this quarter and they're largely tracking the revenue result trends. So what I mean by that is they're weakest for our other segments due to the seasonal calculated declines and again, that nonrecurrence of the business interruption insurance. They're also weakest for our SVA product line due to the conversion to the distribution consignment program and the impact that it has both on revenue, as well as orders. But I don't have the month-by-month linearity feedback for you. Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Yes, I do. That's helpful. I think around -- if I go back to wireless just a second, the chunk that's remaining the embedded OMAP connectivity, it's got $200 million in annual revenue right now. What are your targets for the economics of that business following the completion of your restructuring? Is that going to be making money? Is it going to be breakeven or will be losing money at that level? Do we assume growth in order to make money?
Ron Slaymaker
No. Our expectation is that the loss that you've seen our wireless segment incur over the last few quarters will largely be eliminated by the restructuring action that we have underway. And so that's not assuming growth or anything like that. It's just taking the loss and taking the cost actions and recognizing we're going to lose about $800 million of revenue and therefore, gross profit is associated with that. But the cost savings that we're implementing should largely offset or essentially offset that loss. And so we'll just leave it at that. Okay, Stacy, thank you.
Operator
Moving on, we'll hear from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Great. Thanks especially for the market commentary by area. In consideration of that, is there an area where you feel more most confident that your under shipping demand and inventories getting drawn down in the channel? And then conversely, are there are still areas where you think you might be over shipping demand?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, I don't know of any area that we're over shipping demand. I mean there could be some out there, but they're not visible to us. So I would say in general, we're shipping consistent with demand and inventory levels are very low or there still could be some areas that inventories continuing to be reduced. I know one area that -- I don't that I would draw -- underscore anything in terms of what we're seeing this quarter but I know for example in the third quarter, communications infrastructure was an area that we highlighted was experiencing some inventory reduction. Probably another one that I would highlight is distribution this quarter. And I guess I would note that resales from distribution we expected to decline this quarter but at this point, it looks like distributors could also reduce some inventory. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. But at this point, we would expect they're going to reduce some inventory. Do you have a follow-on, James?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I do. That was helpful. And then kind of going back to Ross' question about the attach rates of the pull through, as we look at the wind down of the OMAP and connectivity segments in certain areas, when you look back on the history or lessons learned from the baseband wind down, do you did you see any reduction in pull through or attach rates on Analog in those segments? Or did you see pretty steady share in with the customers or the SKUs that you wound down with baseband?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, I'm not aware that there was any notable shift in our penetration in those customer systems where we have baseband that then, when we got out of the baseband, we saw declines in other product lines. So I would say in the case of baseband, practically no, if any, impact. And we would expect similar with the Analog products and the OMAP connectivity. In fact again, we have -- we do have good Analog content in many of the OMAP systems, but we can also find customer systems that don't use our OMAP product at all where our Analog content was just as high. So again I think for the most part, we would have to say those Analog sockets are won individually and they tie very little directly to the OMAP processor. Okay, Jim, thank you.
Operator
And our next caller is Tore Svanberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Could you just give us an update this quarter about any shutdowns that you're planning or just any color at all on your manufacturing?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I don't -- the shutdowns and idling that occur through the course of the holiday period will vary from factory to factory as it does every year. And that will just depend upon demand, et cetera, for particular products that are manufactured in those factories. So some we certainly will be idling through the course of the holidays as we typically do. And by the way, that's just a means by which we can most cost effectively manage when we have open capacity such as we do. So that's just a means by which we handle lower levels of utilization cost effectively. So we will be doing that through the course of these holidays, but it will vary factory by factory. Okay, Tore, do you have a follow-on?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes. Could you also talk a little bit about lead times? If I recall correctly, lead times were fairly short at the beginning of the quarter. Just wondering, have they remained short or any movements at all there?
Ron Slaymaker
Really no movements of significance at all. So I would say lead times overall remain very short with the strong majority continuing to be below 6 weeks for TI. Okay, Tore, thank you.
Operator
And our next caller is Shawn Webster of Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
Kind of on that thread, do you guys expect utilization rates to come up in either Q1 or Q2? And then for your own -- my follow-up question would be for your own inventories, what's your expectation for them in terms of dollars and days in Q4 and maybe in Q1 if you have a view on that?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So maybe you missed, Shawn, this is the fourth quarter mid-quarter update. So I can talk about utilization trends this quarter, which really are consistent with what we expected in October. Utilization will be lower in the fourth quarter compared with third as we reduced new production starts in response to weaker demand. What happens with utilization in first quarter and beyond, I really don't have a lot to comment on at this -- I really have nothing to comment on at this point.
And then in terms of TI's own inventory, I guess I would say in light of our actions to reduce the production levels in our factories that I just described, we would expect that our inventory will decline this quarter. From a day standpoint, it's a little more complex. I would say inventory days, even with the absolute reduction in inventory, you could see days still drift up a little and that's just in consideration that revenue will also decline in the quarter. Shawn, I believe that was your first question -- first 2 questions. Do you have a follow-on?
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
Yes. In terms of your -- it sounds like your expenses are doing a little bit better. Can you remind us in terms of the OpEx linearity, it normally comes up in Q1 and then partially in Q2, is that the normal linearity? And I'm talking normal, I know you have restructuring going on, which is kind of bringing it down.
Ron Slaymaker
So good point, Shawn. OpEx typically is down in Q4 seasonally, and that really just reflects that more vacation time and holiday time is taken in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter and then that will reverse itself in the first quarter typically as less holiday and vacation time occurs. And then the other consideration in the first quarter is that the annual pay and benefit increases are implemented in the month of February. So usually from a seasonal standpoint, we see some increase in OpEx in the first quarter as well. Okay, Shawn, and I didn't mean to give you 3 questions there, but I'm glad you appreciate that.
Operator
Our next caller is Chris Caso of Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
I wonder if you can expand a little bit on some of the comments you made about inventory in the channel. And we also heard from one of your competitors who recently thought that there was some destocking going on. Do you have any metrics that you could share with us in terms of where we are relative to normal levels? And just looking forward, just comment on perhaps the sustainability of the channel inventory at these levels, even taking into account where the levels of demand are right now.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So what I would say is if you'd listen to us those past few quarters, we've been running 6.5 weeks or so over the last few quarters. That is a lean inventory level. We've characterize that, that way. That's lean by historic standards and that's lean even comprehending that we are carrying some of what historically was distributor inventory on TI's books as consignment inventory. Okay. So again, a couple things have happened. Inventories are lean, but we've also implemented the consignment program. But even adjusting for that, they were lean. I really don't want to give you any kind of specific projection on the fourth quarter other than we could see a few more days come out of that inventory level. And it's at this point, the data usually is not very predictive of the full quarter. But I would say we, at this point, probably would be expecting to see a few more days of inventory come out of distribution. Is that sustainable? I don't believe so. I think in general, the channel inventories and to the insight we have at customers, I would say we believe inventory levels are lean and therefore, from a risk standpoint, it's probably somewhat asymmetric. They are lean relative in consideration of the weak environment. But if there's any growth that starts to occur again, we would fully expect replenishment to occur both in distribution, as well as at customers that carry their own inventory. So again, the lean inventories that are there reflect economic uncertainty and relatively weak demand currently. But clearly, there will be replenishment if growth is to occur again. Okay, Chris, thank you.
Operator
Our next caller is Romit Shah of Nomura.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Just to clarify, did you say your lead times are 4 to 5 weeks right now?
Ron Slaymaker
I said the strong majority of our leads times are 6 weeks or less.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
So if the channel is carrying about 6 weeks, then I understand that it's lean from a historical perspective, but isn't that sufficient given where your lead times are? What would be the incentive for them to restock?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, it's -- that's a kind of false impression that pulls everybody in. So it's fine if lead times and everything are totally stable. And, Romit, we are from the standpoint of positioning our own inventory and all that and certainly our capacity, we try to keep it positioned such that we will be able to maintain lead times short. But more generally in our industry, short lead times occur in the trough of the cycle or during relatively weak periods. And then when customer demand starts to come back, lead times tend to extend and that causes customer demand to get even more heated as customers then try to replenish inventory. So do I believe more broadly in the industry that current inventory levels and current lead times are sustainable? No way. And we'll see. That's only just based on 30 years of semiconductor industry history that I have. Maybe this time will be different, but I wouldn't bet on it. Okay, Romit, do you have a follow-on?
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Yes. That's helpful. I was hoping you could just talk specifically about common infrastructure to the big business for you guys. And on one hand, we're hearing about AT&T spending more capital but at the same time, you guys are talking about a reduction in inventory. So maybe just some specifics on what you're seeing from the comm infrastructure space and if you could segment it by geography, that will be helpful.
Ron Slaymaker
I probably don't have a lot to say there other than U.S., Europe, China all being weak, as I said previously. We believe that when I just look at TI's revenue trends this quarter, they're very consistent with what we believe the card shipments are from the equipment providers overall. So I don't -- there could be, as I said, some component inventory reduction but there's not a big distinct difference between what we're seeing with our shipments and what we believe is happening in terms of shipments to the operators currently. So I realize there are operators that have forecast more capital spending, et cetera, but I think that's still likely ahead of us as opposed to anything that's impacting our business this quarter. Okay, Romit, thank you for your questions and, Operator, we have time for one final caller.
Operator
Certainly, and that will come from David Wong of Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
So, Ron, the cost savings that you get from your exit of the Wireless business, as 2013 progresses, do you actually manage to reduce in absolute terms your operating expenses? Or do they keep rising because you have other things you're investing in?
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, you mean for TI?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes, for TI as a whole.
Ron Slaymaker
Boy, that -- David, I don't want to try to project that. I mean, they're -- I think you're seeing TI manage our expenses overall pretty tightly and I think you will continue to see that going forward. The $450 million, what I can assure you is that $450 million is not just moving out of our Wireless segment into other parts of TI. These are costs that are leading Texas Instruments. So I think you would -- if you consider how much we're spending in operating expense currently, we probably -- that probably would clearly translate to a net reduction. But again, the only thing we're really forecasting here is what we're doing inside of our Wireless segment and I'll provide you the assurance as those costs are truly leading TI as opposed to just shifting somewhere else inside of TI. Do you have a follow-on, David?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes. The connectivity products you're exiting, are they manufactured in-house? And if so, what percentage of manufacturing do these currently represent?
Ron Slaymaker
What I would say is in both of these areas, connectivity and OMAP, most of the production is done through third party foundries. So as we exit these, this will really -- this will not have an impact on capacity utilization. We will not have traded capacity as a result of this action.
Okay. And with that, we will go ahead and wrap up. What I will say is before we end the call, let me remind you there's a replay available on our website. Thank you, and good evening.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you again for your participation.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for December 10. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.
Let me start with market environment. Revenue in the third quarter was in the upper half of our range of expectations. That being said, we expected revenue and demand to be weak, and they were. Similarly, our expectations is that this market weakness will carry forward into the fourth quarter as customers respond to the sluggish macro environment and to poor demand for their products. We continue to believe that inventory levels at OEMs and our distribution channels remain low. Although there could be some adjustments to inventory in light of weak demand, we believe this slowdown is being driven by poor end demand, not a broad inventory adjustment.
Even in the weak demand environment, our operations have performed well. We were highly responsive to changing demand and lowered our production loadings accordingly, resulting in lower TI inventory. We remain watchful and ready to respond to changes in demand, up or down, in this uncertain environment. Our lead times are short, our inventory is well-positioned and our factories are highly flexible. We also reduced expenses as we described at our September update.
EPS was $0.67 last quarter. This was favorably impacted by a couple of items in the quarter that Kevin will walk through in detail. These items include a benefit for taxes that contributed $0.14 to EPS and a benefit for changes that we made to our Japan pension program that contributed $0.08 to EPS. Neither of these items was comprehended in the guidance we had provided. In any event, we delivered a solid EPS result that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05, even allowing for these items.
We also generated a lot of cash in the quarter, with free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Kevin will describe how our opportunistic purchases of capacity over the past few years are now benefiting us on this front.
Let me now walk through the third quarter's results. Revenue of $3.39 billion declined 2% from a year ago and grew 2% sequentially. Analog revenue grew 18% from a year ago and was up 2% sequentially. The growth from a year ago was due to the acquisition of National Semiconductor late in the year-ago quarter. Therefore, the revenue comparison only included a week or so of this revenue in the year-ago quarter. The sequential growth was primarily driven by growth in High Volume Analog & Logic, as well as Power Management, offsetting declines in High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog.
I should note that we will soon complete our IT systems integration work at SVA and will begin this quarter to implement a consignment inventory program with distribution on the SVA portfolio. As you will recall, we began to implement a consignment inventory program with distribution in 2008, and our experience has been good in that it creates supply chain efficiencies. In short, it allows the distributors' resources to be better optimized on revenue creation for TI products as a result of fewer resources being tied up in inventory carrying costs. For TI, we believe it translates to higher share at our distributors.
Revenue per products that are on consignment gets recognized as the distributors pull the products from the hub shortly before they ship to their customers. This means that as we convert part of the SVA portfolio to consignment, revenue recognition for these products will flip out about 2 or 3 months as distributors work down their existing inventory and then start pulling from the consignment hub. In total, about $100 million of SVA revenue will be impacted as we move these products to consignment support over a 2 to 3-quarter period. Since we recognize revenue on a sell-in basis to distribution, during this conversion process, the SVA revenue growth will be negatively impacted. Of course, this is only a timing consideration and will have no effect on resales. It will have minimal impact on TI's overall growth rate. However, it will have a more meaningful impact on SVA growth over this conversion period.
Embedded Processing declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue from products sold into communications infrastructure applications. Automotive and catalog products were both up from a year ago. Sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 2%, driven by catalog products as communications infrastructure products declined and automotive was even.
Wireless revenue declined 44% from a year ago and declined 5% sequentially. Baseband revenue was the biggest factor in both comparisons, falling to $54 million in the quarter. Connectivity revenue declined in both comparisons while OMAP revenue increased.
Our Other segment revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 3% sequentially. From a year ago, revenue declined due to lower DLP revenue, the expiration of transitional supply agreements and lower calculator revenue. The sequential increase was due to $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in the quarter that we discussed in our September update, and that was included in our prior guidance. The sequential increase was also driven by higher royalties and calculator revenue. Partially offsetting these increases was lower DLP and custom ASIC revenue.
In distribution, resales were about even with the second quarter, and their TI inventory was essentially unchanged. Distributor's TI inventory remains at just under 6.5 weeks.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. As usual, let me start by walking through some of the charges and benefits in the quarter that were included in our reported results. Acquisition charges in the third quarter were $106 million. In the prior quarter, acquisition charges were $104 million. We recorded charges on the restructuring charges and other line of our income statement of $22 million associated with the previously announced planned closure or potential sale of several older factories. In addition, we had a benefit on this same line of $144 million for change to a pension program in Japan.
Let me briefly explain the pension change. Defined contribution pension plans in Japan have historically provided for both a corporate pension benefit and a government-mandated Social Security type of benefit. The Japanese government has made an option available for companies that provide defined benefit pension plans to return to the government the mandated portion of the pension plan. Under the rules of this option, the pension liabilities we were required to return to the government exceeded the associated assets. The results -- this resulted in a gain to the company, which we recognized in the quarter.
Let me also address the tax benefit. There were a couple of parts to this. The first was a $90 million discrete tax benefit that was primarily the result of an additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to the years 2007 to 2011. The second part, a $67 million benefit, was due to lowering our estimated effective tax rate for the year from 26% to 22% and the associated cumulative adjustment. Most of these rate change was tied to an increase in the impact of non-U.S. effective tax rates, a change that should continue to benefit TI in the years ahead. The EPS impact on these items was as follows: the acquisition and restructuring charges negatively impacted EPS by $0.07 as we had expected; the tax items benefited EPS by $0.14 and the changes to our Japan pension program benefited EPS by $0.08.
Gross profit of $1.74 billion was 51.3% of revenue and increased 5% sequentially. Gross profit resulted from higher revenue, specifically due to the benefit that the $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds provided to our mix of revenue. Operating expenses of $916 million declined 2% from the second quarter. Other income and expense was $24 million of income this quarter, mostly attributable to gains from an equity investment. Net income in the third quarter was $784 million or $0.67 per share on a GAAP basis. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the third quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $14 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.69.
Let me make a few comments on our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion, up $526 million from the prior quarter. Free cash flow was $1.05 billion, up $523 million from the prior quarter. Our free cash flow was benefiting from having operations that are already well positioned for future growth. Accordingly, capital expenditures were $149 million in the quarter, up $3 million from the prior quarter. Our capital expenditures year-to-date are 4% of revenue, at the very low end of our targeted range of 4% to 7% of revenue. We believe we can continue to operate at the low end of this range for several years given our strong capacity position that resulted from our opportunistic purchases of the past few years. As we fill up this low-priced capacity, the resultant cash flow should be strong.
We used $500 million of cash to repay all of our remaining commercial paper in the quarter. We also issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter, consisting of $750 million of 3-year notes at a coupon rate of 0.45% and $750 million of 7-year notes with a coupon rate of 1.65%. At the time we issued the debt, these were the lowest ever corporate coupons for notes of these durations. More than 2 months later, these records still hold. Given these historically low rates, we are confident that we will be able to generate solid shareholder returns over time by using these funds for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. We used $600 million in the quarter to repurchase 20.6 million shares of TI common stock. We repurchased more than twice the number of shares we bought in the prior quarter. We also paid dividends in the quarter of $194 million.
We lowered our inventory by $37 million in the quarter. Inventory days were unchanged at 101. Orders of $3.2 billion in the quarter decreased $171 million or 5% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio declined to 0.96 in the quarter from 1.02 last quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion in the fourth quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would decline 13% from the third quarter. Please remember that our calculated revenue typically seasonally declines in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect about a $100 million decline, which would negatively impact the company's growth by about 3 percentage points. Also, the $60 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in the third quarter was the final Japan earthquake settlement, which, therefore, will not recur. This additionally impacts our fourth quarter growth by a couple of percentage points.
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.31. We expect the fourth quarter's EPS results will be negatively affected by about $0.06 from acquisition and restructuring charges, assuming the company's marginal tax rate of 35%. For the year, our estimate for R&D expense remains $1.9 billion. Our estimate for capital expenditures has been lowered to about $500 million from our prior estimate of $700 million. We estimate -- effective tax rate has been reduced to 22%, down from our prior estimate of 26%.
In summary, our market has weakened, and we expect it will remain so in the fourth quarter as the overall world economy continues to be soft. Especially in this environment, our operations have executed well as we have reduced inventory and lowered expenses in the quarter. Our business model is now focused to squarely on Analog and Embedded Processing, 2 markets with proven histories of solid cash flows and investment returns.
We realized there are questions regarding our plans for OMAP and Connectivity products sold into the smartphone and tablets spaces. I can tell you, we are actively working on these plans, but at this point in time, we don't have anything new to share with you.
Our free cash flow in excess of $1 billion in the third quarter is a testament both to the business model and to the benefits of our opportunistic purchases of manufacturing equipment over the past few years. The benefits to our shareholders of this business model and as long-term cash generation potential are very tangible as we repurchased $600 million of common stock in the quarter, pay dividends of $194 million and announced a 24% increase in our dividend rate. We remain focused on delivering to this potential.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
"
2012-10-22,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]  We will take our first question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I guess the question is kind of a strategic one to start, which is that understanding that a lot of the capacity you have is very strategic and that it's not going to go obsolete. How much lower would the cycle have to get or how much longer would the cycle have to stay at these depressed levels before the company would thinking about -- would think about, taking actions to mitigate some of the short-term capacity and maybe put some margin leverage back in the model?
Kevin P. March
Jim, we don't have any more plans to take any more capacity offline than what we already announced. And what we announced back in the first quarter on the general earnings release was that we would be closing 2 older factories. That's the one in Hiji, Japan and one in Houston, Texas. We expect the factories to close late in the first half of 2013, one of them, and the other one early in the second half of 2013. Right now, our focus is on maintaining the state-of-the-art factories because frankly, their cost is quite low and go ahead and take these older, less economically advantaged factories offline. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, if I could, I'm sorry if I missed it during the prepared remarks. But the factory loadings in Q4 and/or any thoughts about inventory for Q4?
Kevin P. March
The factory loadings in Q3 declined quarter-over-quarter, and so consequently, our underutilization charges did increase. With our reduced outlook for fourth quarter, we're further reducing our factory loadings into the fourth quarter. I won't predict where our inventory actually lands at, but I will point out that we do expect the factory loadings to decrease further in the fourth quarter, which also means our underutilization charges are expected to increase in the fourth quarter as well.

Our next caller is CJ Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide some color around gross margin and OpEx. And I guess within that, you talked about an effective tax rate for the full year of 22% now. So we'd be thinking therefore around 32% in Q4 or if you can provide some help there as well?
Kevin P. March
CJ, there's a couple of things in them, let me make sure I get to them all. But the tax rate, we expect to be 22% in the fourth quarter and going forward, starting from that 22% tax rate, as you build your models and you look out into the future for TI and you try to model our earnings, you should tax the incremental profit at 35% and let that fall through to the implied tax rate for 2013. As it relates to gross margin, gross margin in the quarter was 51.3% of the company level, but I'll remind you that we did have a $60 million insurance reimbursement that came through in the quarter. So that definitely benefited the gross margin a little bit in the quarter. As it relates to your question on OpEx, we did bring OpEx down in the quarter. I believe overall, we're down about $20 million quarter-over-quarter. And as we look out in the fourth quarter, I would expect we would continue to bring OpEx down especially in light of a weaker demand outlook that we've given our guidance.
Ron Slaymaker
So CJ, let me just clarify also. The lower effective tax rate, we made the adjustments in the third quarter that would cumulatively get the year to that tax rate. So therefore, fourth quarter, our expectation is that it would be at that 22% effective tax rate, barring any other additional discrete items. Do you have a follow-on, CJ?
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Yes, one quick one. You talked about the consignment inventory program with SVA. How should we think about, I guess, the impact to revenues from that line item over the next quarter or 2 as that gets built into the model?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I don't have a quarter-by-quarter guidance to give you. But what we said was it would be about $100 million in total, that will convert over to the program. And at any point in time, the revenue that is converting basically will shift out about 2 to 3 quarters. So as we step -- I'm sorry, 2 to 3 months, and it will move out about 2 to 3 months and we will complete the entire conversion process of that $100 million in 2 to 3 quarters time period. So again, as we, let's say if in the first quarter, just as an example, please don't take this as specific guidance. If we were to convert $40 million of SVA revenue over to this consignment support, basically that $40 million would not be in that first quarter in this upcoming quarter but would move out to the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, into the first quarter. And then to the extent that we took additional revenue and converted over to consignment, let's say $50 million or $60 million in the following quarter, then there would be another $10 million to $20 million, depending upon the actual amount of additional headwind in that quarter. So again, during the process in which we're converting, so that 2- to 3-quarter time period, there will be a headwind in potentially sequential growth and certainly in year-on-year growth comparisons for SVA. And again, the total amount at the TI level will be pretty minimal. But if you're just looking at the SVA product line, it will be a more meaningful impact to that business.
Operator
And we'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
You don't want to get into the restructuring on wireless, but can you talk just in general about the operating expense for next year as you think about taking some of the R&D out focused on some of the big vertical markets and focusing on embedded. What's the overall impact on your operating expense structure?
Kevin P. March
Joe, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, there are probably quite a few questions on our plans for the OMAP and Connectivity products as it relates to wireless handsets and tablets, and we don't have any additional comments to give you on that right now as we're working through those plans. But as soon as we do, we will share those with everybody. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Sure, then I'll try a separate question. The dividend increase that you did in the quarter, can you talk about what drove the decision to do that and how you think about uses of cash between the buyback and dividend increases and other opportunities?
Kevin P. March
Sure. I think the decision to increase is really a function of the emerging model for TI as it continues to evolve, and that is even if you take a look at the most recent quarter, about 70% of our revenues were coming from our Analog and Embedded Processing technologies and business units. And those are areas that not only enjoy a relatively robust margins but, because of the R&D and manufacturing nature of those products, produce very robust levels of cash. And as we have been committed to for a long time, we continue to return that cash to our shareholders in the form of those dividends and stock buybacks, and that increase just represents the ongoing confidence of that business model continue to produce that kind of free cash flow in the future.
Operator
We will take our next question from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
In terms of the revenue guidance, even if I subtract the impact of, I guess it's about $260 million from all of the things coming and going, you still appear to be guiding substantially below the book-to-bill. Can you just tell us if there's anything else going on in there? And then also, how will that impact what would be normal seasonality in Q1 or how should we be thinking about Q1?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, I don't know that -- I think book-to-bill is a -- is one consideration in guidance. Certainly, we look at orders, we look at order trends. One thing I would note that is when we look at order linearity through the course of the quarter, the month of September was the lowest month in the quarter. So that called the trend of orders as we move through the third quarter was a consideration. But, Chris, the other thing I would just is recall that only about 60% of TI's revenue operates on traditional backlog and order entry process. We've got about 40% of our revenue that is supported by consignment programs. And so with the consignment programs, we're getting the forecast information from those customers, but it doesn't show up as an order until the customer actually is ready to take the product or for us to ship the product. So again, orders are part of the story but they're not the whole story there. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes, so you guys are guiding for a pretty tough environment in Q4. It's been tough all year. If this environment persists i.e. if this was the new normal, what -- where or what could you guys do in terms of capacity and OpEx to shore it up a little bit?
Kevin P. March
Chris, I think Jim asked earlier about any capacity considerations that we have and sort of addressed that one, I won't repeat that one. On the OpEx front, as I mentioned early on also, we will be expecting to take tighter controls on that certainly as we go to 4Q and reduced outlook. And we'll continue to manage Opex as we traditionally do to what our revenue outlook is. And so to the extent that the revenue continues to be a challenging environment, we'll continue to manage OpEx in a very tight fashion. I think it's about all I can really give you for color on that right now.
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, I mean, again, we talked about the capacity side. But if your mindset is that Q4 very well might be the new normal, I would just say you're much more pessimistic than TI is about our long-term outlook for our business. I think we view or going through a rough patch for the economy overall, but by no means do we translate that to the new normal for Texas Instruments.
Operator
And our next caller is Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Just one clarification. I'm curious why operating margins in your Other segment were so high, I think over 50% of sales. Was there anything special in that segment this quarter?
Kevin P. March
Yes, in the Other segment is where we book these nonrecurring items. So for example  the gain that we had on the Japan pitch plan of $140 million -- $144 million was booked into that segment, and also the recovery we had on the business interruption insurance was booked to that segment. So that's another $60 million you saw go in there. So clearly, the 2 of those combined is going to bump up that operating margin percent pretty handsomely.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
All right. And then the main question is if I look at your core Analog business and if you look at the profitability of that business, just apples-to-apples, how does it compare with what a linear or an Analog devices or a Maxim are doing? Do you think your margins are comparable? If not, why not? I understand that there's a capacity utilization aspect, but what can you do to get close to the profitability of those other companies?
Kevin P. March
I think the publicly reported results of those companies actually show the benefit of the model that we've been trying to develop for TI overall, because it certainly produced very, very high and attractive margins, very low capital intensity and still generate lots of cash. Probably one of the larger differences between TI today and most of our Analog competitors is that we have quite a bit more available capacity than they do. And so clearly, our various segments, including our Analog segment, is experiencing portions of the end utilization charge that we've got as a result of that capacity. But we also believe that with our continuing share gains, and I might mention we do believe we have been gaining share again this year in Analog, that we would expect to fill up that capacity, and so that capacity continues to be quite valuable to our strategic plans as we look forward.
Ron Slaymaker
And, Vivek, I would also just add, when you take the products that TI has in our portfolio and if you compare them to any of those competitors that you might choose, I think our margins are probably very comparable, with the exception of underutilization differences here or there. But in general, the margins that we have for comparable products are very similar to that of our competitors is what I suspect because our pricing strategies are similar. It's not our objective to go out and underprice. It's not our objective to overprice. It's basically price the product competitively, and then try to win on features and performance and support that we can offer that customer. And I think from a cost standpoint, a manufacturing cost standpoint, put our costs probably up against any manufacturers in the world in terms of Analog. So I think that bigger difference, when you look at our business overall, is just that we are a much larger player than any of the companies that you named. And when you -- your strategy is to, as it is in some of those cases, is just to run just a very high gross margin business and be selective only for those pieces of business that support that gross margin, that's a fine strategy for that particular company, but it's going to result in a lower revenue level. Our strategy is to generate a very large Analog business that will generate a very attractive cash flow, and that means we're going to participate in a broader spectrum of business than what some of those more narrow competitors would be. So I would suggest probably that's the bigger difference, and in fact, when we go head-to-head with comparable products to those various competitors, margins are probably very similar.
Operator
And we'll go next to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I apologize if you mentioned this, but given that we kind of view the core revenue stream a little bit different from the wireless revenue stream, can you talk a little bit about, relative to the overall guide for December, kind of how you see wireless trending sequentially and if there's any significant changes with the components inside of wireless?
Kevin P. March
John, I think with wireless, we just recorded this, if you think of the 3 pieces inside, then you got OMAP, Connectivity and baseband. Baseband just reported about $54 million in the third quarter, and we expect that to be probably about the same in fourth quarter. As for the rest of wireless, going into those areas, probably going to be sub-$200 million is what we expect in the fourth quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
And that's OMAP Connectivity in third quarter were $270 million, so probably dipping more so than the company overall. And even though we don't generally give guidance further out, we told you for some time that baseband will continue to decline and essentially be gone in 2013. Our expectation is that flat fourth quarter and then probably cut in half sequentially as we roll in the first quarter. And at that point, we're down below 1% of TI's total revenue. So essentially down to 0. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes, Ron, just relative to your answer to Chris about the disconnect between book-to-bill in September quarter versus guide in December. I think you said September was the worst month of the September quarter. Just kind of curious, as we look in here to October, have you guys found the bottom yet in the business or how would you kind of characterize the start to this quarter versus the finish of the last quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
John, I don't -- I would say it is running very consistent with the outlook that we provided. We're not -- it's not a big bounce-back that's would cause us to question the numbers we've given nor has it deteriorated such to the point that whether we question those numbers again. So again, probably no real trend change in the month of October that would cause us to revisit one or the other. I guess one thing I could point out, and this is not so much for the month of October, but if you just look back at third quarter, another metric -- we look at our cancellations, and cancellations in the quarter actually were down sequentially. And I would say would be down below what we would consider normal levels. So when we take that data and put it together, we had a small upside in the quarter, it really just kind of points to that view that we have customers and distributors really running lean levels of inventory and continuing to provide us short visibility in orders that they placed in the form of backlog. So at the same time, we're in a position where our lead times are short, our inventory is sufficient. It allows us to operate well in that environment, but it's the nature of the market environment we're operating in.

And we'll take our next caller, Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
For the third one around wireless, I know you don't -- you're not prepared to give any guidance on what you're going to do. But in general, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how easy it actually is to separate out the embedded portion of OMAP and Connectivity from the more traditional wireless? How easy is it to separate those 2 disparate R&D organizations, and how does the R&D intensity between those 2 actually look?
Kevin P. March
Yes, the separation, certainly from a product standpoint, is fairly straightforward. But as you point out, from an R&D standpoint, the engineering teams, that's a bit more of an effort. There are some people devoted exclusively to the Embedded Processing applications of those technologies as opposed to the wireless or the tablet and cellphone applications. And there are some engineering teams that actually cross both areas because there's some commonality. But that's the one that's probably a little more challenging to -- for realignment purposes. As it relates to -- on a go-forward basis, the separation, the -- we find that business is under way. But again, we'll report on that when we have a little bit more behind us in the future.
Ron Slaymaker
Stacy, probably one thing I could add because I think you were just saying, you're asking not specific plans but how does the R&D intensity on the embedded side compare with the R&D intensity on -- for smartphones and tablets. And the answer is it's less on the embedded side. Our -- what we found thus far is that OMAP and Connectivity for embedded applications looks a lot like our other embedded product lines in many ways from an R&D perspective. So for example, a lot of the R&D that we spend on the embedded side is focused on creating derivative, basically looking at different -- just interfaces, et cetera, that you put around on packaging, various qualification options, a lot more in the form of application nodes, software as opposed to in smartphones and tablets where you're on a pretty rapid cadence of introducing a completely new architecture generation. So that part can slow down, and you focus more on spinning off derivative product investment. So from that standpoint, R&D on the embedded side of OMAP and Connectivity is a lower investment than what's needed on the smartphone and tablet side. Do you have a follow-on there, Stacy?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Just very briefly, last quarter when it came time to talk about what Q4 seasonality looked like, you actually gave the details of a calculation correcting for Nat Semi, correcting for base and roll-off, and I think you even posted the details on the website. Could you give me -- give us an idea of what that same calculation actually would look like just on a historical basis for Q1?
Ron Slaymaker
For Q1? Sure. It is basically flat. It really is flat. So I think if you just do a 5-year average, you would see TI revenue down 4%. But that includes a pretty dramatic drop in the first quarter of 2009. So I exclude that as an outlier. Basically, I get TI revenue flat fourth quarter to first. And that holds true for our calculator business as well as business overall. So we don't have any kind of significant calculator seasonality in Q1 that would affect us the way it does in Q4. Okay, Stacy? And again, to your point, that's not -- if you go back and look at the record books, that's not necessarily a -- as a reported number. That is including SVA historical revenue and excluding baseband, and we make both of those adjustments really to try to mirror what our current portfolio looks like and what those historical trends might tell you about revenue trends on a go-forward basis.
Operator
And we'll go next to Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
If I look at the sequential decline that you've provided for the fourth quarter, and I recognized there are some puts and takes in there that we can adjust for. It's still amounts to the third worst sequential decline for TI in the last 10 years. I think it's the sixth worst sequential decline for the company in the last 20 years. I wonder if you can talk about, in light of those facts, talk about what you think may be different than how things were in the past periods when things got this bad? Is it different? Is it the same? How has the environment changed?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Mr. Sunshine, I'll let Kevin answer your question.
Kevin P. March
Okay. Glen, I think that, just from a macro standpoint, certainly there's a lot of -- we just kind of surveyed the global environment. We're looking that -- in the U.S., you got a fiscal cliff that people are wondering what's going to wind up happening. You got a potential change in many people in the national government and lots of discussion about regulatory and tax changes, and that's certainly causing people to kind of sit on the sidelines and perhaps wait and see what new rules are going to be. In China, you got this similar sort of thing and they've got a once in 10-year change in their government happening this fall. And you got to imagine that those business people have a similar perspective that some of the rules may change with the new government, and so therefore they would also be inclined to slow down much the same way as we see here in the Americas. And finally, in Europe, again similar. Everybody knows there's a serious debt problem that must be addressed, and that's going to require some meaningful change, certainly in the tax environment and other regulatory elements there. You can imagine a similar sort of thing there. So I'd say that if I tried to compare this environment to some of those doom and gloom ones that you just alluded to in the last 10 years or more, these are certainly 3 examples of things that are probably quite different from any time during those past 10 years.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes, it kind of relates to the first one because actually in those doom and gloom periods, what's interesting is that they don't last all that long. And one that would argue actually that maybe there's a recovery that's coming in the next couple of quarters. I want -- I'd say that, and on the other hand, I hear from some of these industrial companies, not chip companies, that we could be in this kind of environment for the next 4, 5, 6 quarters. I wonder when you think about 2013 and how you're shaping the business, the cost structure for the business, are you sort of gearing for a flattish kind of environment just to be on the safe side? Or are you hoping that there's -- are you thinking that there's some kind of recovery that's bound to happen given how bad things are now?
Ron Slaymaker
And before Kevin answers the question on kind of what we might be thinking about in costs, et cetera, let me just remind that if we go back to late fourth quarter, late 2008, early 2009, how many of us, as we were going into that downturn, thought we were entering into a multi-year period of weakness. And it lasted 2 quarters, and we were back up to the races again. So I think we all need to be aware of how wrong we've been in the past and what that might say about where we are today. Kevin?
Kevin P. March
I think Ron just said it. What I'm about to say is going to be wrong. Let me just say that clearly, what we have done, Glen, is anticipate that we're going to grow TI whether or not the economy rose and prices along with it, will we grow because we're able to compete more successfully against our competitors with better product and better manufacturing remains to be seen. But that's why we invested in the manufacturing capacity that we have, and it's already bought and paid for. So even if we do wind up with a flat environment that's unattractive or a very strong growth environment that's very attractive, our manufacturing footprint is taken care of. Our CapEx bill is basically behind us, and so the result should be either -- whether result of growth is going to be very nice in the bottom line but certainly to the cash generation that, that will deliver for us. As it relates on the OpEx front, clearly in the near term, we're slowing down OpEx expenditures in light of the revenue environment that we're looking at. And we'll look into them and manage those pretty tightly. You may recall that we had talked in the past the model that we have for OpEx was that in periods of relatively weak revenue growth, our OpEx is probably going to be pushing up towards 30%. And in periods of stronger revenue growth, our OpEx will slide down closer to 20%. We're just -- we're probably in the mid to upper 20s right now, and we'll have to see where we'll go. But we will be operating with Opex inside those ranges, and we'll just see where the revenue outlook actually takes us and adjust accordingly.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Back to the SVA side and the conversion to consignment, can you give us a ballpark of the absolute revenues for SVA? And in your fourth quarter guidance, are you assuming that, that consignment transaction or transition actually hits the revenues starting in the fourth quarter there?
Ron Slaymaker
It will begin in fourth quarter. So it will have an impact on revenues in fourth quarter, and that's fully comprehended to the extent we have it in our guidance. Also, in terms of the SVA side, first half of this year, I don't have this updated through third quarter, but first half of this year, SVA was about 20% of our overall Analog revenue. So you can scale it from there. So a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, switching gears to the often forgotten Other category, it seemed like you guys had a couple of things going very well in that, with insurance and calculators. So it seems to be up roughly $90 million, $100 million sequentially, but the whole segment only grew I think $18 million sequentially. So it seems like there was a big drop-off in something else. Can you just talk through what happened in the other parts of Other?
Kevin P. March
Yes, on a -- certainly, the business interruption was up. You're talking about the revenues, so that's the business interruption insurance that went through the revenue line, driving that up, and that was offset by DLP being down and ASIC being down on a sequential basis. Those are the 3 main moving parts inside there.
Operator
And we'll take our next caller, Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
This one's for Kevin. Kevin, if I take out the insurance proceeds, the gross margin was still up sequentially, yet your production was down. So are we just looking at an improving mix here?
Kevin P. March
Yes.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Is that all I get?
Kevin P. March
Yes.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, that was easy. You have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes, and this one's for you, Ron. You mentioned that what you're expecting in Q4 is basically customer demand being down, yet you're giving a very wide range. So what are some of the moving parts here as far as your customers are concerned? Because again, you're saying there's no inventory adjustment, this is just true demand. So I'm just wondering why the wide range?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, that's pretty straightforward, Tore, and it has to do with lead times that are running short. This isn't a case where lead times are on average 12 weeks. We would come into the quarter with the quarter pretty much fully booked. In this case, lead times are very short, and so there really is a, based upon our backlog, the backlog is not the full story. So things could turn out better than what we have at the middle of our guidance range or they could turn out worse, and that's why we give a range of revenue guidance. But especially in an environment like this where there's just a lot of moving pieces going on with the overall economic situation, as Kevin pointed out, and our backlog visibility is running short as our lead times.
Operator
And we'll go next to David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
If we look at -- if we back out the effect of the accounting changes, do you expect that your Silicon Valley Analog performance is going to be better, the same or worse than the rest of your Analog over the next few quarters in terms of year-over-year growth?
Ron Slaymaker
David, I think what we've said for in general, that our assumptions when we were basically running our own internal calculations on a potential financial returns of that acquisition, our assumptions that we build in were that in the first year, SVA would continue to lose market share as it had been pre- acquisition. In the second year, after the acquisition, we expected that we would have it running market neutral. So possibly less than TI's overall Analog business but at least running neutral with the market from a market share standpoint. And then in the third year is when we expect it to have it growing faster than the market and consistent with TI's own Analog business. So our expectation is that we will do that, if not better. Certainly, the first year, it lagged the market. We're coming into that period where again, if you look probably more from a resale perspective where it's unaffected by the consignment conversion, then we would expect that we have SVA growing consistent with the overall market. But also, as you point out, when you look at -- with that conversion, there will be some -- it will grow at a lower rate than what resale should show. Okay, David, and do you have a follow-on question?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes, following your announcement of your strategic plan for OMAP and Connectivity, do you reckon any of your current OMAP or Connectivity business is associated with end-of-life buys?
Kevin P. March
David, we don't have any plans for end-of-life buys. We're going to support customers on whatever products they want to order, and that's the way we'll deal with that, which is typically how we'll deal with these things. When we, in the past, have changed the internal resource focus for other opportunities inside our portfolio, we've continued to honor whatever customers want on the old product, and we'll continue to do that on this as well.

We'll take our next question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
I actually have one quick one, Ron. I don't think you tested the end markets. Where there any end market [indiscernible] we're showing signs with civilization?
Ron Slaymaker
Ambrish, you are not -- I could not hear you. If you could maybe pick up your receiver and repeat your question?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
My question was I don't think you went into the end markets or geographies. You talked about wireless, but what's going on with the specific end markets? Are there any that are showing signs of worse deceleration or any geography that is getting worse or better?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Ambrish. I can walk through it. What I would say is the weakness is pretty broad-based though with a very few exceptions. If we look at the industrial market, I think you've heard from other companies that have reported as well, the industrial market is weak. It affected TI revenue, especially in areas such as Silicon Valley Analog and High Performance Analog. And I think from a regional standpoint, this shows up especially in the U.S. and European regions. Automotive, I would describe as mixed, where U.S. sales of automobile, so in-sales, continue to grow. But if you look at regions like China and Europe, they're declining. If you look at TI's revenue, our automotive revenue in Embedded Processing was even, and our Analog automotive revenue increased a small amount. Moving over to wireless infrastructure, I think as we talked about even at the mid-quarter update, that revenue was weak for TI, a combination of lower purchases by carriers and even adjustments of inventory as a result from OEMs in that space. I think as it affects TI, WCDMA continues to dominate the air standard demand overall, and TI played there strongly. Although you're seeing probably growth, and you've seen this probably in some other companies' reports, on the LTE side, although I would say that spending is a bit volatile or erratic quarter-to-quarter. And again, we play on both WCDMA as well as LTE. From a regional standpoint there, I would say China continues to be weak, as well as slowdowns in the U.S. are contributing to the weakness as well. If you look over in computing, no surprise there. There is a lot of weakness both on the commercial side as well as public spending. Don't know the impact of Windows 8, don't know the impact that tablets are having on cannibalization. All I know is our revenue, as we sold into that space, generally was weak, including in the peripheral space, so meaning hard disk drives and printers. Probably one area of exception would be in our Analog battery management products, that revenue actually was up in PCs and in notebook chargers. But in both cases, that really is due to share gains from TI as opposed to strength in the market. But last story I would mention would be consumer. There, we're seeing seasonal growth really being driven by gaming and audio type of products, backlog visibility there in -- especially into the back-half of Q4 is pretty short, and we expect fourth quarter to see a seasonal decline, again, driven by the same areas. Okay, your question on the geographic split. U.S. was down, Europe was down, Japan was down. The one area that grew was Asia, and of course, Asia is large enough to offset all those other areas because about 2/3 of our revenue ships into Asia. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
I actually do, Ron. Just trying to tie back inventory and what we're hearing from the industrial guys. So for instance, Caterpillar is now talking about their dealers reducing inventory, how does that -- and I've been also of the view that inventory has been lean in the channel, and maybe I'm wrong as well because now that starts getting flushed back into the system. Does that then translate into inventory getting elevated again, specifically in areas like industrial? And any perspective would be helpful, Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
I'm sorry, you're -- Ambrish, you said some of these players are saying their inventory -- their end product inventory needs to be reduced?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Not any reference, specifically referring to Caterpillar, which said that their dealers are reducing inventory, something to that effect. So my question is inventory has been low but now the demand decelerating the way it is, it is the 6, 6.5 weeks at a risk of getting elevated over the next quarter or so?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, I understand. Let me first of all say, when we're talking about inventory, of course, we're referring to inventory of TI components. Generally, even at our OEMs much less for customers that purchased through distributors, we don't have a lot of downstream visibility into their end products and  into their inventory. To the extent -- I think distributors are trying just like TI as to really stay on top of the demand trends and make inventory adjustments on a real-time basis, so that they do not get into an excess situation. I think over the last few quarters, you've heard us talking about distributor inventory holding at about or just below 6.5 weeks I think for 3 quarters now. So -- and clearly, revenues have been shifting around, and we've had a few surprises in that environment. So I guess what I would say is I think distributors, OEM customers, TI, ourselves, we're all trying to just really keep aligned with end demand to avoid inventory going one way or the other. There's just a lot of sensitivity there. So hopefully, we do that going forward.
Operator
And we'll take that final caller, Doug Freedman with RBC.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
When I look at your comments about just the conversation you just started as far as inventories and what's going on, you do have a high consignment turns that you guys execute to. How well is your product output lining up with the customer demand as such? How long can we continue to provide these low lead times before you end up with a mismatch to a forecast that drives some extension there?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I think our goal would be to do it for an extended period of time now. That doesn't always work through, but one of the things you see is that we're running, what, 101 days of inventory? If you compare that back to early '09. I believe we were in the mid-70s or so in terms of days of inventory. So we are carrying a different level of inventory, and part of that is because our portfolio changed. We are much more about standard or catalog product these days where off-the-shelf availability is important. And by the way, the risks of that inventory is also lower because we have lots of different customers that we can sell into with these same products. And typically, these are very long-lived products. So again, just the risk of carrying that inventory is lower. So I would say that's probably our biggest consideration and protection against what you just described, as well as keeping our factories prime to go and flexible up or down. Do you have a follow-on, Doug?
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Yes, I guess my follow-on is really looking at those factories, and I might try to steal Ross' follow-up as well. When you look at your factories in Q4, how many shutdown days do we have, and is there an expectation that you're going to have to keep some shutdown in Q1? And then my Ross' follow-up really is just looking at your forward guidance. You basically have offered us enough numbers on the other and the mobile group. I'm coming up with about 8% to 9% decline sequentially for Embedded Processing and Analog, if you were to guide by group. Does that -- is that computing properly?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, I don't have -- other than the information we provided for you on wireless, I don't have a -- or I'm going to -- not going to break the guidance down segment-by-segment. So that's -- those kinds of assumptions are what you guys get paid to do. In terms of shutdown, obviously, when our utilization goes down and runs low, there are a lot of different methods that we use to maintain the efficiency of our factories. And so shutdowns and idling and scheduling vacation or holiday times and breaks are part of what we do. But I don't have anything to set here and discuss publicly in terms of how we will deal with it other than those are usually part of the mix.
Before we end this call, let me remind you that we have an upcoming investor meeting on November 1 at our Silicon Valley Analog facility in Santa Clara, California. At this meeting, our Analog manager, Brian Crutcher, and his management team will update investors on our strategy for growth in Analog and our execution progress. So if you have not already registered for this meeting, please do so or contact us if you need additional information. Of course, if you're unable to attend the meeting, we will have it webcast live and available on our website. With that, let me thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2012 Mid-Quarter Update Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the third quarter of 2012. In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company. In general, I will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segments or end markets, and I will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information.
As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings from our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $3.27 billion and $3.41 billion, a range that has been narrowed to the middle of our prior range. Although demand for products is in the lower half of our prior range of expectations, we have $60 million of insurance proceeds for business interruption associated with last year's earthquake in Japan, allowing us to narrow our revenue range around the prior midpoint. Since these proceeds are for business interruption, not property damage, they are included as revenue.
We expect earnings per share between $0.38 and $0.42 on a GAAP basis. EPS has moved to the upper half of our prior range due to a couple of considerations. First, lower sequential profit associated with lower product revenue will be more than offset by the high fall-through associated with the insurance proceeds, allowing our earnings to benefit from a favorable revenue mix. Second, we are taking timely actions to reduce costs. Our estimates for acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges are unchanged and are expected to total to about $0.07 per share, assuming TI's marginal tax rate of 35% is applied to these charges.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
"
2012-09-11,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I guess, first question is if you could give any kind of color at all on where you're seeing the relative weakness that would have caused the operating results to be in -- toward the lower end.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Jim. Maybe it's useful to -- let me just kind of walk through where we're seeing both positives and negatives, because they really are a bit of a mix. So although I would describe it as most areas are tracking a little below the middle of our range of expectations, Wireless is actually doing a little better than we had initially expected due to new tablet launches at a couple of customers that use OMAP. Of course, we still expect overall Wireless revenue to decline sequentially as baseband revenue will fall from $90 million last quarter to about $50 million this quarter. And I think we explained that, in terms of expectations on baseband, back in July. Outside of Wireless, though, although we have some product lines that will likely be up sequentially and others that will be down, almost all of them are running a little weaker than what we had expected back in July. So it's probably -- I probably should emphasize also that most of the weakness that we're seeing in third quarter relative to normal seasonality is really what we -- what began back in June and what we had anticipated would continue into third quarter. So for the most part, this is continuation of weakness that began in June, with a little bit lower-than-expected across most product areas, really with the exception of Wireless. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes. In terms of the insurance benefit, I believe we had one of those last quarter, too. Are there any more of those that we might expect in future quarters that we could model in? Or is this the end of that?
Ron Slaymaker
In fact, this is the end of it. So the $60 million that we are receiving this quarter will be our final proceeds for business interruption associated with the Japan earthquake. So just for your record, cumulatively, we received about $170 million in business interruption proceeds, including this quarter's amount. And again, that's specific to the Japan earthquake. We've also received about $40 million total in property damage, and those proceeds are now final as well. So at least with respect to the Japan earthquake, all the insurance proceeds are now behind us.
Operator
Our next caller is Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
I guess, just on the demand picture -- or the revenue picture being a little weaker generally outside of OMAP, is that a demand issue? Is it inventory in the channel? And can you update us on where inventory stands?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Craig, I guess I would suggest that inventory, we believe, remains pretty lean. And I'll talk specifically about distribution inventory in a minute. But if you go back to July, we also allowed at that point that this potentially could be just weaker demand, or alternatively, it could just be that customers were taking advantage of short lead times to potentially get orders at the last minute. And I guess what I would say on that consideration, at this point, we've really concluded we're just operating in a weaker demand environment than would be seasonally normal. As our quarter has progressed, we've seen some of the demand that had initially been scheduled for the months of July and August shipments pushed into September. And I say that because we also, I think, said back in July that our backlog coverage for July and August looked pretty normal from a seasonal standpoint. But the real question mark we had was the month of September, where backlog coverage was lighter. So as the quarter progressed, some of that July, August backlog in fact pushed out into the month of September. But beyond the just shifting of backlog and demand between months, overall product demand for the quarter has also declined a little, as I said a minute ago. With respect to channel inventory, really, we expect distributor inventory to hold at about flat with where it was last quarter, which you'll recall was just under 6.5 weeks. So that remains lean. I guess I should also note that we expect resales from our distribution channel to also be about even sequentially. So flat resales, relatively flat absolute inventory. And then also from a weeks basis, about the same as where we ended up last quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Craig?
Craig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
I do. Can you just comment on whether TI has the right amount of total capacity following the 300-millimeter expansion and National acquisition and your demand commentary? And just update us on utilizations, lead times and underabsorption-related charges.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I'm not sure I can update you on all of that, because I'm not sure I can remember all of it. But let me hit on, do we have the right amount of capacity? And I will interpret that from the standpoint of you're really asking if we have too much capacity. So let me just say, although I think our underutilized capacity, on the one hand, you can draw a line to gross margins and say, ""Hey, it's pressuring gross margins by a few points currently,"" we really view the open capacity more from the standpoint as an opportunity to support our future growth and really not as a headwind to our financials. Because we were able to buy those assets for pennies on the dollar, the impact that lower utilization is having on our income statement really is muted. And in fact, I should add that I think we believe the more important consideration is the benefit that we're seeing today to our free cash flow. And that's really a direct result of the opportunistic capacity investments that we made over the past few years, as we're now spending well below our historical rates on capital. So I'll point you -- specifically, if you look at the first half of this year, our capital expenditures were below 4% of revenue. And if you go look at our history, that's several points below where we ran even just a few years ago. I guess, back to the gross margin consideration, I'll just point out a large part of the impact that underutilization has on gross margin really are associated with noncash charges such as depreciation. So gross margin, in our view, may not be the best metric when evaluating these capacity investments in the short term and at least should be balanced out with the benefits that we're seeing from a free cash flow standpoint. So I know I took a little different direction maybe than what your original question was, but I thought it was important.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Can you just talk about sort of what areas or products you guys are taking the cost out? And is the EPS upside evenly split between the insurance proceeds and the lower costs?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Yes, first of all, I would say, in terms of the type of expense reductions, I don't know that I would try to draw a line to any specific product areas. Think about the expense reductions at this point really just representing general tightening our controls on expenses in a more uncertain environment. So that includes minimizing discretionary spending, keeping hiring to new college graduates, the critical few, those types of things, as opposed to specific product area or segment reductions. And then your other question that tied into that, I guess, was the EPS -- the $0.02 of additional EPS. Think about it as about $0.01 came from the revenue mix benefit, so what you just described as the higher fall-through from the insurance. And then, you're right, about $0.01 of that coming from the cost reductions that we're in the process of implementing. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes, thank you. Can you just talk about how the book-to-bill and backlog are trending this quarter? And remind us what we should be thinking about Q4 as far as normal seasonality.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. In terms of order trends, I would say orders are soft this quarter and likely will be down sequentially from last quarter. From a book-to-bill standpoint, as usual, we'll wait until the end of the quarter to comment on that. And then in terms of fourth quarter, call it, average sequential growth, probably the right number to look at is, if you exclude the fourth quarter '08, we are down, on average, about 4%, and that is a 5-year average. And keep in mind, that down 4% really is all coming from the sequential decline in our calculator business following the third quarter peak back-to-school periods. Semiconductor revenue -- and I realize we don't specifically break the products out that way, but semiconductor revenue historically is flattish third to fourth quarter. But the seasonal decline in calculators pulls us down to about a 4% decline, again excluding the fourth quarter '08 number.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
First of all, Ron, can you talk a little bit about the actual end markets? I think you said all product lines were tracking below seasonality or were a little bit weaker. But as far as end markets are concerned, are you seeing any differences there?
Ron Slaymaker
Not really. I'll kind of walk you through them individually, but probably, the overview is not really. So I'll start with computing. It's weak essentially on every front with the exception of tablets. PCs and associated peripherals are weak. I know there's debate whether this is due to delayed purchases associated with Windows 8 or whether it's due to displacement by tablets. I'm sure there are a few other theories I don't want to weigh in on. So I'll say I don't know why it's weak, but we are seeing notable weakness in the computing and the PC space. Turning to communications, I would describe that also as generally weak. Part of it is TI-specific, of course, because our baseband revenue is taking a pretty good step-down this quarter as we wind down, really in the final stages of that business, now. If you look at comms infrastructure, that revenue will likely also decline this quarter, and I'd really point to maybe 3 different reasons. One is the impact of a carrier in North America that is -- has, in fact, slowed down its orders. The second would be the economic slump in China is now pushing out infrastructure spending. And then the third is that some of our OEM customers are working down some of their excess inventory now. In consumer, we expect our revenue to be sub-seasonal. A couple of examples I can give, television manufacturers, the panel manufacturers, anyway, have now reduced their forecast to a sequential decline. Really, they're pointing to overall economic weakness, as well as high inventory levels. On the other hand, a bright spot, I guess, is game manufacturers are ramping for the upcoming holiday season and seem to be driving some growth there. Automotive, we expect our revenue to be about flat sequentially. And then elsewhere, industrial, I would just say demand is on the weak side. Some of that certainly is seasonal, although there's a lot of just general caution amongst industrial OEMs as well. All right. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes. You talked about bookings potentially being down this quarter, so could you also talk a little bit about the linearity of the bookings?
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, I don't have any view on month-to-month linearity, Tore. So I can't help you on that one.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
A lot of questions have been asked, but I was wondering if you had any visibility from a geographic perspective in general on what's going well and what is going down for you in Q3.
Ron Slaymaker
Sure, Shawn. That's hard to say, ""Sure, Shawn."" Okay. So geographically -- and again, what we're -- what I'm going to convey are basically quarter-to-date and just if we extrapolated that out for the rest of the quarter. So we're seeing growth in the U.S. market. Asia, about flat with last quarter. And then declines in Europe and in Japan as well. So again, growth in U.S., flat Asia and then declines in Europe and Japan. Do you have a follow-on, Shawn?
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
I guess, just quickly on the connectivity side of things, was that also down within your Wireless segment for Q3?
Ron Slaymaker
We do expect connectivity to decline sequentially. That's correct.
Operator
Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from CLSA Securities.
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
Ron, on the OMAP business, the strength that you mentioned, I recall the last couple of quarters, I think you did lose some money in this business. Do you think that strength is enough to drive profitability in this business? And if not, could you give us an idea what the longer-term strategy for this business is?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Srini, so I guess what I would say is that considering that -- overall Wireless revenue we expect to decline sequentially. Keep in mind, the OMAP revenue increase will be more than offset by the decline that we're seeing in baseband. So given that the overall revenue will be down, we would expect that the operating loss that you saw last quarter to increase somewhat this quarter. So in general, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to broaden our base of customers and applications for both our OMAP product lines, as well as our connectivity products, in markets outside of smartphones and tablets. And we've been explaining that strategy to go more horizontal into different adjacent markets for probably 6 months or so now. So we're enthusiastic about what's happening outside of smartphones and tablets, yet on the other hand, I'd have to say the smartphone and tablet market has become less attractive to us, even in the past 12 months. And that really is being driven by -- our view is that the 2 largest players in that market or those markets have really shown a very strong tendency to vertically integrate the key chips in their systems. And so I would just say, obviously, we're not satisfied with the operating loss that we reported last quarter and that we're going to report again this quarter, and we're in the process of working to re-profile the investments that we're making in those areas. So that's probably about as much as I can say at this point. Do you have a follow-on, Srini?
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
Yes, Ron, thank you. On the inventory, I think last quarter, you said the distributors had about 6.5 weeks of inventory. I'm just wondering what you think they'll end up with this quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, distribution. Somebody asked that question earlier. Distribution inventory, we expect to be unchanged with what it was last quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Ron, I was wondering if you could just spend a little time talking about your view around share buybacks. You guys in the past have announced some pretty large repurchase programs. You did the National deal last year, and the balance sheet's not as strong as it was 12, 24 months ago. Can you just share with us how you're thinking about buybacks going forward?
Ron Slaymaker
Sure, Romit. I think if I go back pre-National, we were probably repurchasing $500 million plus, maybe $500 million to $600 million per quarter. I think if -- you're right. When we acquired National, we took on some debt. And we explained at that time that we would continue to repurchase, but we would moderate our repurchases as we also had some debt to service and repay. Since then, we had repaid about $1.5 billion of the debt. And in fact, about, oh, a month, 6 weeks ago, we went back into the debt market and took on basically that amount again, another $1.5 billion. And that really was just based on the very low rates that were available to us in the market today. We described -- and by that, I think our coupon rate on -- we took -- that $1.5 billion was split between 3-year debt, where our coupon rate was 0.45%; and 7-year debt, where I believe, if I remember right, our coupon rate was 1.65%. And so those obviously are very attractive rates. What we described that we would be doing with those proceeds would basically be general corporate purchases, including share repurchases. So the thinking is that we would like to move our repurchases back to the general levels that you saw from TI prior to our acquisition of National Semiconductor. And in fact, if you just look at, in terms of authorization that remains, at the end of the second quarter we still had $5.1 billion of repurchase authorization remaining from our board. So hopefully, that answered your question. Do you have a follow-on, Romit?
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Yes, that's good color. Just on baseband, should we expect that to go to 0 by the end of the fourth quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, that's our expectation, is that by the time we get into 2013, baseband revenue will be essentially 0. Okay, Romit. And I think, as you see from the trends, we're well on that path, so thanks for your questions, Romit.
Operator
And now for our final question from Richard Davis [ph] with Richard W. Davis.
Unknown Analyst
My question, is there a merger in divisions between OMAP chips and the embedded area?
Ron Slaymaker
So, Richard, what we have organizationally is that those are 2 separate product lines. Our Wireless reporting segment and our Embedded Processing reporting segment actually have been combined. I believe we made an announcement on this somewhere back in the May time period, that they've been combined into one organization, really since the priority for both of those product line areas is focused on these horizontal or embedded application markets. So they are all combined, meaning microcontrollers, DSPs, connectivity, the OMAP products, all within one organization that is managed by Greg Delagi. However, for transparency reasons, we have -- we are continuing to report the Wireless business as a separate reporting section. Do you have a quick follow-up, Richard? Okay. Thank you very much for your questions.
And before we end tonight's call, let me say that we have an upcoming investor meeting on September 25 in New York, really focused on drilling down into our strategies for Embedded Processing and Wireless. Most of you should have received an invitation, but if not, please contact us for details. If you haven't registered yet, please do so as soon as possible. Also, let me remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you, and good evening.
Operator
That does conclude today's call, and we appreciate your participation.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for September 11. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate.
Let me start with the market environment. Revenue in the second quarter landed in the middle of our guidance range, with sequential growth of 7%. Orders grew and backlog expanded, although at a slower pace overall than in the first quarter. Also, there was a clear downshift in our order momentum in the month of June.
Even though we believe inventory of TI products is low at our OEM customers and distributors, both are reluctant to place new orders and commit to backlog given the uncertainty in the overall economic environment. This, combined with lead times that are largely below 6 weeks, has resulted in our window of backlog coverage narrowing.
Although backlog for July and August has filled in consistent with a typical third quarter, at this point, our visibility is somewhat reduced for the month of September. This could reflect a range of reasons and potential outcomes. On the one hand, customers could be anticipating their own businesses to slow. On the other hand, customers may simply be waiting until the last minute to place orders, given short lead times. Regardless, as a result of this increased uncertainty, we are being more cautious ourselves in planning for the third quarter and are currently expecting a below-seasonal quarter, with revenue at the middle of our guidance range projected to be about even with the second quarter.  If customer demand builds as the quarter progresses, we are well positioned with short lead times, strong inventory and available manufacturing capacity to support a higher level of shipments.
Let me now walk through the second quarter's results. Revenue of $3.34 billion declined 4% from a year ago and grew 7% sequentially. Analog revenue grew 13% from a year ago and was up 7% sequentially. The growth from a year ago was due to the acquisition of National Semiconductor and, therefore, the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog revenue in the second quarter that wasn't included a year ago. The sequential growth was primarily driven by growth in Power Management.
Embedded Processing revenue declined 15% from a year ago, with both communications infrastructure and catalog products down. Sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 8%, primarily driven by strong growth in communications infrastructure.
Wireless revenue declined 39% from a year ago, primarily due to lower baseband revenue. Sequentially, Wireless revenue declined 8% due to lower OMAP revenue. Baseband revenue ticked up a few million dollars to $90 million in the quarter, although we expect it to step down to about $50 million in the third quarter as we continue to wind down this product line.
Our other segment revenue declined 4% from a year ago and grew 16% sequentially. From a year ago, revenue declined due to the expiration of our transitional supply agreements from previously acquired factories in Japan and China. Sequentially, revenue growth was driven by higher demand for DLP products as well as the seasonal increase in calculators.
In distribution, resales sequential growth of 7% matched the pace of TI's overall revenue growth. Distributors reduced inventory levels by a day and are holding a little less than 6.5 weeks of inventory. Most are waiting until there are clear signs of higher-end demand before they are willing to carry more.
Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.

Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. As I've done in the past couple of quarters, let me start by walking through some of the charges in the quarter that were included in our reported results. Acquisition charges in the second quarter were $104 million. In the prior quarter, total acquisition-related charges were $174 million, consisting of $153 million in acquisition charges and $21 million in cost of revenue.  In addition, we also had restructuring charges of $13 million in the second quarter compared with $10 million in the first quarter.
In total, the EPS impact of these charges was $0.06 in the second quarter compared with $0.10 in the first quarter. Gross profit of $1.65 billion was 49.5% of revenue, and increased 8% sequentially. Recall that in the first quarter, we benefited from about $65 million of insurance proceeds that helped gross profit and gross margin.
Operating expenses of $936 million declined about 4% from the first quarter. At 28% of revenue, operating expenses have moved back into the 20% to 30% range that we target over the course of the cycle.
Our second quarter results included a cumulative adjustment for a revision in our annual tax rate as well as a $10 million discrete tax benefit.
Net income in the first quarter was $446 million or $0.38 per share on a GAAP basis before charges. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the second quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $8 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have reported.
Let me make a few comments on our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $675 million, up $226 million from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $146 million in the quarter, up $43 million from the prior quarter. I should note that year-to-date, capital spending has been about 4% of revenue as we benefit from having pulled ahead fab spending through opportunistic purchases over the past few years.
We used cash to repay an additional $200 million of our outstanding commercial paper in the quarter, bringing the remaining balance of this obligation down to $500 million. We also retired $375 million of maturing debt that we assumed in the acquisition of National Semiconductor. We used $300 million in the quarter to repurchase 9.6 million shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $195 million.
We increased our inventory by $32 million in the quarter, although inventory days declined to 101. Orders of $3.41 billion in the quarter increased $174 million or 5% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.02 in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.21 billion to $3.47 billion in the third quarter. At the middle of this range, revenue would be about even with the second quarter. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.42. We expect the third quarter EPS results will be negatively affected by about $0.07 of acquisition and restructuring charges, assuming the company's marginal tax rate of 35%.
For the year, our estimate for R&D expense has been reduced to $1.9 billion from our previous estimate of $2 billion. Our estimate for capital expenditures is unchanged at $700 million, and our estimate for depreciation is also unchanged at $1 billion. Our estimated effective tax rate has been reduced to 26%, down from our prior estimate of 28%.
In summary, although our financial results for the second quarter were consistent with our expectations, our visibility into the third quarter's demand has been reduced. We remain focused on strengthening our long-term position in Analog and Embedded Processing, while also staying responsive to the twists and turns of near-term demand.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?

[Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
In terms of the utilization rates that you're expecting as you go through the third quarter, I guess that would be the first question. The follow-up, just so then I can go away after that, is, is there ever a cost benefit analysis that would make sense to shutter some of the strategic capacity? In other words, if the expectation is that it's going to stay dormant for an extended period of time, would it make sense to shutter it and then bring it back online when the utilizations picked up?
Ron Slaymaker
Kevin?
Kevin P. March
Jim, let me just start on the utilization in the third quarter. I think implicitly, we don't normally forecast that. But implicitly, with the revenue guidance being flat and inventory being at desired levels, about 101 days right now, I don't expect our utilization level to be going up at this stage, and in fact, it might even decline a little bit as we go into the quarter. As to the second question on the cost benefit of shutting down strategic capacity, you may recall that back in January, we did announce the closure of 2 older factories that from a cost benefit standpoint, the economics of upgrading or trying to improve those factories to compete with some of the newer factories we brought online just didn't pay. So the decision was to go ahead and wind the operations at those factories down. That's one factory in Houston which we expect to close by the middle of next year and another factory in Hiji, Japan, which we expect to close by the end of next year.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
First of all, just looking at the outlook, so flat revenue guidance, EPS up a little bit. Sounded like you said utilization down, which might imply that gross margins may be down a little bit. So is the EPS savings here all OpEx, or is some of it gross margins? Or is it a split between the 2? And could you give us maybe some color on the drivers between -- for gross margins and OpEx into Q3?
Ron Slaymaker
Stacy, let -- just for correction purposes, at the middle of our guidance range, our revenue is flat and our EPS is also flat at $0.38 on a GAAP basis.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Performance sounds like a little higher though, right, $0.01?
Ron Slaymaker
All because -- yes, because we have an extra inside of that flat GAAP EPS. The charges, we'll think of it more rounding up to $0.07 as opposed to rounding down to $0.06 in the quarter. Do you have any other...
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I guess on that first question, then, does that imply sort of gross margin and OpEx kind of flattish to Q2?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Stacy, I think what we're -- when you build your models and make the adjustments for various things we were just talking with Ron about, I think, let's say [ph] that gross margins are probably going to be a little bit better. We'll have a bit of a better mix, we would expect, in 3Q. Recall the seasonality of our calculator business, for example. Third quarter tends to be the strongest quarter. That has fairly good margins. As Ron mentioned, we'll see the baseband drop to probably about $50 million, coming off of $90 million last quarter. And so the remaining revenue that will fill in that gap has slightly higher margins. So between those things, I think you will see the margins probably up a little bit quarter-over-quarter.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, so you mentioned, I guess, limited visibility in September in regard to your customers. What kind of September outlook do you actually have baked in right now to your flat guidance, and where could this go if you would had a normal September, as we seem to have like a normal July and August orders right now?
Kevin P. March
Well, Stacy, normal seasonality for us in the third quarter is to be up on average, seasonality is to be up 6% quarter-over-quarter. So one could say that if, in fact, September fills out in a more normal fashion, we might see growth rates approaching that sort of number. But as Ron mentioned, and as we've been talking about in the press release, given the profile of the backlog that our customers have scheduled on us, we clearly have less demand scheduled in September right now than we would normally have at this stage in the quarter, and that's caused us to be cautious on our guidance, because we're -- it's really not apparent to us why that is the case. Again, is it because customers fear their end demand? Or in fact, did they just got increased confidence that if their demand goes up, we have added with inventory that we could with [ph] short lead times.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sumit Dhanda with International Strategy Investment Group.
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
Just a follow-up on that last point, Kevin or Ron. Could you tell us exactly what your lead times are? In other words, if you did have -- if you did end up seeing that pickup for September, what's sort of the last date by which customers need to place orders so it actually impacts your revenues in the third quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Sumit, I guess one way to think about it is I think we mentioned that the vast majority of our products have lead times less than 6 weeks. So that would say certainly -- and some of that goes all the way down to 0 if we had in-stock inventory. But certainly, that would indicate that by the time we get to our mid-quarter update in September, we'll have certainly better visibility as to what the month of September should be looking like at that point. Do you have a follow-on?
Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, I did. And then just along the same lines, any -- clearly June orders were significantly weaker than you might have expected. Has there been any pickup or stabilization in July? And then, was there any difference in the profile of orders you got, for example, from the distributors versus your OEMs x your wireless OEMs?
Ron Slaymaker
I'll answer the first part, and Kevin, I'll let you handle the second part, if you remember it. In terms of July, the rate of new orders in July, really, Sumit, is consistent with what we saw in the month of June. So we haven't really seen a pickup, but we also haven't seen a further slowdown. So our guidance does comprehend those order trends.
Kevin P. March
And, Sumit, as to -- relates to, say, the distribution channel, for example, what we saw in the second quarter was distributor resales actually increased quarter-over-quarter to about the same rate of TI's total sales. So that was consistent. And their inventory dropped about a day. So they continue to that [ph] hold very lean levels of inventory, which suggest to us that similar to our OEM customers, they're holding only as much inventory as they feel they need to have for a relatively short windows of time, 6.5 weeks, as I mentioned. So it goes back to what Ron was saying earlier, our customers across the board seemed to be carrying very lean inventories, expecting us to be able to meet very short lead times, which we presently have available. And so we should have better insight as to what their final demand will be in the third quarter when we get to the mid-quarter update.
Operator
Next caller comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Just quickly on the Wireless profitability for the June quarter, I would have thought with a better mix of baseband that, that op profit would have been a little bit better. So I wonder if you could just help me understand what's going on there, and importantly, x baseband, what's the breakeven op profit -- revenue you need to see for breakeven op profit kind of in the OMAP and the Connectivity?
Kevin P. March
John, the biggest thing driving the profitability or, quite frankly, the lack of profitability right now in Wireless is the revenue. This is a revenue-dependent business that we talked about for a while. There's a large R&D built going on inside that segment as they develop new products for the end markets they're aiming at, and it really has been one that requires more revenue than it obviously has today to absorb that much R&D. It has clearly got our attention, something we're looking closely into. As it relates to a breakeven number, I would just remind you that back in fourth quarter that revenues at that segment turned in -- was actually above breakeven at that point in time, if you adjust it for baseband. So that's probably your best reference point. I won't try to forecast going forward. As you probably well know from our conversations here in the recent past, we're looking at the opportunities for that business to expand product offerings into the embedded processing space, and that, clearly, will have a different profile of needs as we get all that timing worked out.
Ron Slaymaker
So, Kevin, just to make sure I heard right, you're saying fourth quarter of last year, the non-baseband part of Wireless turned a profit, a small profit, and that would be the closest proxy?
John W. Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes. Ron, just quickly, you talked about baseband being down to $50 million in the September quarter. Just relative to kind of your midpoint of flat revenue, are there any broader revenue buckets that are outperforming or underperforming that you can talk to? Or is everything coming in kind of flattish?
Ron Slaymaker
I would say for the most part flattish, and we don't break the guidance down too much by product area. But as Kevin mentioned, clearly there's a seasonal trend where our calculator business tends to grow third quarter compared to second quarter. So we would expect that, of course, to occur, and be -- and it probably largely offset the decline in baseband. And then outside of that, certainly collectively flattish but generally flattish by product area as well.
Operator
Our next caller is Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just to follow up a little bit on the Wireless group. Are the R&D cuts in the second half, are those all aimed at Wireless? And then is there some sort of time line to where we can tell, let's say, if Wireless isn't profitable by Q1 of next year, then there could be some changes there? And what are the options if Wireless does not become profitable within a 2- to 3-quarter time period of changing the business?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Chris, I don't think anybody said anything about cuts in the second half. I think what we talked about was that we are looking at how to best align the resources to meet the changing market opportunities we see for those products, especially embedded processing space. And that can include also reallocating resources to other areas with better growth opportunities. And I don't have any numbers for you with that specificity as to what a breakeven or how much time that may take and so on. That will all come with time as we decide what the appropriate actions are, if any.
Ron Slaymaker
I think one of the things you're referencing, Chris, was just the fact that we lowered the guidance. And think of that more as anticipated growth that we had planned overall in R&D will not be in the plan or won't be occurring now. And for the most part, if we hold second half quarterly run rates consistent with where we were in the second quarter, then we would probably be rounding down that $1.9 billion guidance that we gave for the full year. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes. Real quick on SVA, it was flat, and the rest of your Analog was up. Was there anything going on there? And do you have any outlook on SVA versus the -- sort of the core TI Analog for the second half or at least Q3?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, there is some stuff going on with respect to SVA but really tied more to fourth quarter and first quarter. You'll recall, in those quarters, we were talking about that we had made some distributor changes. I think in fourth quarter, we had eliminated one of their traditional distributors and then brought on -- brought them onto additional distributors that had previously supported TI in the first quarter, which resulted in some just inventory adjustments in the channel. So think about first quarter for SVA benefited from some channel fill with inventory, and therefore, the comparison is just a little more complex or unfavorable than going into second quarter. So really that's the only difference. If you look from a resale perspective, SVA resales were very consistent with what you saw or what we described for the rest of TI. So again, it's just more noise associated with the changes fourth quarter and first quarter with respect to distributors. And, Kevin, was there an additional part of the question that...
Kevin P. March
No.
Operator
Our next caller comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
The first question is during the mid-quarter update, you talked about wireless infrastructure or comm infrastructure and automotive actually holding up. Could you elaborate a little bit on that comment now, the way you see things now? And is there any market at all that could potentially be up sequentially in the September quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Sure, I can talk about the comms infrastructure. I think automotive, we ended up just from a sequential standpoint with second quarter being down slightly, so that shifted a little bit during the month of June from our prior expectations. But comms infrastructure had very strong sequential growth in the second quarter.  And it's really more of what we've described previously, which is in the North America market, there is a very aggressive build continuing to take place as carriers just try to stay up with consumer demand for data. And so with everybody having smartphones and tablets consuming lots of data, the carrier's under a lot of pressure just to be able to stay up with that demand. Given the strength of our position across almost all of the equipment manufacturers, we're a prime beneficiary of that. So again, it's -- you can say that LTE is starting to come into play a little bit, but really, this is mostly being driven by 3G, really, WCDMA builds here in the North America market. We see that trend on a secular basis continuing going forward, although once we get really towards the end of this year, you'll see more of the carriers' spends start to shift to small cell. Macro doesn't go away, of course, because those base stations are still required. But on the other hand, a bigger part of the carrier spending will likely begin to shift towards small cell, where we have an extremely strong position with our system-on-a-chip, and we look forward to that. But again, that will start here in the North America market. I think it's already begun in some markets like Korea. It will start here in North America late this year, and really, we think we'll ramp nicely from there. So again, a good secular trend for us there ongoing. I think in the automotive space, the only thing I would say is I think that, that market, as you might expect, with economic uncertainty, consumers expressing more concern on where they spend their money, especially on large purchases like automotive, we're starting to see some of that, as well as, I assume, other players will as well. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes. Just for Kevin, the R&D coming down a little bit for the year, is that sort of as a response to the environment? Or have you seen some consolidation programs? Just trying to understand where that's coming from.
Kevin P. March
Yes. Tore, that's a little bit of response to the environment, but it's also on a lowered outlook, some variable compensation, for example, would be less than it otherwise would have been. So I'd say it's a combination of some temporary and kind of permanent adjustments. The permanent, if you will, is that the expected variable compensation will be a little bit less than we've previously planned, and some of the permanent is just realigning some of the programs that we had under way.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Glenn Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Can I just ask a little bit about the order linearity between June and July? Because it sounds like June was very bad but July is back to normal seasonal. And my suspicion is that's probably more about June than July. So in your response, can you also describe what exactly happened in June?
Ron Slaymaker
Let me make sure that you didn't misunderstand what I said before, Glenn. July in terms of new orders coming in really is about the same level that we saw in June, so it hasn't picked up, nor has it slowed down. What I did say is that our backlog coverage, meaning orders that are scheduled to ship in the month of July, looks pretty typical. But in terms of new orders, they fell from May to June, and July is running at about the same, just call it daily run rate that we felt for the month of June overall. So not a change one direction or the other. But again, it's a combination of what we saw in the month of June as well as what we've seen month to date in July that has led us to give the sub-seasonal guidance that we provided. Do you have a follow-on, Glenn?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Well, sort of as part of that, what exactly did you see in June? Was there any sort of pattern in terms of geographies getting weak or end markets getting weak? Or was it just everything across the board?
Ron Slaymaker
I would say pretty broad-based. I mean, there were some markets that shifted maybe a bit more than others. I don't know so much from an order standpoint. Maybe this is a little different twist on your question, but from a revenue standpoint, probably -- let me just kind of walk through the regional results. The North American market, from a sequential growth standpoint, was strongest, followed by Asia, followed by Japan, and then Europe actually was the only region that was down a little bit. At mid-quarter update, I believe I described that at that point, we were expecting some growth out of Europe. So at least from a revenue standpoint, there was a little bit more of a downshift in Europe. Probably no real surprise there. I don't know, Kevin, is there anything that jumps to your mind from a product-line standpoint or from an end-market standpoint? I would describe it as more broad-based, Glenn, as opposed to any particular area of weakness that was pronounced.
Kevin P. March
I would agree. If you look across the whole quarter, you could probably say most of the end markets were up a bit. Auto and TV were down a bit, as Ron mentioned earlier. And the industrial space, it was probably about flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That's kind of the mix we saw in the major markets.
Ron Slaymaker
So, Glenn, I think you're describing that as 1A and 1B on your question list, and you still have number 2 coming. So if you're still there, do you have a question?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes. It's a very, very simple one. Do you happen to know what utilization rates were in the June quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
The answer to that is also very simple. Yes. But we do not disclose specifically what our utilization is. I think Kevin said our utilization overall was up slightly second quarter to -- compared with first quarter. Similarly, the utilization -- the underutilization charges were, therefore, down a little bit. But frankly, as we got into the month of June and saw orders fall off, we changed our loadings, we pulled back on our loadings. And as a result, the underutilization expense did not fall quite as much as we had expected, which you see in the gross margin, which, frankly, was not quite as strong as we had expected in the quarter as well.
Operator
Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Just to keep pushing on this Wireless question a little bit. In the fourth quarter of last year, you had a big high-profile tablet win that helped OMAP business, and I have that business down -- x baseband, I had Wireless down a couple of hundred million from -- in the last couple of quarters. I may be wrong on those numbers.  But do you have the types of OMAP opportunities in the next 2, 3 quarters that can get you back to that level? Or is this more of a kind of waiting for the embedded business to fill in those gaps to get back to that level?
Ron Slaymaker
I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, clearly, in the tablet space, we have other customer wins that you can assume will be ramping into production using new products, new OMAP products from TI before the end of the year. And just where those go in terms of actual success in the marketplace is still to be determined. But clearly, there's opportunity there. And at the same time, as you've heard us say now for several quarters, we're not resting, waiting for the tablet or smartphone space to carry us. We are rapidly pursuing opportunities in the embedded space and more horizontal opportunities outside of smartphones and tablets, and those are showing good traction as well. But there's clearly opportunity for growth in smartphones and tablets as well. Do you have a follow-on, Joe?
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Sure. The Windows 8 on OMAP in the wake of kind of Microsoft Surface coming out with their own Windows 8 tablets on a competitor's ARM chip, what's your customer's interest in continuing to pursue that market? And is that still a big -- or is it a big investment for you guys?
Ron Slaymaker
It is an area that we're pursuing. We have win RT, ported over to our OMAP architecture, and we think that will have opportunities not just in the tablet space, but also in some of the embedded opportunities that we're pursuing as well. So a lot of those embedded opportunities are going to be looking for high-level operating systems to run on our applications processor. And the fact that we have the broadest coverage of any applications processor in terms of high-level operating systems that are ported and running on our chip is differentiation for TI and opens a lot of doors for us. So in terms of the customer enthusiasm, I can't speak for the customers other than to say we are still -- we see a lot of activity with those customers in terms of preparing to launch their own products. So we assume their enthusiasm is unabated, and we'll see where it goes.
Operator
Our next question comes from Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners.
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
Just first question, you talked about Europe softening since you gave the mid-quarter update. I'm curious, you've seen stabilization in that area, and I mean, what's your latest read on that?
Ron Slaymaker
I'm not following your question. We've seen a stabilization in Europe, you're saying?
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
Yes. I'm curious, when you said relative to your mid-quarter update, the one geography that seems to have softened a bit that wasn't necessarily surprising was Europe. I'm just curious with your more typical month of July if things have stabilized there and you guys are looking for more construction type of trends going forward.  Or is that still an area where it's still softening?
Kevin P. March
Patrick, I'd say it's probably too early to tell. Recall that in Europe, it's customary that many of the businesses there take mass vacations during the summer months, especially in August. And so typically, you actually don't see much resumption of meaningful demand in the third quarter from Europe until you get to the end of August. So it's probably too early for us to comment on that just yet.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Patrick?
Patrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
Yes, got you. Yes, I do. And it's really about gross margins. If we look at gross margins going forward here, it sounds like you guys are guiding margins up slightly here in the third quarter. But as we look into the back half into next year, what are some of the structural things we should be thinking about in terms of getting the margins back into the low to mid-50s?
Kevin P. March
I think the most apparent one is revenue growth. As we've been talking about -- we did bring in -- bring on quite a bit of capacity during the last couple of years that we bought for literally pennies on the dollar. And even though it's inexpensive, nonetheless, it does still contribute to our underutilization charges in the quarters. So clearly, the most meaningful way for us to improve gross margins is simply to continue growing our revenues so that we can absorb that underutilization and it will fall through to gross margin. In addition to that, we'll just see a continuation of improvement of mix. As we talked about earlier, baseband will drop to about $50 million, we think, in the third quarter. We still expect that to wind down to essentially 0 as we begin 2013. That will be replaced.  Our revenue that replaces that tends to have higher gross margins. So there'll be a little bit of mix inside there, but I think the biggest driver to point to is revenue growth to absorb the underutilization.
Operator
Our next caller comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
And in the past, Ron, you guys have been able to offer some color on what's going on in the PC market, specifically the disk drive market. There was a lot of movement this quarter. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing right now?
Ron Slaymaker
Sure. I guess what I would say is we saw some growth in disk drives in the second quarter. And that -- there probably was still some residual recovery from the Thailand flooding. But certainly going out of the second quarter, we think that is now fully recovered. Our view overall is that the hard disk drive TAM appears to be softening somewhat, though. And that very well could just be the mix of the types of computing platforms that are shipping. And many of those not using a hard disk drives.  They're using solid-state memory at this point. I think other than that, I think I described that at the mid-quarter that we had seen some mixed signals in the PC space between maybe similar to what we're seeing with analog products, battery management, et cetera and what we are seeing with hard disk drive. And I'd say that, that still held through the end of the quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Doug?
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Yes. So if you could, could you guys give us an update on how the progress of your recent -- or not-so-recent acquisition, the CICLON, Luminary. I know you commented on Silicon Valley Analog already. If you could just go back a little further and just highlight how well those businesses are working within your portfolio.
Kevin P. March
Doug, you may recall, if others were listening, CICLON was supporting the power strategy inside Analog, and I'd say mild indications that has turned out to be quite an effective acquisition and contributing nicely to the growth in power space. Luminary was an acquisition that went into our Embedded Processing side of the house and really gave us a capability in the 32-bit microcontrollers that we previously didn't have a strong footprint in. And we're learning a lot in that space. We simply got a lot more to -- a lot more opportunity, a lot more growth to do there. But clearly, that brought a lot of knowledge to us. It filled in some gaps that we didn't previously have in-house.
Operator
Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I wanted to ask about underutilization charges, especially what is -- is that mostly a cash charge? Is that a noncash charge? And would there necessarily be an uptick in gross margins if you were to just conceptually, say, shutter 5% or 10% or whatever of capacity? So the question, really, is that what is really the cash drag from these underutilization charges?
Kevin P. March
Vivek, the underutilization charges, there's probably a little bit of cash there, but these are mostly noncash. You're talking about assets that are depreciated or not being used. These are mostly noncash. There's going to be some cash, because you're keeping, of course, underloaded clean rooms open, so you're still using utilities and some gases and so on to keep those going, but that's minimal. As it relates to opportunities, when we described in January that we were closing 2 of our older factories, the one in Houston and the one in Hiji, Japan, what we talked about is once those factories were closed, they should save us about $100 million in costs on an annual basis once that's done, so it's by the end of 2013. So those are the kind of numbers that you can think about in this area.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. I'm wondering why your operating margins in the embedded side have lagged. Is it mix? Is it more because of the wireless infrastructure business not doing so well? Because your Analog margins seemed to have recovered somewhat to the mid-20s, but the embedded operating margins are down substantially year-on-year.
Kevin P. March
Yes, what you've got going on -- now year-on-year, you've got revenues down also. If I recall -- let's take a look here real quick. Yes, revenue's down about 15% year-over-year. So you've got underlying just R&D and support costs that are still there, and revenue's down, so that's going to take your margins down. But in the quarter itself, it's probably a bit below what we had expected, and really, that's being driven by some new product startups and some inventory scrappage that occurred in that segment in the second quarter.

Next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
Maybe I'll just pick up on that last question. As we look at embedded profitability going forward, how should we think about the rate of growth in profitability, the rate of growth in revenues [indiscernible] is it -- or are there any projects that you have?
Kevin P. March
Craig, I think you were fading out there. But I think you're asking questions about how to think about the rate of growth in Embedded Processing?
Ron Slaymaker
Embedded Processing, rate of growth of profitability versus revenues going forward.
Kevin P. March
Okay. Similar to Analog, we would expect the Embedded Processing space to grow kind of at historical average, which would be probably in the 8% kind of range over time. In fact, if you take a look inside the Embedded Processing and where we're aimed at, at the 16-bit and 32-bit, those are growing a bit faster than the 8-bit portion of Embedded Processing. So you might see something compound a little bit faster than that over time just from a market standpoint. And of course, our stated objectives are to grow faster than our markets, and we put the resources down to do that. Clearly, with the operating expenses inside that segment being, all things being equal, being fairly stable, any growth in revenue should fall through pretty quickly and improve profitability. So you would expect growth in revenue to occur at a certain pace.  Growth in profitability will occur at a faster pace, just because it's falling through without too much incremental operating expenditure.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Craig?
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
Yes. On the follow-up, we talked a lot about reduction of R&D expense for this year. What about selling, general and administrative?  Should we expect that to be lower than the trajectory you were looking at in the first half?
Kevin P. March
Yes. On the general and administrative costs, we already have actions under way that we talked about when we acquired and closed on the National Semiconductor acquisition. You may recall that we talked about by the end of the first year of acquisitions, that's going to be sometime in the fourth quarter, that we will be removing redundant costs between the 2 companies such that we should have about $100 million of annualized savings after the end of the first year. We're actually making pretty good progress on that front. You may or may not be aware, but back when we closed on the National acquisition, we put some pro forma P&Ls out on the Investor Relations website that you're welcome to go take a look at that helps you see what the 2 companies would have looked like had they historically been combined. And if you go take a look at those, I think you'd find it somewhat insightful to just take a look at 2Q '11 and compare that to our most recent quarter, and you'll see that we're already beginning to see some of the cost synergies of those -- the merger of 2 companies coming together showing up in those results.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Craig and Kevin, do you happen to have a number on how that SG&A compares year-on-year?
Kevin P. March
Sure. It looks like the combined SG&A for the 2 companies on a pro forma basis last year would have been about $478 million, and in 2Q, it was just at $457 million. So you're running about $22 million better on a year-over-year basis.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
May I ask a question? Just one quick clarification from what you just said, Kevin, at the $22 million ahead of where you were before. Is that fair to then say you have $3 million more, and then you're at your $100 million total with the synergies?
Kevin P. March
We would expect to get the rest of it over the next few months, yes, Ross. And really what's coming down there, recall that on our way there, we're having to spend a little leap [ph] to save a little, so to speak. In other words, just integrating the IT systems has caused us to take on incremental cost to get there. But I think it's pretty safe to say that we can see on the radar that we'll deliver that $100 million of annualized savings by the end of the year.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Great. And I guess as my, hopefully, first main question, on the disty inventory side of things, what's your assumption from what the channel does inventory-wise in your third quarter guidance?
Ron Slaymaker
Ross, we may have some assumptions, but we don't publicize those just given distributors will do what they feel they need to do based on their own views of customer demand. But usually, we'll try to provide some insight in the mid-quarter update but not this early as to what we expect those trends to be. So that will be your first question, and you still get another one.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Calculators, you mentioned, is a positive outlier for the third quarter. Could you give us an idea how big was that in the second quarter? Did it go up its typical, whatever it was, $75 million? And how much does it typically rise in the third quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
It was pretty typical, and I'm trying to remember what typical is. Hang on a second, let me see...
Kevin P. March
It did increase about $70 million or so, second versus first. And it customarily goes up pretty close to the amount of decrease that we're going to see in baseband in second to third. But baseband was about $90 million in second, and we expect it to drop to about $50 million. That's not that far off what we would typically see the calculator business go up from second to third.
Ron Slaymaker
$30 million to $40 million type of increase in calculators, typically.
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
I just wanted to take a step back with respect to the third quarter guidance. And typically, if we look in the third quarter and we're seeing a sub-seasonal third quarter, it's typically because -- that there's some inventory to burn in the channel. When you look at the seasonal businesses, I'd imagine that there's still some seasonal build that's going on. It's just more muted than normal. If we're to get towards the low end of your guidance, that would actually imply somewhat of a seasonal decline -- sequential decline. Could you help me to get there? What potentially could drive that? Is there still some inventory burn going on in the channel? Perhaps there's something going on with pricing or something maybe the nonseasonal market segments?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, I'd make a couple of points. I mean, I think inventories are low already. So this is not a case where in second quarter, a lot of inventory was built and now there's potential need to replenish. That's not the situation that we see. We think what happened in second quarter, the growth that came about was not inventory replenishment but was simply customers, for the most part, no longer reducing inventory. And so therefore, our shipments necessarily needed to start moving back up to the rate at which the customers were producing their own product. So not inventory build, but rather the end of inventory depletion. And you can see, as we've said, distribution channel at 6 -- even at 6.5 weeks of inventory, which it's been for the last couple of -- last few quarters was low already, and yet, they did manage to take it down another day, as we mentioned, in the second quarter. So again, I think our third quarter scenario -- I don't think that the downside case or the lower end of the range case has to do with inventory burning. I think it has more to do with if the macro environment weakens and customers take their own production rates down or down from what they are currently expecting, that could come into play. And of course, the upper end of the range just would reflect that customers that today haven't filled in the September orders, just haven't placed those orders yet because they didn't need to based on where lead times were. And so that would drive the upside case. The ""middle of the range"" case is kind of what we see in our backlog now. We're not making a lot of assumptions that we get additional fill-in during the month of September. So hopefully, that helps. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Yes, sure. I mean, just as a follow-up on that, then, embedded in your guidance, assuming the midpoint of the range, then is it fair to assume sort of customer inventory and distributor inventory would be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter in dollars?
Ron Slaymaker
Boy, it's kind of what I was saying before. I don't know that we -- I guess to some degree that may be the case in that we're not seeing signs of -- in the form of backlog, signs of a ramp during the month of September that you might more typically expect just given the upcoming holidays. So I guess you would say at the middle of the range, there's probably the assumption of flattish inventory. But I don't know that we put a lot of assumptions about customer distributor inventory into that guidance more so than just thinking about overall demand.
Operator
We'll go next to Tristan Gerra with Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Could you talk about OMAP as a percentage of Wireless in the quarter? And what was the magnitude of the sequential decline and whether you expect some rebound in Q3?
Ron Slaymaker
Well , OMAP, I think first half overall is running about 60% of the non-baseband revenue. So in other words, OMAP plus Connectivity, kind of a 40 -- a 60-40 split, with OMAP being 60% of that revenue and 40% being Connectivity. So from there, you can probably get pretty close in terms of what those trends were. But clearly, the decline was driven from OMAP. Connectivity was down, but I would describe it was down a small amount compared to OMAP. Do you have a follow-on, Tristan?
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Sure. Could you give us sort of based on your pricing strategy for SVA in terms of your target of getting back to the core growth that you have in your Analog business?
Ron Slaymaker
You said for SVA?
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
For the Silicon Valley Analog, yes.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So I mean, I think their pricing strategy is going to be consistent with TI's own pricing strategy in the catalog space. So it's like High Performance Analog and some of the -- a good part of the power product line, which is we want to be competitive in terms of pricing, but at the same time, those markets you tend to sell into -- not always, but a lot of relatively low-volume applications where the focus from the customer perspective is much more on the product specification, the performance characteristics of the product as opposed to price. These products in general tend to be relatively low-priced products, meaning less than $1 type of ASP. And so as a percentage of the customer's bill of material, it represents a pretty small amount. So customers for these products tend not to be hypersensitive on price. They're more focused on getting the right type of product. And I think with the strength of the product line and portfolio that SVA has, the product -- the focus is much more on getting the word out, getting the support out to a much broader range of customers.  And making sure, of course, we're competitive on price. We're certainly not going to go out and not become -- try to position the product line so that it's not competitive. And frankly, that was part of the issue in terms of that revenue growth before, was reaching for higher levels of gross margin, sometimes the pricing out of National was not competitive in the marketplace.  And you saw their market share loss as a result. So the strategy shift is just make sure you're competitive but, again, make sure we're winning products based on performance and support considerations as opposed to pricing.
Operator
Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Ron, just looking at your sales guidance this quarter, it seems a lot -- a little bit worse than what some other companies have reported thus far in July. As I look at Intel, they guided up 6%, which is a couple of points worse than what they normally do in Q3. Xilinx, if you look at their core business, being down a couple of percent, that's also maybe 1 or 2 points worse than what they normally do in Q3. Your third quarter flat. I think it's about 6 to 7 points below what you normally do. So I'm just kind of curious, what is it about this environment that's hurting you guys a little bit more?
Ron Slaymaker
Romit, I might get -- first of all, Intel probably has just a different type of seasonal pattern. They certainly are much more narrower in terms of their end market exposure. So I'm not sure that we can do much of a direct comparison there. And then I think similarly, Xilinx, if we were just looking at our comms infrastructure trends, they might be different than what we see for overall. And clearly, they're going to have much stronger part of their mix tied to comms infrastructure. So I think of all the companies that -- at least ones that you've named, our exposure is probably much broader than any of them. And the second point is we really are operating in a more uncertain environment. And as we've said, this is a question not of the backlog that's painting a very clear story, and it's a negative story. This is more a question of we don't have all the backlog visibility that we would normally have. And so in that type of environment -- and I think a lot from what I've seen with other companies, that is not unique to TI. And I suspect there's probably just different means by which different management teams will choose to extrapolate what they see going forward. And so I don't -- we've given you what we've given you. We've -- explained the basis for it and what we've done, and I guess I just need to let you sort it out in terms of how that compares to our other semiconductor peers. Okay, do you have a follow-on, Romit?
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Yes. Does the fact that Q3 being 6 to 7 points below seasonal, does that have any bearing on how you guys think about the December and the March quarters?
Kevin P. March
No, too early for that at this time, Romit. I might also add just to remind you that there's still -- one of the things -- even if we did have a seasonal growth, we still have a unwind of baseband going on. So that's the $40 million sequential headwind, 2 to 3Q. So if you adjust for that, it might not be down quite as sharply as you say, although it is still down versus what our seasonal number might suggest. The seasonal number of 6% actually is x baseband and refitted for the inclusion of National.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Romit, let me also just say, as we said before, if this market wants to lift on us versus the guidance we've provided for Q3 or, frankly, even going into Q4, we have inventory position, we have manufacturing capacity. I think you'll find our ability to flex up and support higher level of demand should it arise, that flexibility is pretty high. So we really don't need to at least overly stress about what the outlook into Q4 will look like. We'll work it as it comes towards us.
Operator
Our final question will comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
You've talked about in the past about how with Silicon Valley Analog, you've got a bigger sales team and more field presence. Are you seeing any effect of this on design wins for the Silicon Valley Analog products? And if so, do you expect the growth of the SVA division to actually accelerate past your other Analog divisions at some point in the future?
Ron Slaymaker
I think that's a reasonable expectation, David. As you are implying in your question, right now it's more measured in customer interest and in design wins, and those, then, will be precursors to actual revenue growth that will occur later. But we've long said our assumptions coming into this acquisition was that the share losses that National had experienced pre-acquisition likely would continue into the first year of the acquisition, and then we would hope to have the revenue stabilized and running consistent with the market. And then for the next year and then in year 3, basically have it trending faster than the market, consistent with our own Analog growth. So that would imply over the next couple of years, you could see a faster acceleration in SVA growth compared to TI's own revenue, just as it's coming kind of from a hole to moving consistent with our own revenue growth. And I'll also say, those assumptions that I just talked about were what we built into our financial returns and financial assessment on the acquisition. Our internal goals, of course, are much more aggressive than that, and we're confident at this point that just based on traction with customers, the interest with customers, the design-in rates that we're going to be able to do better than that. But we'll report it as it comes. Do you have a follow-on, David?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes. Your EPS guidance, does that assume any improvement in gross margin in the September quarter? And if so, is this mix-related? Or is there some other factor that helps margin?
Kevin P. March
David, we mentioned early on in the call that there's some improvement inside there, given that, really, the EPS is about flat quarter-over-quarter. Revenue is about flat quarter-over-quarter at the midpoint. So there's a little bit of improvement in there. And we could see a wind-down in the baseband, as lower margin being replaced by the calculator business at higher margin.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Second Quarter 2012 Mid-quarter Update. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the second quarter of 2012. In a moment, I'll provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company. In general, I will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segments or end markets and I will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information.
As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings from our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $3.28 billion and $3.42 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.32 and $0.36 on a GAAP basis. Our estimates for acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges are unchanged and are expected to total to about $0.06 per share, assuming TI's marginal tax rate of 35% is applied to these charges.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?

[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Ron, in the last few weeks, we have seen a number of macro indicators starting to get softer, but you are maintaining the midpoint of your outlook. I'm curious, have you noticed any changes versus your prior expectations whether it be by regional or product basis or end market perspective? Any color you could provide would be very helpful.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Vivek. Thank you for your question. And I guess what I would say is that, as you might imagine, just given what we did in terms of maintaining or just narrowing our guidance around the prior middle of the range, our business is generally tracking well and consistent with our initial expectations. We do expect solid sequential growth in our Analog, in our Embedded Processing as well as our other segments, while we expect that Wireless will decline. From an end market standpoint, the industrial market, that we began to see some early indicators of recovery in the first quarter, continues to recover in the second quarter. Although, I would describe that visibility there continues to remain low. Probably in terms of notable strength, Communications Infrastructure, we expect, will be up strongly this quarter but, even so, not back to the levels that we saw in third quarter of '11. Now probably another major market worthy of mention would be Computing where I would describe that sales in the computing applications are somewhat mixed. But then inside of that, our sales of storage products in the hard disk drive customers, we expect to grow again this quarter. And really, this quarter we believe that things have come back into sync in terms of our shipments have -- are really reflecting a fully recovered situation in Thailand from that flooding situation. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
How would you characterize inventory both at your sites and at your distributors?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, that's a good question. And probably a little different than in the 2. So in distribution, we would describe that inventory is low. In fact, I think I would extend that to customers in general. You'll recall that, I think, for the last couple of quarters, we've described that distributor inventory is about 6.5 weeks, and that again is low by our historical standards. And what we've noticed is that both distributors and customers are really reluctant to build inventory, given kind of your first question, which has tight uncertainty in the overall macro environment. In terms of TI's own inventory, as you saw last quarter, we are well positioned with our inventory and we will maintain that position strength in terms of inventory. And I'd also extend that to we're well positioned with available manufacturing capacity really to support whatever demand situation develops. So if demand were to suddenly strengthen, which is often the case in an upturn situation, we're -- we believe we're going to benefit from the strong inventory situation we have. If the recovery builds more slowly, in that case, our inventory is mostly comprised of what I would describe as long-lived catalog products, and our risk there is low. So in short, the upside opportunity really more than justifies the downside risk. Okay, Vivek, thank you for your questions.
Operator
We'll go next to Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Ron, could you talk a little about linearity either by bookings or billings or both?
Ron Slaymaker
Tore, I really don't have kind of the month-by-month or, I guess, the -- I'd probably call it with -- a week-by-week linearity. Most quarters for TI, this -- the last month of the quarter tends to be our strongest. But even so, typically, the last month we'll be still in the upper 30s as a percent of revenue in the quarter, but -- and so this quarter would be no exception. We, with this guidance, don't expect any kind of a heroic act in the month of June, just more of a normal type of build in that final month of the quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes, I do. You mentioned Communications should be up strongly in the quarter. Could you maybe add a little bit more color in there, maybe specifically talking about wireless versus wireline?
Ron Slaymaker
Sure, Tore. Most of our Communications Infrastructure revenue and exposure is to wireless base stations, so it would be specific to that. And then down inside of that, it's really the North American market, and deployments of WCDMA infrastructure is what's driving it. So kind of more of the same of what we've seen over the last couple of years where North -- developed markets in general, and probably North America specifically, as service providers are adding data capacity to try to keep up with demand from consumers really arising from the broad deployment both of smartphones as well as tablets. So we had a little bit of what I'll call a glitch back late last year with some of the operators putting on -- tapping on the brakes, but it seems like we're out of that mode and back into growth again. Okay, Tore, thank you. And we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
We'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I was curious, how much of the low inventory levels at distribution is a function of your move more toward consignment, as well as the canceling of the one distribution contract from Nat Semi?
Ron Slaymaker
Some of it is consignment. If you look at -- certainly if you look at, Stacy, back multiple years of history, you would say that we're probably down a good couple of weeks versus where we would've been, say, 3 years ago because of the consignment programming. And then again, we have about 30% or so of our distribution revenue now being supported by a consignment inventory program. But when I talk about ""6.5 weeks is low by historical standards,"" I'm making the adjustment already to comprehend the consignment program. So certainly down partly because of consignment but even comprehending what you would expect from a consignment program in terms of reduction of the distributor-owned inventory were low by those adjusted standards, as well. Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Yes, I do. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of your thoughts on the departure of Gregg Lowe.
Ron Slaymaker
Well, Gregg obviously is pursuing an opportunity that he believes will be in his best interest. Gregg is a great manager, a great leader. He was well-respected at TI. And we wish him the best. Not -- we don't wish him too much best because obviously we're competing with him at Freescale. But he's a good man and I suspect he'll do well there. Okay, Stacy, thank you for your questions. And we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
We'll go next to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Ron, last quarter, you commented, I think, that your book-to-bill is tracking above 1 so far. Could you just give us comments on how book-to-bill is tracking so far? Have you seen any changes or fluctuations in bookings for next quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
You're right. Book-to-bill was positive last quarter. And Chris, probably what I'd prefer to do instead of talking about book-to-bill, just because it tends to be very noisy with both the numerator and denominator changing, let me, as usual, wait till the end of the quarter to specifically comment on book-to-bill and maybe just describe more what we're seeing in terms of orders. So what I would say on orders is that they're trending well this quarter, as we saw last quarter, and that we expect both orders and backlog to grow sequentially based upon what we've seen during the first couple months of the quarter here. Okay Chris, do you have a follow-on?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes. Can you give us any progress or update on how the SVA is doing versus your overall Analog business?
Ron Slaymaker
SVA, we continue to be encouraged with the progress there, but I'd really probably would rather wait till the end of the quarter to start getting into the various subsets of Analog. But everything that we've seen in terms of the integration of National Semiconductor, the customer response to that integration -- I'm sorry, the customer response to the acquisition and integration inside of that -- inside of our Analog business continues to be very encouraging to us. So green lights there, but in terms of specific revenue trends and relative to the rest of the Analog business, I'll wait till the end of the quarter. Okay, thanks, Chris. And let's move to the next caller.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
You mentioned the Wireless business will be down sequentially. Can you give us a little more color? Is that because of the baseband side? OMAP connectivity? Any color on that would be appreciated.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, sure, Ross. Baseband, we would expect to be about even with what we saw last quarter. You'll recall that, I think, earlier in the year or maybe late last year, we described that we expect that it will be running about $50 million to $100 million per quarter in general this year, so well within that but about even with where we were last quarter. The remainder of the Wireless revenue, we expect, will decline this quarter sequentially. And that's really tied to customers completing their inventory correction that we described last quarter and also as they prepare for new model launches later this year and basically cleaning out inventory in anticipation of those new phone models. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I do. Just back to the distribution side of things, rather than the inventory that you've answered already, what about on the demand side? How are you seeing demand from just used versus your OEM customers?
Ron Slaymaker
Not dissimilar on either front. So we expect that resales from the distribution channel will increase sequentially. It's not exactly the same as what we're expecting overall but within striking distance, anyway. So in general, pretty similar. Okay, Ross, thank you. And we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
We'll go next to CJ Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I guess, curious, as you think about your conversations in the last few weeks, how have things changed, if at all, given what we're seeing in terms of the macro backdrop?
Ron Slaymaker
CJ, I probably don't have a lot more to say specific in terms of the last couple of weeks other than what I said previously, which is obviously part of our growth is just tied to us. We believe that, over the last -- just over to last, what, starting third quarter of last year continuing through first quarter of this year, our customers were going through an inventory correction. And therefore, we were undershipping their demand. What we're seeing in the second quarter is that we've begun the process of moving back toward their end demand level. So the reality is we could have -- I mean, I -- the macro matters and demand matters but it can wobble a little bit and not affect our near-term growth just as we continue to recover from that correction. Obviously, it can impact a slope. It can impact our customer's motivation to replenish inventory, which again we don't believe has happened at all to this stage. We're just coming out of the correction as opposed to any replenishment. But to date, this quarter is tracking generally consistent with what we had expected back in April when we gave our initial guidance. Do you have a follow-on, CJ?
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Yes, real quickly. On the Embedded business, can you share whether that business is tracking in line with the overall guide here in Q2 or above or below? And any color there would be great.
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I would say Embedded is growing. I don't -- in terms of versus the guidance, I'd probably not like to get into all that detail. But keep in mind, in the -- inside of Embedded, a big piece of that is Comms Infrastructure, which I described as doing very well this quarter. Also growing inside of that is the broader-based catalog product line. So Embedded, overall, is doing very well, mostly driven by Comms Infrastructure and again also driven by catalog. Okay, CJ, thank you. And we'll move to the next caller.

We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
You had commented that you don't believe customers are rebuilding any inventory this quarter. Do you think they are going all the way toward ordering back in line with their demand? In other words, do you need demand improvement in the September quarter to drive further revenue growth? Or could you see some incremental catch-up from customers continuing to order back the demand level?
Ron Slaymaker
Boy, that's a tough one. I think, even at our analyst meeting, we described that we believe that the industry overall was lagging, I -- call it historical trend. And the extrapolation of that trend, by about 20% coming out of first quarter. Now I don't know that -- you probably and you might assume that, that trend line is a rough proxy for end demand, but obviously it's not going to be a perfect proxy. So I'll probably hold off on making any extensions on whether we will still be able to benefit just from -- in the movement back toward end demand in third quarter until we finish this quarter and are ready to give guidance for that quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Sure. I'm assuming the answer is no, given your comments about this inventory and capacity, but I just wanted to check to see if lead times have stretched out at all yet, or kind of have remained stable.
Ron Slaymaker
Our lead times are still short, with the strong majority below 8 weeks. And I think, given what we've done in terms of manufacturing capacity and given what we've done in terms of inventory, we will be able to maintain those lead times at those currently attractive levels. Now I think it's also -- what typically happens at -- as we move through an upturn is it doesn't take our lead times extending. All it takes is for anybody in our customer supply chain to start extending lead times for the customers to then move to that next phase of the upturn, which is basically replenishing inventory versus just trying to maintain really low levels of inventory. And again, that's what we have not yet seen, but again, we're not -- the fact that our lead times are short and are expected to remain short by no means will limit our ability to benefit from that next phase of the cycle. In fact, it's the exact opposite: the fact that we will have product availability as customers start to replenish inventory and put pressure on other parts of the supply chain, we would actually hope to be able to pick up share as we move through that process. Okay, Jim, thanks for your questions. We'll move to the next caller.
Operator
And we'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Can you talk about the direction of your fab utilization as you -- as you move through this quarter? And you mentioned being happy with the current level of inventory. Do you think you need to keep that flat? Or how are you thinking about those things?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Utilization this quarter will likely be about the same on average as what we had last quarter. And in terms of our inventory level, I guess, probably the best way to describe it would be from a day standpoint. And on inventory days, we would expect that we're going to land probably flat, maybe even down a little as our revenue increases this quarter. So obviously, we're keeping our inventory well positioned to support future growth. Do you have a follow-on question?
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Sure. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the automotive space? I mean, it's been fairly recent but we've had some weaker data points on end demand in the U.S. Do you think you'll see that? And if you did see it, over what time frame would you see it?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Joe, I really don't have any specific data on automotive. It's been a market segment that we've -- has been driving a lot of growth even over the past few quarters. This quarter, we would expect it to do well, but it's not -- if I look inside at Embedded Processing, Comms Infrastructure and the catalog product areas are really the ones that are driving the growth this quarter. So automotive, maintaining the strength that we've seen over the last few quarters. Not giving any of that back, but again not the driver of Embedded Processing growth this particular quarter. Okay, Joe, I believe that was your follow-up. We'll move to the next caller.
Operator
We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Ron, I apologize if you already addressed this. Geographically, what are you guys seeing in the business?
Ron Slaymaker
We did not address that. And what I would say is, just based on kind of where we've -- what we've done in the first couple of quarters -- or couple months of the quarter, growth has been led by the U.S., followed by Asia and Europe. Japan is the only region that we've seen a sequential decline in the quarter. So again, U.S., followed by Asia and Europe, with a small decline in Japan this quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
The business is a little bit different than it has been in the past few years, so normal pattern for 2Q. What should we be looking at?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, sure. And that is a good question because our business profile has changed with the inclusion of National, our SVA Analog business and also, as Baseband has declined, and obviously it had pretty strong seasonal patterns on its own. So if you adjust out to add in Silicon Valley Analog and take out Baseband, I'll give you, second quarter on average would be up 9%. So I think, if the -- if you look at our guidance and you make the adjustment for the insurance proceeds that were in the revenue line for first quarter, you'll see that this quarter is just above that. Right around 10%, I believe, is the middle of our guidance range. So we're well aligned with the seasonal 5-year average. I'll just go ahead and give you the rest of the year, if you would like, so we can do this once. Third quarter then would be 6% on average. Fourth quarter would decline 8%, and I'll have to put an asterisk on that, that includes fourth quarter '08. If you exclude that quarter, it would be down 4%. And then rolling over to first quarter, the 5-year average is down for -- again highly impacted by first quarter '09. If you take that one quarter out of that 5-year average, first quarter would be flat seasonally to fourth quarter. Okay, do you -- I believe that was your follow-on, Ambrish. And we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Maybe an obvious question, but given that you've hit the midpoint -- that you're reaffirming the midpoint of your guidance, what's the pattern of your sales through the quarter up to now? How much have you expected? And does that mean that you exit this quarter on a business high?
Ron Slaymaker
David, I didn't understand everything you said. Could you repeat your question?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Well, with the National [ph] business through the various months of this quarter, much as you expected? And does that mean that each month has been stronger than the last and you expect June to be the strongest month so you exit the quarter significantly higher than you started the quarter in terms of business progress?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, so a question about linearity. Our expectation is that June will be the strongest month of the quarter, which is pretty much the case every quarter. As -- I'll just reiterate what I said before so there's no confusion: Typically, the final month of the quarter for TI will run in the upper 30s as a percentage of the total quarter's revenue, and so it is not a disproportionately strong quarter. And part of that even just has to do with when we book royalties and such in the final month of the quarter as opposed to in the earlier 2 months. So we expect this June quarter to be pretty much like every other quarter, which is a strong June relative to April and May but not stronger than would-be typical in a second quarter. So we will come out of the quarter with -- off of the strongest month, but that doesn't imply necessarily anything about going into the third quarter. Do you have a follow-on, David?
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Well, I guess related to that, has order momentum grown through the quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't want to talk about momentum per se because that gets into more complex math than I think I may be even capable of doing, but what I will say is orders will be up. And we have orders and backlog that are growing sequentially, as we did last quarter. Okay, David?
Operator
We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
This is Parag for Uche. Ron, just wondering if you could provide any update on your Windows ARM program. Like, there were a lot of demos in Computex. Any update on that front will be very helpful.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, thank you, Parag, and sure. I think, at Computex last week, you've -- many of you may have noted that Toshiba announced their Windows 8 roadmap, including 2 Windows RT devices that are -- that they're working with TI's OMAP to develop. They announced a roadmap for a clamshell PC as well as a tablet. And again, in both cases they're working with TI. Separately, we demoed our -- we had our own demonstration, which showed Windows RT running on an OMAP 4470 at that same show. And I think most that saw it had some pretty good things to say in terms of the performance of that operating system on OMAP. Do you have a follow-on, Parag?
Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Sure. As for the timing and the revenue parts from this -- for this concern, when should we expect any revenue from this program?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, Parag, I don't want to try to get out ahead of our customers in terms of specific -- or announcement of specific products and when they might ramp that. But I think, incrementally, what came out of that show was that, in fact, TI and Toshiba are working together and then also that we're pretty far along in terms of porting that technology over to OMAP. But I don't really have any forecast to provide separate from what Toshiba might say on their product plans.
Okay, and with that, let's wrap up. Before we end the call, let me remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you, and good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments 1Q '12 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through to the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for more complete descriptions.
Before we begin, let me remind you that TI will host an Investor Meeting in New York on May 3. At this meeting, our CEO, Rich Templeton, and Kevin March, will provide an update on TI's strategy, market positions and goals. If you have not already registered, please do so as soon as possible. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 11. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate. 
Let me start with the market environment. The first quarter's results landed close to our expectations and were consistent with our belief that our business cycle bottomed in the first quarter. Analog revenue was about even. We were especially encouraged by the progress we continue to make with the former National Semiconductor product line, now called Silicon Valley Analog, as it gains traction with customers and holds a strong position in the important industrial market. Early signs point to the industrial market strengthening in the near term as opposed to the delayed recovery that we saw in the last cycle. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew in the quarter, led by strength in automotive and the beginning of a recovery in communications infrastructure. In wireless, revenue fell sharply as we had expected. Baseband revenue declined to less than 3% of our first quarter revenue and we expect it to remain at very low levels throughout the remainder of 2012.
Our Other segment was up as a result of about $65 million of insurance proceeds associated with the Japan earthquake that were received in the last few days of the quarter. The proceeds were part of an ongoing settlement process with the insurance companies and were not included in our earlier guidance due to the uncertainty over their timing.
Core products were 78% of our first quarter revenue, up from 71% a year ago and 66% two years ago. As these products continued to make up a higher proportion of our revenue, our business is becoming more diversified across customers and markets. For example, in 2009, we had a single customer that made up more than 20% of TI revenue. In first quarter '12, it takes the combination of our top 6 customers to exceed 20%. We now have more than 90,000 customers and no single customer comprises more than a mid-single-digit percentage of our revenue.
We believe this expanding diversity is strong evidence that our large sales force and broad customer footprint are paving the way, not only for TI share gains, but also for results that will be determined more so by our own execution in the years ahead and not swung by the fortunes of a particular customer or a narrow market segment.
Consistent with our view that the first quarter was the bottom of our business cycle, we believe growth will resume in the second quarter. In fact, at middle of our guidance range, sequential growth would hit 10% when compared with the first quarter's results without the insurance proceeds. Supporting this forecast was order growth in the quarter of 13%, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 and our first quarterly expansion in backlog since the second quarter of 2011.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was 0.84. We saw a broad-based order growth across the geographical regions and many of our end markets. We believe TI is very well-positioned as our markets rebound in the quarters ahead. Our product portfolio is strong and our design position with customers is excellent. Our acquisition of National Semiconductor should contribute revenue and share gains as customers across the world embrace the strength of this portfolio, combined with the attraction of TI's market channels and our customer-oriented business approach.
As you know, we have been anticipating this upturn, and as a result, we have our inventory well-staged and production in our factories ramping. Our manufacturing capacity is strong, and our teams are poised to drive growth and capture share gains as the market strengthens.
So let's walk through the specifics of the first quarter. Revenue of $3.12 billion declined 8% from a year ago and 9% sequentially, mostly due to lower wireless revenue. Analog revenue was up 10% from a year ago and was about even with the fourth quarter. Growth from the year-ago quarter was due to our acquisition of National, and therefore, the inclusion of Silicon Valley Analog revenue. Sequentially, SVA revenue grew, HPA was about even sequentially, as was power. HVAL was lower due to declines in a number of markets, including consumer, which was seasonally slower, and handsets.
Embedded Processing revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 7% sequentially. From a year ago, automotive grew, while communications infrastructure and catalog products declined. Sequentially, we saw strong growth in automotive, as well as double-digit gains in communications infrastructure revenue. Revenue from catalog products was about even sequentially. As a reminder, communications infrastructure was exceptionally weak for us in the fourth quarter, so it is encouraging to see this revenue begin to recover.
In wireless, revenue declined to $373 million in the first quarter or 12% of TI's total revenue, down from 19% a year ago. As we had expected, baseband revenues declined sharply to $87 million. This revenue was down $247 million from a year ago and down $192 million sequentially. Revenue from OMAP applications processors was up strongly from a year ago but declined from the fourth quarter level, when we benefited from several customer product introductions ahead of the holidays. Connectivity revenues declined in both comparisons.
Strategically, our plan for both applications processors and for connectivity products is to significantly broaden our market reach in areas outside of smartphones and tablets. We have the right products for many of these applications and the customer relationships in place to engage. Although it will take time to significantly diversify this revenue mix, we have begun to shift our investments accordingly and are already well-positioned with some key customer programs.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 11% from a year ago and grew 5% sequentially. The decline from year ago was driven by lower DLP revenue, as well as the end of our transitional supply agreement, most notably our agreement with Spansion that expired at the end of 2011. Sequentially, weakness in these same areas was more than offset by the insurance proceeds and higher custom ASIC revenue.
In distribution, resales were about even sequentially. Distribution inventory remained at about 6.5 weeks, about the same level as we ended the fourth quarter.
Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by walking through some of the charges in the quarter. Total acquisition-related charges in the quarter were $174 million. These charges relate to our acquisition of National Semiconductor and include $21 million in cost of revenue, with the remaining $153 million all on the income statement line identified as acquisition charges. The charges included in cost of revenue were associated with the termination of a National Semiconductor distributor contract. After this quarter, the acquisition-related impact to cost of revenue will be minimal and we do not expect to call those expenses out. All remaining charges should be specifically included on the acquisition charges line.
Also in the quarter, we had $10 million of restructuring charges associated with closing 2 factory sites that we announced in January. In total, these charges impacted EPS by $0.10. Gross profit of $1.53 billion was 49% of revenue and declined 1% sequentially. There were a couple of items that impacted gross profit and gross margin in the first quarter. First, the underutilization expense in the quarter was essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter. Although we increased our wafer starts in the first quarter, wafer output declined compared with the fourth quarter as the effect of our lower production starts in the fourth quarter worked its way through our manufacturing operations. The net result is that average utilization levels of our manufacturing operations, and therefore, the associated underutilization expense, were essentially unchanged in the quarter.
Of course, the underutilization expense should start to decline in the second quarter, as the effect of our higher production starts in the first quarter works its way to our manufacturing operations. Also, as I discussed earlier, we incurred $21 million of acquisition-related charges in cost of revenue in the first quarter. This negatively impacted gross margin by about 70 basis points.
Finally, gross profit and margin benefited from the insurance proceeds. Because this insurance was largely for business interruption, it moved all the way through the income statement, starting with revenue. So if you're analyzing the effect these proceeds had on gross margin, be sure to adjust both revenue, as well as gross profit. You should calculate about 100 basis points of gross margin benefit from these proceeds.
On a segment basis, while we don't normally discuss gross margin at this level, it is important to recall that our transition services agreement with Spansion, which was previously reported in our Other segment, ended in the fourth quarter. As a result, the portion of the Aizu factory that was used to support Spansion is now available for analog products and this underutilized cost is now recorded in the analog segment. Operating expenses of $971 million were above, as we had expected, and the increase in the last quarter is mostly the result of seasonal increases associated with the timing of the holidays and employee vacation time in the fourth quarter, as well as annual pay and benefit increases that occurred in February.
Other income and expense was lower in the quarter, as we took charges associated with the discontinued business. Net income in the first quarter was $265 million or $0.22 per share. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to letting unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the first quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $4 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we've reported.
I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $449 million, down $67 million from a year ago and down $521 million from the prior quarter. As a reminder, cash consumption is typically higher in the first quarter as we pay accrued annual profit-sharing and performance bonuses. Capital expenditures were $103 million in the quarter, down $91 million from a year ago and down $49 million from the prior quarter. In fact, this is our lowest quarterly level of capital spending in almost 3 years, as we benefit from having pulled ahead fab spending through opportunistic purchases over the past few years.
We repaid $300 million of our outstanding commercial paper in the quarter, bringing the remaining balance of this obligation down to $700 million. We also used $300 million in the quarter to repurchase 9.1 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $195 million. We increased our inventory by $65 million in the quarter, bringing inventory days to 105 as we prepare for higher shipments in the quarters ahead. Orders of $3.24 billion in the quarter increased $380 million or 13% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.22 billion to $3.48 billion in the second quarter, for growth about 3% to 12% sequentially. If you eliminate the first quarter's insurance proceeds from the comparison, growth is expected to be 5% to 14% or about 10% at the middle of our range. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.38. We expect the second quarter's results will be negatively affected by about $100 million in acquisition charges and about $10 million in restructuring charges. Combined, these items will impact EPS by about $0.06. For 2012, our estimates for R&D, capital expenditures, depreciation and our annual effective tax rates are unchanged from what was provided to you last quarter.
In summary, our markets have bottomed and are in the early stages of recovery. As we talked about this last quarter, we anticipated this and are well-positioned to service our customers' rising demand as they end their inventory correction and ultimately, begin to replenish their inventory from current low levels. We're looking forward to a year of growth.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up. Operator?

2012-04-23,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Can you help us just walk through the gross margin assumptions here? I think if I back out the insurance proceeds, I'm getting a 48% gross margin for Q1. How do I walk that through to the guidance for Q2? Because I think I'm getting 49% there and I'm not sure if I'm doing that right.
Kevin P. March
Yes, Glen, you're probably doing that right in the direction -- directionally, it's correct that you should be seeing gross margins going up. And by the way, you got your 1Q computation correct when you adjust for the insurance. So about 48% without the insurance. And so generally speaking, we expect that to increase as we move into second quarter. As I talked about, starting up the factories a little bit more, higher utilization, benefits should come early in the second quarter. I'm not sure what share count you're using but I'd say you're directionally moving in the right direction.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
And maybe just as a follow-up to that, I think I might have expected to see more. Maybe can you walk through some of the mechanics there? Is there -- shouldn't we be seeing more leverage in the gross margins or is it more -- am I missing something here?
Kevin P. March
Yes, I'd say you're a little bit like. As I said, Glenn, you're directionally moving in the right direction. Again, I don't know how you built up your model but I would see our gross margins being a little bit higher than what you have built in your model so far.
Operator
We'll go to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I guess a couple of things, maybe. If I could start in the other wireless category. Obviously, one of the sort of back-and-forths over the years has been what will happen to connectivity as the baseband business kind of falls off. Obviously, baseband we all knew about, Other was a little weaker this quarter, too. Is there any way to say how much of that was just the market or is the customer exposure being a little bit softer versus any impact from kind of the basebands pulling the connectivity along with it?
Ron Slaymaker
Glen -- or I'm sorry, Jim, I don't know that I would say there's any direct tie to the baseband. I guess I could say there's an indirect tie in that we sell connectivity products to some of the same customers where we sell baseband, to the extent that those customers' business is not particularly strong as you see both on the baseband line, as well as would show up on some of the connectivity demand products -- demand for some of our connectivity products also. But then, we also have, separately, customers that use connectivity products that do not use our baseband products. And in some of those cases, we've also seen declines as well, totally independent in that case of the baseband.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I guess kind of bigger picture, and this is something that had been asked on the mid-quarter update. But historically, you guys have done very well hitting the numbers. The last few quarters, it's been a lot tougher. Obviously, we were in a downturn and sometimes it's tough to get in front of that. But as you look back on a number of quarterly misses in a row, do you think about approaching guidance any differently going forward or you just -- there, do you just kind of look back on it and say it was a tough downturn but it's over and the way we've kind of rolled up the model historically is how we're going to do it going forward or were there any changes made?
Kevin P. March
Jim, I would say that the short answer is we'll continue to do what we have been doing. It was a tough downturn, that was also complicated by the fact that we were, frankly, executing on the largest acquisition that we've tried to take over in the past. And so that's behind us now, we're moving forward. We use the same model and approach that we have to forecast our outlook.
Operator
We'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I wanted to ask a little bit again about the Core Wireless business. So with the baseband now finally rolling off, we're back to negative operating margins in wireless. Can you give us some feeling what level of revenues in Core Wireless you actually think you need for at least to break even and where those margins can maybe go over time? I'm also wondering, from that margin standpoint, does it actually make sense to be in this business at all? Are you going to drive enough upside as you move it into more of the Embedded business to make up for any of the wireless shortfalls or is that not just some sort of a capitulation as you're moving out of smartphones and tablets?
Kevin P. March
Stacy, I'll take part of that and let Ron help out on some of it, too. If you look back as recently as the last quarter and do your math, you'd see that in fact, the Core Wireless actually did make a profit. So its ability to generate a profit is certainly already proven by the historical results as evidenced by the fourth quarter.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
But that was baseband, wasn't it, that was driving most of that?
Kevin P. March
I think even if you extract that, you'd come to the same conclusion that Core Wireless made a profit fourth quarter. As far as the margins are concerned, we've talked about in the past that the margins in that non-baseband portion, certainly not as rich as what you would see over in analog or even in better processing space, but still quite attractive. The real focus in that area at this point is that clearly, we're spending enough to be able to develop the products that we need. What that team is heavily focused on now is driving the revenue growth and taking it beyond just as single source, Ron, mentioned in his opening remarks, where the diversity of our customers is such that we would expect less impact to the company on single markets or single large customers, and wireless following through on a similar strategy, where they are trying to deliver the technology from their non-baseband products into adjacent markets that can give us more diversity, both of markets and customers. And those will include spaces such as automotive and certain other applications that they've gained some interest and traction on here recently. So the focus there is really now on driving the top line. There's certainly enough spending already in place to be able to meet the R&D requirements.
Ron Slaymaker
So Stacy, just to add, so fourth quarter was about $150 million higher revenue in those core areas. So you asked what level of revenue does it take. That's the recent data point as Kevin said, those core products were profitable at the operating margin level last quarter. So we're nipping on profitability, we just need revenue that will be sustained. And certainly, what we're doing in these embedded areas, by no means do we consider that capitulation, but actually a means by which we can further enhance revenue on what should be a -- basically leverage the investment we've already made for smartphones and tablets and be able to go reach into some of these other market segments as well.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I did actually have a follow-up on that point. So how does long does it take to actually ramp meaningful revenues in those other kind of markets? What's the sort of, I guess, design in lifetime? How long does it take to win that design and how long does it take before we can expect to see meaningful revenues coming out of those? And is there any sort of incremental investment that needs to happen if you think your OpEx in these markets is at comfortable levels to drive that?
Ron Slaymaker
Boy, there were a bunch of questions there, Stacy. I think the core question was how long does it take to drive meaningful revenue in these other areas. And I guess what I would say is, it will take a while. This is not something that, in some of these other areas, where the product lives can be very long. The design in aspect of them tends to be a little longer than some of the high-volume verticals is as well. So we don't expect -- this is not a strategy to go address things over the next 1 to 2 quarters. This is something that we build on what we have today. And over time, we will increase the diversity, and therefore, the stability of that revenue mix. I don't think -- Kevin, you can comment, but I think we believe the investment level that we have today will take us into these new spaces. This is not a big incremental investment to be able to go drive these products into new areas. I mean, think about the biggest infrastructure investment is the sales force, which is already in place today. And by the way, that's the biggest competitive advantage we likely have as well. I mean, clearly, we have to have the right products. Once you have the right products, you have to be able to have the right reach into the customer base and that's the sales force that's in place today. But it's not a big incremental R&D spend to go somehow develop new products or different products for these other adjacent markets.
Kevin P. March
I would just add to Ron's comments there, that this isn't something that the wireless team had just started that is going to be adjacent markets. Greg has already talked about, he talked about it recently in Barcelona that his team has been looking at these adjacent markets for some time now and have over 100 customer engagements already. So that's already began to gain traction, but as Ron says, we expect that each of those markets is such, it will take a while to see the revenue build. But from a cost standpoint, I think that Greg will tell you he's investing adequately now to meet that growth.

We'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Kevin, I just want to make sure that I understand. On the embedded -- I'm sorry, on analog side of the business, revenue was essentially flat. Sequential operating profit was down about $80 million. Was that all due to the Spansion? And help me understand, is that now a continuous headwind around utilization or, help me understand that.
Kevin P. March
John, that's -- the Spansion capacity, the capacity that was being used for Spansion, currently is underutilized, now that we've wound that up. And so that is clearly -- that's allocated into the analog segment and clearly is a drag. But in addition, flat revenues in analog, like some of the other businesses also had seasonally higher paying benefit increases that began in February. So you had the GPM drag that I just mentioned as a result of the utilization, but you also have higher OpEx. So as that revenue builds there, I think it will be able to absorb that just fine over the next couple of quarters, John.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
And then Ron, as a follow-on, now that you have National as part of the fold, I wonder if you could just re-center me as far as the percent of your business being done through distribution. What's sell-in versus sell-through? And then on the sell-in front, relative to your helping strategy, what percent of the sell-in kind of acts like sell-through? And do you think what we're seeing here is inventory restocking or real demand?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, so in the current quarter, a little over 45% of our business went through distribution. And as you noted, John, bringing on board National, where 70%, I believe, of their revenue moved to distribution. Very similar to our catalog analog areas, such as HPA and to a large part, the Power, and a lot of the catalog Embedded Processing businesses. So much of that goes through distribution -- I'm sorry, over 45%. Of that 45%, about 1/3 of that revenue is supported by consignment programs. So I mean 1/3 of the distribution revenue is supported by consignment. I should note, at this point, none of the SVA business through distribution is on confinement because we needed to get IP systems in place to be able to support that. However, that is in fact something that we will do and that we're working toward to put in place. And again, for the broader audience, when you have a distribution program on consignment, our revenue recognition approach sell-in tends to look more like sell-out because it moves the revenue recognition closer to where the distributors pull the product from the hub and actually ship it to their customers. And then if you look more broadly, about 40% of TI's total revenue, and this includes distribution as well as our direct OEM customers, are on consignment. So I hope I got all the pieces you'd asked there, John.

We'll go to Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
I just noticed that your inventory days had crossed over 100 in the first quarter and I was wondering if -- just if you could comment on that level, if it was influencing how you're managing this, the factory loadings here in Q2.
Kevin P. March
Romit, I think that that's more -- remember, inventory days are a backward-looking metric and so coming off of a sharp quarter revenue decline and then following that with a pretty sharp expected quarter revenue increase, you've got to state your inventory before you get to that quarter and not after. And so you wind up with, frankly, an anomaly like you're describing, where the days of inventory compute higher than what you'd normally expect to see. But when we look at the mix of inventory, we are extremely comfortable with it and it's lined up quite well with generally the demand that we see. I recall that we talked about our book to bill went positive in the fourth quarter, our orders increased by 13%. That gave us better visibility into actual end demand than we've had in several quarters now, and that gave us the ability to build and stage inventory in anticipation of when that demand needs to be delivered. So I would say that the inventory is positioned quite nicely for what we're trying to do for the second quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
And, Romit, I would also say that loadings in the second quarter, yes, inventory is one variable that plays into that but probably more importantly will be our outlook for third quarter at that point. And the other thing I would say is just even over the weekend, reviewing some other transcripts of conference calls that have taken place, I mean you're already hearing at this very early stage in the upturn, where certain players are finding their own inventory too short or out of mix and having difficulty meeting up with or fully meeting customer demand. We are delighted with our inventory position at this stage in the upturn. So we think it's going to be great. Of course, it will play out as the market grows here over the next few quarters.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
I appreciate the color. So loadings are increasing in the second quarter. If I do the math on your gross margin guidance for Q2, I'm coming up with, on a pro-forma basis, around 49.5%, which would be up about 150 basis points sequentially, excluding the insurance payment. and I guess my question is on an incremental basis, that would suggest around 60% incremental gross margin, which is lower than I would have expected. If loadings are up, are you guys seeing a negative impact from mix or some other items?
Kevin P. March
Romit, we'll give you guidance on the top line and the bottom line and in between, we'll leave it to you to develop your models. I would say, again, you're directionally correct, we do expect it to be moving up over the first quarter. And certainly in the direction and the magnitude of not more than what you've been describing so far.

We'll go next to Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
You can also count me on someone who's hoping we're going to have a growth here on semis heat. So we've got a number of companies last week talk about issues with wafer availability from foundry and there's some talk that lead times might stretch out over the summer. Can you comment on how your availability is for foundry wafers? And then also, your own lead times, are they stretching out? Do you anticipate that, that could happen over the summer?
Kevin P. March
Chris, I'll start with the lead time question. Right now, again, one of the things that we have as a takeaway on the last inventory correction cycle was the fact that we probably entered that growth period with less inventory than what was necessary to meet, that would turn out to be quite as strong pullback or snapback in customer demand. So we're coming into this quarter certainly with more inventory availability than we had a couple of years ago, when the last upturn occurred. So with that in mind, we have most of our lead times are quite normal at 8 weeks or less and we have higher levels of inventory than we did during the last industry cycle upturn. Plus, we have considerably more capacity than we had last time. Those combined, lead us to feel that we are going to be well-positioned to be able to meet customer demand even on pretty strong growth basis. As far as wafer foundry availability is concerned, again, a declining portion of our revenue is actually sourced from foundries, especially as you consider the baseband is winding down quite a bit, because that was largely sourced from foundries. But non-baseband portion of wireless also sources lots of foundries. But clearly, with the volumes that they're at right now, we are not experiencing any availability issues.
Ron Slaymaker
And Chris, the other thing I would just say is and I think we've had discussions with -- about this in the past. I mean, even if you look at recent [indiscernible] boards, et cetera, total industry utilization is actually at a pretty high level. And you've seen a lot of semiconductor companies over the past few years not need to, and therefore, they did not invest in new capacity. So whether it's the foundries or whether it's the IDM's own capacity, our suspicion is that if we get into much of an uplift at all in terms of demand, we very likely, as an industry, will see shortages and lead times accordingly stretch out. So, at the same time, like Kevin said and what I said before, having a very good inventory position coming into this upturn, plus having a lot of open capacity, we think, is going to serve us very well.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
If you could just maybe run down your take on the end markets, which you think are better, which you think are in the worse shape, and then how you see that playing out for both Q2 and the rest of the year?
Kevin P. March
Okay, I can make some comments. I made probably the most substantial comments already just in terms of our view of what was helping. But clearly, automotive is an area of strength. It's one of the few areas where year-on-year, as I noted, we had growth and that probably partly had to do with some of the automotive industries overall. Globally, we're impacted by supply-chain issues early last year from the Japan quake and tsunami. And so there's a very good recovery. Maybe even some pent-up consumer demand on top of a trend for increasing electronics content and semiconductor growth. Wireless infrastructure, our view is the excess inventory that had tended to build in that channel has essentially been eliminated. We're seeing stronger demand now and we expect that we'll continue to grow from here. Again, we ended up better than fourth quarter but well below both the year ago, as well as even the third quarter revenue levels. In that market, you've heard us talk about before, as consumers with their smartphones and tablets, demand more mobile data. There are just some really positive trends that are taking place there in terms of carriers need to deploy more capacity. And even the type of capacity they're deploying, historically it's been macro cells with -- in both mostly, WCDMA but even to some degree, some LTE. Going forward, you will see more and more of that shift to a small cell type of structure, where our percent of that content, just small cell almost by its very definition, is going to require System-on-a-Chip implementation and we have a great position both in terms of the scalability from what we've done with the same equipment manufacturers from the macro cell and then trying to scale down into the small cell but also just even expanding our position from there. So just a really strong trend, secular trend, overall in wireless infrastructure that we think will play to our advantage, literally, in the years ahead. Handsets, less and less of a direct tie there for TI in terms of the size of that business. But absolutely, we think smartphone market 2012 is healthy. Growth probably in the 25% range for smartphones this year compared with last year. Just some good healthy trends there. Industrial, I think from an end-demand standpoint, probably not a lot of change. But again, I think what we're encouraged about is whereas in that upturn in 2009, we had a lot of the verticals that were lifting in the second quarter, but literally, it wasn't until fourth quarter, if I remember right, before we started seeing industrial really start to recover. We're already seeing industrial markets recover. So again, a lot of it may not be end demand driven, it may just be the fact that they are no longer reducing their semiconductor inventory that's creating the lift on TI. But again, it's healthy for us. Consumer, I think I noted that we had seasonal weakness there and that was in several different consumer areas. I think we had to get out of the first quarter and into what would be a seasonally stronger quarters ahead to really know what's going on in that space. And then probably the last one I would comment on is on computing. We noted earlier that HDD was in recovery mode. We see that continuing into second quarter '12, such that whatever bottleneck HDD has played in terms of the supply side of the PC market, we think, will essentially be lifted. And then, at that point, we'll understand better what PC end demand really looks like.

We'll go next to see CJ Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I guess first question, if I look at the midpoint to the south end of your revenue guide relative to end markets and relative to many of your semi peers, you're clearly tracking a little bit better. So curious, your thoughts here, it's more inventory replenishment or Texan-specific in terms of market share gains and/or your leverage to the right markets? Any color there would be great.
Ron Slaymaker
I think you could see a little bit the all of the above, with the exception of, I don't know that, CJ, I would -- I don't believe we are seeing any real substantial inventory replenishment at all. I think what we may be seeing is lack of inventory reduction. And that, in and of itself, will start to create a lift in demand for us. So again, where ever since, I would say, third quarter of last year through probably first quarter of this year, where we had been undershipping our customers, now that they have their inventory position where they need it, they will start ordering again consistent with their own production rates or their end demand, and that will create a pretty significant lift for us based on our views of how far below that end demand we have been shipping. So, of course, that's going to be broader than just Texas Instruments. But I think we've been busy through the course of the last few quarters, and especially with the National product line, very aggressively working design in position, such that when the market began to lift again, we would disproportionately benefit. And then I think you've also heard us talk about that on the capacity side, we think we will be competitively advantaged, as well as when these markets go back into growth mode.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Real quickly, in terms of some of the discussions around 28-nanometer shortages, I'm just curious if you're hearing anything on the demand side, where on the power management or through all of wireless you're seeing, I guess, some concerns around getting other chipsets and what impacts that might have on the timing of your shipments.
Ron Slaymaker
CJ, just from what I've heard anecdotally through the investor world, it seems like there's some of that starting to rear its head, I have not heard that through our businesses or the customers yet as a specific concern that they have. So it could be there and we just haven't heard it. But we have not had it coming back to us through customers and our business groups yet.
Operator
We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I wanted to revisit this issue of gross margins and how we should think about the different moving parts of Q2 implied margins, what are underutilization charges, what is the mix impact? Essentially, what are the -- sort of, the one-off items and what are the more ongoing items. And then how we should think about the walk back towards the mid-50s gross margins model that you had established before?
Kevin P. March
Vivek, I'll mention what I did a few minutes ago to everybody else. But directionally, we would expect our gross margins to be up. I would suggest that maybe when you folks put the models together, maybe they're not quite estimating some lines correctly when they look into the future. One of the things I would point out is that our OpEx will probably be up another 1 or 2 points in the second quarter. And that's just simple math rolling out. In other words, our benefits increase occurred in February of the first quarter. And so the second quarter we'll see a full quarter's effect of that, and that may be where people are having a little trouble on their gross margin analysis. To as far as our overall gross margin model, I would just perhaps remind you that our focus is on revenue growth, and frankly, it's on revenue growth to grow faster than markets and earnings to grow faster than revenues so we can continue to make healthy cash returns to our shareholders as we have been in the form of dividends and buybacks over the last few years. We're not projecting actual margins greater than 55 and 30 and we're also not concluding this from happening as margins are going to be dependent upon product mix and utilization as you pointed out. I think as you heard from Ron, 78% of our revenue now is from our core products and clearly, analog is now more than 1/2 of our revenue, and that's very encouraging from a product mix standpoint. So I think as we watch that mix continue to shift, we're going to like the results, not just on gross margins and operating margin but importantly, on bottom line cash and what we can do with that for shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
On your Core Wireless business outside of baseband, how do we get the confidence that over the long term, this is a real growth driver for the business. Because when we look in the market, and I think all of these questions have been asked before but when we look in the market, we do see, at the high-end, Apple and Samsung really taking a lot of the high-end business and then at the low end, there's just substantially more competition coming online. So how do you get the comfort that this is a business that you should be investing in over the long term? And even if you take it into some of these embedded markets, would these really add value or will they be lower ASP, lower margin-type market?
Ron Slaymaker
Vivek, I guess, this is one where I would just kind of have to -- we will able to give you some progress report as we proceed where we have particular customer successes in moving into some of these adjacent areas that we talked about. One I can just throw out because I'm thinking about it, a release that happened, I want to say, about a month ago, with iRobot, using OMAP for robotic imaging applications. And that's just an example, but in some cases, customers are amenable to having their names discussed. In other cases, they want to -- they'd rather be a little more discreet until they get their products in the market. I think also, we've announced customers in the automotive infotainment space using, again, OMAP. But, Vivek, I would also say this a case where I think our management team has a pretty strong track record of if a business or an operation, the outlook is not what we think it needs to be, you've seen us not be shy about adjusting our strategy accordingly. And so, this is one way, hopefully, we can get some credit just based on a very long solid track record of making those appropriate strategic moves and it will be management driving that change from inside of the company as opposed to, frankly, convincing Wall Street and getting Wall Street to nod or shake its head on where we're headed. So again, give us a little bit of patience here and we'll try to give you some status reports as we're moving along to help you continue to feel good about where we're going with it.

We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Did you say -- when you talked about small cells, is  that part of the way you have -- would that include that in your guidance or your view for wireless infrastructure both in the quarter that just ended and in the coming quarter? And are you able to -- let me understand how your positioning in that market is relative to other companies such as Casio and Broadcom, and they both free-scale [ph] within that market.  I mean, [indiscernible] has described that market as additive as opposed to cannibalizing macro-based patients. It sounds like you think the opposite. So let me just understand how that plays between your current quarter and your guide and your competitive positioning?
Ron Slaymaker
I think it's -- I don't know additive versus cannibalization. I mean, think what you're going to see is that it's kind of the next wave of technology, I might say, in terms of base stations and we will see a significant part of this spend move to small cell, we believe, as the carriers are doing their best to keep up with just the consumers' data capacity needs. And small cell is one of the most cost-effective means that they can do that because basically, they can deploy these cells with minimal installation costs and even considerations like their electricity usage are much more straightforward than continued deployment of macro level base stations. So I think we're going to see both but we think over time, and this is looking forward, Uche, more so than anything that happened in the first quarter, over time, we're going to see it represent a much more significant piece of the dollar content. In terms of position, a lot of people -- I mean, obviously it's an attractive market, everybody wants to claim success. I guess all I would say is we have a very strong position in macro and we expect that our position in small cell will meet or exceed what we have in terms of macro. So just in terms of where there were known programs that were put out for bid, I shouldn't say that way. Of the total available programs, various carriers, et cetera, not all of which are determined at this point, we've already had design positions in more than, what I would call, half of the small cell opportunity. And those are a number of programs, the market share position actually is higher than that because some of these players are more important than others. So again, we're off to a great start. This is a system-on-a-chip technology, it's going to -- you may see the very first generation be somewhat, what I would call, not integrated. But this is about cost power, a lot of things that because of the form factor, will very, very quickly drive full-up system-on-a-chip implementations. And we're going to be very well-positioned there. So I'll just say we've got great design position, our content, these systems, is going to be very high and we think the market outlook there is really good and it's just going to be one where, again, kind of like what we were saying in previous Q&A, the results will show when the results show. We've got great position but to the extent others claim they have a really great position and create confusion there, we may just have to wait until that translates to revenue and profit growth for TI.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Let me ask you, in terms of your view of the restocking rates, and I ask this question because some of the key lead indicators we look at, like the PMI data coming out of China and Europe still are not -- they're improving, but still not at levels that we think is driving significant confidence in your restocking program going on right now. I know you describe the environment as where destocking has stopped but we've seen the orders go up a lot. Do you think the environment, at this point, is enough for us to feel comfortable with basically where these key lead indicators out of Europe and China are still not essentially clear. I mean, the U.S. is strong. That's fantastic, but to what extent do we need all these order markets to show enough for us to feel comfortable that the orders that we're seeing is going to be sustained?
Kevin P. March
Uche, I think you're asking about restocking rate. You were breaking up a bit on your question there, but I'm going to assume that's what it was. So let me take it from there. As Ron mentioned, what we believe we're seeing is not so much the customers are restocking per se, as that they've stopped reducing their inventories. And so even if they just hold their inventories at lower levels, that's going to result in higher orders for us because they've depleted the pipeline in their prior shipments. From an overall standpoint, we do expect to grow in 2012, which means that we're anticipating the economy is going to do okay to support that. And that's a reference to the global economy. There will probably be some stronger pockets than others. One could reasonably expect the Americas were probably stronger than Europe. One could also look at Asia, China in particular, and say that it may -- they may have purportedly slower growth rate than recent, but it's still growing at an extremely fast rate compared to the Western economies. And that rates against a very large economy itself. It's already the second largest economy in the world. So when we put it all together, I'd say right now, we're not seeing or we can't necessarily prove a point to any evidence of customers restocking. What it appears to us is more like at this stage, customers have stopped draining and are now at least holding their inventories and we'll have to make a few weeks or a few months, perhaps, to report to see if we actually see evidence of restocking.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I want to ask a question on the utilization side and forgive me if it's a little convoluted but the utilization rates you talked about, at 50% to 55% roughly, where did that peak? And really what I'm getting at is you guys added a lot of supply, your own acquisitions of supply, plus adding National. What I'm trying to figure out is how much of that utilization dropped from wherever that peak was due to adding the supply versus the revenues coming down? Or said differently, what revenue do you need to get back to, to have the same amount of utilization-driven goodness with your current manufacturing footprint versus where you were prior?
Kevin P. March
Ross, it may take the 2 of us to try to give an answer for you on that, but the 50% to 55% you're referring to is in fact the utilization rate we discussed last quarter. I don't think we gave -- excuse me, fourth quarter. We haven't discussed what this quarter is just yet other than to say that we have increased our starts in the factories and it takes a while for those starts to become outs. And so our average utilization is about even. But the starts-based utilization actually increased in the quarter. It is worth noting, as you pointed out, the incremental capacity we put in place. Clearly, over the last couple of years, between the factories we acquired and the acquisition of National Semiconductor, we have added $7 billion worth of incremental revenue generating capacity. And so all things being equal, by definition, we've got a lower utilization than we would be at the same revenue levels in the past. And that alone, of course, will cause a larger utilization charge as I think is what you were alluding to. But we clearly have room to increase our revenues substantially with that capacity we've brought on board. And I think the simplest way to think about it is, all-in, it's about $7 billion of incremental revenue generating capacity. From there, I'll leave it to you to kind of model where you think that takes us but frankly, I'm pretty optimistic that's going to not only be attractive from letting us grow revenue rapidly as the markets come back but also do so at very attractive margins given the cost of that capacity when we acquired it.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Hopefully a little clearer one, on the SVA side of things, can you talk a little bit about what was driving the sequential growth there relative to your other analog segments given that there's sell in and so DIST [ph] heavy-- I would have thought that they would have acted a little bit more synchronized with your other businesses?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, Ross, the only other thing I would caution against is that was a relatively easy compare against fourth quarter. Because remember in fourth quarter, we had some distribution channel changes where we discontinued one of their major distributors. We added TI distributors. So I would say first quarter, the compare is relatively easy against fourth quarter. So I don't know that I want to draw a lot of real strong conclusions about this market or that market as opposed to just saying at this point, we would say it was an easy compare and put the challenge in front of that team to let's see if they can do it again. And after that, we'll probably challenge them again.

We'll go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
You're forecasting CapEx at $700 million. Still, to get there, you'd have to double the run rate for this quarter. I'm wondering if in the CapEx you reported in Q1, was it what you expected to? And whether or not you got some efficiencies and there's a chance to undershoot that CapEx number?
Kevin P. March
Mark, the CapEx came in not far off from what we're expecting for 1Q. In fact, you'll see us on the spending, actually spend it closer to when we actually bring the equipment in, with the front end of wafer fab capacity required over the last couple of years, a larger portion of our CapEx is aimed at the assembly test sites. And generally speaking, the lead times on that type of equipment is shorter, and so we can order it and install it closer to when we actually have the revenue need for it. So as a result of that, we still are holding to our prior estimate of a $700 million CapEx for the year. I would just remind you, if you take a look at our actual CapEx spend over the last 12 months, it's been a little over 5% of our total revenue and that's translated into a little less than 7% depreciation total revenue over the last 12 months. So clearly, the spend that we did the last few years bringing on the wafer fabs that we did has been at very little cost to us from a fixed standpoint and is allowing us to actually operate at much lower CapEx levels than we had in the past. We've previously indicated that we would be a 5% to 8% of revenue kind of CapEx model given the wafer fabs that we bought over the last couple of years. Over the next foreseeable future, we'd probably run up the lower end of that range, closer to 5% than 8%.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
The factory -- could you just spell out, Kevin, one last time, the Spansion impact to the gross margin? Is that something that, just, it hits first right now in the second quarter? And can you quantify the impact at all?
Kevin P. March
Mark, I won't go so far as to quantify but I will remind you, we reported when we came out of fourth quarter, the Spansion revenues ran about $34 million a quarter. And frankly, we weren't -- I would graciously say we weren't making a whole lot of profit on that. So as a result, once that revenue went away, the capacity was left behind and was converted and now available for analog. So that cost is all going into the analog P&L now. That occurred with the first quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Whereas previously, when it was there supporting Spansion, it was in our Other segment, Mark. Okay, Mark, thanks for your questions and with this, we'll close up. Thank you for joining us.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' First Quarter 2012 Mid-Quarter Update Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the first quarter of 2012. In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company. In general, I will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segment or end market, and I will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information.
As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filing for a more complete description.
We have narrowed and lowered our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings from our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $2.99 billion and $3.11 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.15 and $0.19 on a GAAP basis. The revenue and EPS reductions are due to lower demand for wireless products. Our estimates for acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges are unchanged and are expected to total to about $0.10 per share.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Lisa?

[Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our first question from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
For my first question, you took revenue guidance down about $100 million on Wireless weakness, but baseband in the quarter was only supposed to be about $75 million anyway. So this suggests either that baseband essentially went to 0 or that you saw a significant amount of unexpected weakness in Wireless outside of baseband, namely OMAP and connectivity. Can you give me some feeling for how the weakness within Wireless broke out? And what may be driving the weakness, particularly in the areas outside of baseband?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Sure, Stacy. As I said, there really is only one area that is weaker than we had expected which is Wireless, and that includes both -- the weakness includes both OMAP applications processors and connectivity products. Outside of our Wireless segment, our revenue is tracking consistent with our initial expectations, which is for that revenue to be about flat with what we saw in the fourth quarter. But back to Wireless, as you will recall from our January release, we had strong growth in OMAP in the fourth quarter, and that was really as we benefited from new product introductions across multiple customers. And as you know, whenever there is a new product introduction by a customer, there's also an associated onetime surge of revenue as those customers fill their channels with product. So although we had anticipated lower sequential revenue associated with that non-recurrence of the fourth quarter channel sales, demand for OMAP is lower than what we had originally expected, as our customers are now rationalizing both their expectations for ongoing demand, as well as the associated inventory. So the result is that we now expect our Wireless revenue to be about $100 million lower than what we had expected back in January. We continue to expect our baseband revenue to decline about $200 million sequentially. So this adjustment is not taking place in baseband. That baseband estimate is the same as what we talked about in January. The adjustment really is across OMAP and connectivity. What's your follow-up, Stacy?
Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Got it. Follow-up just on -- around bookings. And last quarter, you had said that you saw bookings strengthening in December and that strength had continued to move into January. Can you give us some feeling what the trajectory has looked like through February and now into March? And does that still give you confidence? Do you think, I guess, the rest of your broader business is still either at or close to a bottoming?
Ron Slaymaker
Sure. So let me just -- directly on your order question. Order trends are good and in fact, we expect both orders and backlog to grow sequentially. And then to the point of how do we feel about, is the business still bottoming in first quarter as we talked about in January, we do believe that first quarter is the bottom. And again, we look at it from a standpoint of the area responsible for this lower guidance is a single market segment, that being Wireless. And outside of Wireless, again, we're seeing results that are consistent with our expectations and results that are typical at the bottom of the downturn. For example, we've seen our revenues stabilize, again outside of Wireless, revenue flat fourth quarter to first quarter. And we've also seen growth in orders returning. Backlog and visibility are improving. Lead times are short, and we continue to believe that inventory at customers and distributors remains low. So we're planning for sequential growth to resume starting in the second quarter.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from David Wong with Wells Fargo.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
The weakness in connectivity, is it broad-based, or is it specific to a small number of customers or devices?
Ron Slaymaker
The latter. In fact, what I would say in connectivity is that it's really the same as you've heard us talk about for the last couple of quarters there, which is that business is somewhat self-correcting. It's much more diversified now than it was, say, 1 year, 1.5 years ago. But we do have a couple of customers that make up significant amount of our connectivity business that have seen their business decline. So from an absolute design win standpoint, we're -- our position is secure, I guess I would say, or stable maybe is the better word. But some of those programs where we were designed into, we've seen declining business levels over the last few quarters. So we're seeing more of that continue. I should also point out the decline in connectivity in first quarter is less than what we're seeing in OMAP. So again, the decline is more weighted toward OMAP than connectivity. Okay. Do you have a follow-on, David?
Operator
We'll now go to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Ron, just a question following up of the OMAP side. Is it specific to just a handful of customers? Is it across-the-board? I guess, is it really just that their products aren't selling through? Any more color you can provide would be helpful.
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I think it's probably on the -- let me not talk about how many customers because I'll let those customers report their own business when they report. So I'll kind of the stay focused more on what we're seeing directly and in combination as opposed to breaking it out customer by customer. But that being said, I think it's probably a combination. It's very typical for coming out of the holiday season that you see inventory adjustments based upon the absolute results during the holiday season compared to those customers' expectations. And it's probably amplified a bit in terms of that adjustment when you have a lot of new products that are being introduced by those customers because they don't have a real clear record or history of what sales will look like. So they build inventory, they hope for the best, and then in the first quarter, they make the adjustment based on actual results. So that's certainly part of it. And then I think part of it also is based upon that small amount of history now, they're making some assessment of what demand for those products will look like on an ongoing basis and how much inventory they need to support that level of demand. So all of that kind of is blending together to result in the adjustment that we're seeing. It's not -- to your question, it's not a specific customer, but let me just kind of leave it at that if I can. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, and really quickly, kind of a bigger picture question. You guys historically have done as good a job as any and better than most at forecasting not only cycles but quarter-to-quarter. When I look back over the last I think 3 quarters now, you guys have lowered the bar in mid-quarter update and it turned out you actually beat it when you report your results. But it seems like the difficulty in forecasting is a little bit higher than it has been before. Is there something that's changed in either the environment or at TI that's made the forecasting a little bit more difficult? Or what do you attribute that sort of volatility to?
Ron Slaymaker
I think it's the market. I mean, we've gone through a downturn over the last few quarters. And when you have the market going through a rapid change, it's more difficult to forecast. There's not a change at this end in terms of the process or anything like that we've gone through for forecasting. But I hope what you described is the outcome again this quarter. But we're calling it to the best that we can at this point. And I'll also point out, if you look at -- just go back to second quarter and what -- or in the fourth quarter and what took place there, I think everybody in the industry was describing strength in the back half of December. So I don't think anybody had that well forecast. And the good news is that that's kind of the way upturns will happen, right? You don't necessarily get a lot of notice they're coming, and they happen and then they can happen pretty robustly. So and then they'll also happen somewhat in fits and starts. So we'll see where we land, but we're giving you our best estimate of where it will be. And we'll move to the next caller, please.
Operator
And we can now go to Sanjay Devgan with Morgan Stanley.
Sanjay Devgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
You guys have talked about the weakness in Wireless but, if we back out the Wireless business, you talked about the rest of the business being largely in line. But can you talk about kind of the puts and takes across the other end markets? Any end markets that are giving you outside strength relative to what you initially anticipated? And any color there would be really appreciated.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Sure, Sanjay. Let me start with some areas that are -- I'll just kind of hit a few that are doing well, and then I'll also maybe touch on the PC market as well, just given its size. So, but in terms of some areas that are noteworthy on the, what I'll call, strengthening side versus say especially what we saw in the fourth quarter. Automotive is one that's doing what I would call exceptionally well. That's probably not news to anybody because the strength in U.S. automotive sales I think has been widely reported. But as those automotive sales increase and the electronics content in these cars continue to go up, we certainly benefit. So if you look at where TI is positioned, we're very well positioned with both our Analog and our Embedded Processing products and products that make cars safer such as rear-view cameras, blind spot detection and also collision avoidance system. But we're also well positioned in the navigational and entertainment system for cars. And both those areas, you're aware, are seeing rapid penetration and semiconductor content increases. Probably another area that deserves mention is Communications Infrastructure. Again, you'll recall from our January call that in fourth quarter, our Comms Infrastructure revenue declined 40% sequentially that quarter, really as a result of reduced capital spending by North American operators. And although that revenue is not back to where it was in the third quarter of last year, we do expect solid sequential growth this quarter in Comms Infrastructure. So clearly, it seems like it declined but it's turned and it's doing better. And then probably a final point that I would mention in terms of areas of strength is our sales of storage products that go into hard disk drive customers will grow this quarter as those customers continue to recover from the floods in Thailand. And I also said I would just mention the PC market. And it kind of ties to what we were saying, what I just said about storage. So with storage up this quarter, obviously that's reflective of the overall PC market. So the other thing I would say though is that encouragingly, we've also seen recent demand increases for some Analog power products that we shipped into manufacturers of PC battery packs. And why that matters is these battery packs had historically been a leading indicator for other products that will ship into PC on a somewhat delayed basis versus the product going in the battery pack. So we find that encouraging as well. Did you have a follow-up, Sanjay?
Operator
And we'll now go to Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Ron, just a clarification. Can you just give us your approximate percentage of revenue from the wireless market? And when you say ""Wireless"" weakness, is that handsets or tablets too?
Ron Slaymaker
When we talk about Wireless, we really are talking the combination of -- especially in the context of OMAP, smartphones as well as tablets. And the percentage of revenue, if you -- let me do it this way. First quarter, I think we've told you everything else is flat and therefore, the difference between fourth quarter and first quarter is Wireless, which should amount to about $350 million. You'll have to check me on that math, but I'm pretty confident in that number. And so we just gave you guidance of what, something like 3.05 at the midpoint, so a little over 10% of our revenue in first quarter will come from Wireless. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes, does this change the TI belief in terms of the slope or the timing of the recovery at all in semi this year?
Ron Slaymaker
Not at all because again, the adjustment we're seeing is very specific to what I'll describe as a pretty narrow segment of the market, much broader businesses that were deemed -- whether it's industrial, whether it's the catalog product that go across such a diverse array of applications, whether it's other vertical segments. As I've said, revenue is bottoming and profiling as we had expected and even more encouraging is what we're seeing on the order front and growing backlog. So there's really no change to our view of the timing or the profile of the recovery. We look at it as we've got an adjustment taking place in a narrow vertical segment of the market being handsets. All right.
Operator
And we'll now go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Financial Group.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Ron, just a follow-up on your comments, is that just to bounce back from the deep sequential decline, or are you saying that there's a sustained pattern that you're seeing there?
Ron Slaymaker
There was a sustained pattern underway, which is before the decline, which was North American -- especially driven by North American consumers consuming incredible amounts of data. And the various service operators are really just scrambling to try to keep up with consumer demand. And for those of you that have gotten e-mails from service providers talking about throttling data and such, I'm sure you understand exactly what that's about. And so as that demand -- consumer demand has not slowed at all, that's just a very sustained trend going on. Now outside of the U.S., we do expect to see China, to see India start adding data capacity as well, although I will also say that has not yet begun. But what we then saw in fourth quarter was some of those U.S. carriers that has been adding capacity slow down the capital spending, and we're seeing that now start to resume again. So there absolutely was a soft spot in fourth quarter just when the carrier stopped spending. It's picking back up, and there's no reason for us to believe that, that overall trend of consumers consuming more data and service providers trying to keep up with them in terms of just adding 3G and then soon to be LTE capacity will continue as well. So absolutely, we believe it's the same. Do you have a follow-on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Yes, I do Ron. At the Mobile World I understood that you had a pretty compelling differentiated view, and this is a longer-term question on how TI is approaching Embedded with OMAP. So my question was how is the mix going to look as we exit this year? Today, it's mostly tablets and handsets. Is that going to matter ending this year, exiting this year or is it more 2 years out from now that we'll see more non- kind of what we call traditional OMAP applications in the mix?
Ron Slaymaker
I think you will see, by the end of this year, we will have a lot of evidence for you in terms of various programs that are using OMAP outside of smartphones and outside of tablets. I think you heard Gregg talked about today we have more than 100 asset customer engagements outside the smartphones, outside of tablets, underway today. Now how fast that revenue ramps relative to smartphones and tablets? I'm going to allow that, that can take some time. But I think you're going to see over the next 12 months a clear evidence of success of our penetration into some of these horizontal segments. And Ambrish, I realized you were at the Mobile World Congress presentation, but just for some of the broader audience, there's a big effort underway to take the OMAP technology that has done so well today in smartphones and tablets and really leverage that into other horizontal markets. That's completely -- and we leverage in multiple ways. We leverage the technology investment that is already in place and then secondly, where in smartphones and tablets, you tend to have a pretty narrow customer base, the horizontal market really leverage the breadth and scale of TI's sales force. With 2,500 sales and field applications people, we can identify a lot of opportunities just as we do in Analog, just as we do in Embedded Processing. And a lot of those customers outside of smartphones, outside of tablets need a lot of the capabilities that are inherent inside of our OMAP technology. And what we especially like about that is, Ambrish, you mentioned it was a differentiated strategy. If you compare what we're doing there and what we're ramping through our traditional application processors competitors, most of those competitors, their history is that they are very narrowly focused on a few customers in a very -- that narrow vertical market of handsets and smartphones. So for them to go pursue kind of the very broad-based horizontal strategy that we're talking about is a huge infrastructure adjustment. So the point being, we have a technology we can leverage. And we have the reach and customer footprint on a global basis in place already to go do it. So it absolutely makes sense for us. We're excited about that opportunity. And we think you're going to see those results very clearly in the years ahead.
Operator
And we'll now go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Ron, so let me ask a question. I guess relative to the $100 million shortfall in the Wireless business, any way to help us kind of gauge what percent is coming from OMAP versus connectivity, or what percent is coming from handsets versus tablets?
Ron Slaymaker
Probably not. I think, and again, other than what I said previously, it's more weighted toward OMAP and connectivity. And it crosses both smartphones and tablets that where, again if you just kind of look at, we've talked about in past quarters kind of the range of new products that were being introduced across both of those spaces. I think kind of the dynamics that I was discussing are common to both of those submarkets. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes. And I guess, Ron, I guess when you think about the timing of the revenue shortfall miss, is there anything you guys can do on the OpEx line? Or as we think of the reduction in profitability on the EPS line, is it all coming out of gross margin this quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
You're not going to see an OpEx adjustment because of a very short-term type of revenue fall. I don't think that would make sense for us to go flash R&D or sales force or anything like that in response to that kind of market dynamic. So I think -- I guess what I would say, back in January, we gave you pretty detailed guidance for a lot of the lines on the income statement. I don't have a full line by line update for you. But let me maybe make a couple comments that will help you out. So I think if you go back to our January guidance, we talked about -- from the revenue of gross profit numbers we gave you, you would have calculated that gross margin would be about 47% of revenue at the middle of our range. So we still expect gross margin to be about 47% at the middle of our new lower range, although certainly on a lower revenue number. Therefore, the absolute gross profit dollars will be somewhat less. Operating expenses I think, you should assume they haven't significantly changed nor have our assumptions on restructuring or acquisition-related charges as I said before. But I should also make the reminder that inside of cost of revenue, we have that $20 million of acquisition-related charges in there. And again, that's unchanged as well. So think about 47% gross margin at the new revenue level. OpEx, about the same as what we had told you previously. And I think you can probably get hopefully all that stuff aligned with what we just gave you in terms of guidance.
Operator
We'll take our last question from Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Ron, I guess, the first question is any patterns you can tell us about in terms of geographic demand?
Ron Slaymaker
Sure. So again, this is just based on quarter-to-date. But what we've seen so far is U.S. and Europe are growing, while Asia and Japan are declining. And again, that's -- let me emphasize. That really has a lot to do with global consumption and more just where products are manufactured like handsets or tablets or whatever.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. And then can I ask maybe a slightly longer-term question. You talked about the potential for a recovery. And yet, we're already hearing that the foundries are starting to get sales up. And I recognize you don't make the kind of foundries -- that not all your business is at the foundries. Is there any concern as you look out about the potential for a capacity tightness or shortage as we progress throughout the course of the year from the foundries?
Ron Slaymaker
I think, Glen, one of the considerations is that our overall dependence on the foundry, even though it's for the advanced logic products, we are doing more and more with the foundry. Our mix of advanced logic versus the technology that's required for embedded processors, specifically microcontrollers and Analog products is as much lower as a percent. So more and more of our production becomes in-house because more and more of our revenue comes from Analog, where we're -- we do all that in-house. So that being said, we don't -- so we don't think TI will have a bottleneck with foundry. One thing I will say though is that we do believe that if we get a -- what I'll characterize as a typical rebound off of the bottom and the kind of growth that you might expect over the next couple of quarters, consistent with at least our own views of how far and how far down we are at this point versus, call it, in production rates or production rates by our customers, we do believe we can get to a point where anything that's a revenue hits new highs. And Semiconductor revenue hits new highs, and we can test the limits of the capacity that's out there. So and again, that's a broader industry statement. Of course, you heard us say in fourth quarter, our utilization level was in the low 50s. And so we, given the capacity investments we've made over the last couple of years, we obviously believe we're going to be well positioned in that kind of environment if capacity constraints start to impact the broader industry. So did you have a follow-on, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Actually, yes, just a quick one. You talked about the handset -- well this is the $100 million that's a shortfall. And I heard you say that customers are readjusting their demand expectations. So is it fair to say you do not expect that revenue to rebound back and we should just model forward from this lower level?
Ron Slaymaker
No. I don't think -- I think it will come back. I don't know how -- it certainly probably in the very near term not going to bounce back fourth quarter levels because at a minimum, they had channels still in it. But it's probably first quarter also has inventory correction in it impacting it. So it should come back but somewhere probably between where we are at first quarter and where we were in fourth quarter, if you look at upcoming quarters. So one thing -- let me just -- nobody asked this question directly but I'm going to address something. We keep recently especially get asked about margins. And especially because in fourth quarter, we had talked about that, if you take our gross margin, and you adjust it for acquisition-related charges and the baseband inventory charge, that gross margin was about 50%. And you'll recall that in the January call, we discussed that the closest recent utilization comparison is -- would've been second quarter when utilization was about 5 percentage points higher than what we had in the fourth quarter. And so in the second quarter '09, gross margin was 4 to 5 points below the gross margin that we saw in fourth quarter. So summarizing that, last quarter, we were operating at a higher gross margin even though utilization was lower. And I bring this up because a lot of times, people are trying to -- I think a couple of years ago, we talked about 55% gross margin, 30% operating margin as goals. And in a lot of different meetings, people asked about are those still valid goals based upon kind of that example we just gave. So let me just kind of comment that I think going forward, it's clear we're operating at a new level on the margin front. But that being said, our focus internally really is to significantly outgrow our markets, not try to -- we're not focused on the margin line. We're mostly focused on the revenue line. And we're confident that if we grow revenue and Analog and Embedded Processing, we're all going to like the margins that would result. But again the knob we're focused on turning up and turning up aggressively is revenue growth, but revenue growth in some margin-rich areas, those being Analog and Embedded Processing. So again just based on kind of that number of questions that we've been getting in meetings outside of this call, I wanted to go through that. So I guess another thing I would say is that most of you I think are probably receiving invitations for our May 3 investor meeting in New York City. If you haven't already responded, please, and I know a lot of you have, but if you haven't, please do so to secure your place. We really hope to see you there. And before we end the call, let me remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you, and good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2011 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available to the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for March 8. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate. 
There are a number of important things taking place in our market and inside of TI. Similar to our October call, we will provide additional detail during today's call to help you understand our results and outlook. So let me start with the market environment. 
As you can see, the fourth quarter revenue of $3.42 billion was significantly stronger than the reduced outlook we had provided during the mid-quarter update. Higher than expected revenue came in all our major product lines. We believe this strength well to our outlook is consistent with the historical bottoming pattern in the industry. The slowdown that began in the third quarter continued in the fourth during which customers and distributors were significantly reducing inventory. 
In December, with low levels of customer inventory and short TI product lead time, we experienced significant strength compared to what our backlog indicated at the start of the month. Our belief based on historical trends is that the semiconductor market bottomed in fourth quarter '11 or else will bottom in first quarter '12. Our important market indicators were consistent with this belief. New orders declined 7% sequentially, book-to-bill was 0.84 and distribution inventory dropped to historically low levels. So despite low levels of backlog and visibility, we are forecasting that our first quarter revenue will decline only about 2% compared with the seasonal average decline of about 4% excluding baseband. 
Second, as we enter 2012, we are beginning the final phase of our baseband business. Baseband revenue was $279 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect it will fall to about $75 million in the first quarter and remain between $50 million and $100 million per quarter during 2012. At that level, it will be only a couple percent of our total revenue. I believe investors will be pleased to see our company results driven by our core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing and not the decline in baseband. 
Third, the fourth quarter results include a full quarter of the National Semiconductor operation now called Silicon Valley Analog. Our confidence in accelerating the revenue growth from the National portfolio continues to grow as we spend more time with customers and see the impact of our larger sales force. Kevin will detail the accounting charges associated with National, both in the fourth quarter and the first, and provide an outlook across the remainder of 2012. 
Finally, we announced today our plans to close 2 older manufacturing sites. Kevin will detail both the charges and planned savings from these changes. Let's now walk through the fourth quarter results. 
Total revenue of $3.42 billion declined 3% from year ago and was down 1% sequentially. The positive contribution from a full quarter of Silicon Valley Analog revenue and growth in wireless revenue, especially from OMAP applications processors, helped offset declines elsewhere. 
Earnings per share were $0.25 on a GAAP basis or $0.48 when total acquisition-related and restructuring charges are excluded. Analog revenue of $1.70 billion grew 12% from a year ago and 9%, sequentially, reflecting the inclusion of a full quarter of SVA revenue. 
Our other 3 Analog businesses, HPA, Power and HVAL declined sequentially with HPA down most. Last quarter, we provided historical data for SVA on our website. If you compare its July through September revenue with the fourth quarter, it would have trended in a downward range similar to the remainder of our Analog businesses. 
Like HPA, SVA has exposure to the industrial market, which has been weaker than the overall market recently. I realized there's also interest in the impact of the Thailand floods. Our area of most direct exposure is our Analog storage product line. This revenue declined over 20% compared with the year ago period and sequentially. Encouragingly, the month of December was our strongest month of the quarter as our customers began to recover. 
Embedded Processing revenue declined 18% in both comparisons. As we indicated in our mid-quarter update, communications infrastructure was especially weak in the quarter with revenue down about 40% sequentially and compared with the year ago quarter. This decline was a result of market weakness especially due to particular service providers in the U.S. that has put a temporary hold on their capital spending. Our position within our customer base remains strong. And by the end of the quarter, we began to see some recovery in their demand. Nonetheless, these products are highly complex and are some of our more profitable products, which also negatively affected our mix in this segment and the company overall. 
Embedded Processing catalog products with their exposure to the industrial market were also weak with double-digit percentage declines in both comparisons. Products for automotive applications grew double digits from a year ago and were about even sequentially. 
In Wireless, revenue declined 6% from a year ago but grew 24% sequentially. Sequentially, all the product lines grew including OMAP applications processors, connectivity products and baseband. 
OMAP made up the strong majority of this growth, as we benefited from new product introductions at multiple customers and their associated channel sales. In our Other segment, revenue declined 20% from a year ago and declined 29% sequentially. Calculated revenue declined seasonally a little more than $100 million compared with the third quarter. 
DLP revenue was also relatively weak following our strong third quarter recovery from supply issues associated with the earthquake earlier in the year. Custom ASIC products declined, reflecting their high exposure to the communications infrastructure market. 
I will note that the fourth quarter was the last quarter that we will receive revenue from Spansion as part of our transitional supply agreement following our purchase of the Aizu fab in Japan in 2010. 
Revenue in the fourth quarter from this agreement was about $30 million. In distribution, resales or sales out of the channel declined 8% sequentially. Growth was about the same whether SVA was included or excluded from both periods. Inventory distributors, which now includes our SVA inventory, declined by about 0.5 weeks in the quarter to 6.5 weeks. 
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by walking through some of the charges in the quarter. Total charges in the quarter were $0.23 including $0.16 of total acquisition-related charges and $0.07 restructuring charges. Let me explain each. 
As you will recall, we said in October that our total acquisition-related charges would be in 2 separate income statement lines in the fourth quarter. We consolidated most of those costs, such as restructuring costs, transaction costs, retention bonuses and amortization of intangibles, on the income statement line that we've identified as acquisition charges. 
In the fourth quarter, we had $153 million of acquisition charges on this line. Also, we discussed last quarter accounting rules required that we write up the inventory that we initially acquired as part of the acquisition to fair value and then recognize this expense as part of cost of revenue as the inventory is sold. 
In the fourth quarter, we had $103 million of acquisition charges, primarily associated with the write up of inventory. Going forward, although we have now depleted the inventory we acquired directly from National, we will have one additional quarter of acquisition charges included in cost of revenue. This is associated with our discontinuance of one of National's distributors. In this case, we acquired the distributors' entire SVA inventory at fair value. Therefore, cost of revenue in the first quarter will include a $20 million acquisition-related charge. After the first quarter, we expect the ongoing acquisition-related expenses and cost of revenue to be immaterial and we will not call these out separately. 
So the total acquisition-related charges in the fourth quarter are the $153 million on the acquisition charge line with the income statement plus the $103 million, including cost of revenue, for a total of $256 million. This negatively impacted EPS in the fourth quarter by $0.16. Also, in the quarter, we have restructuring charges associated with our planned closure of 2 factory sites. 
We announced today that we will close 2 older 6-inch wafer fabs in Hiji, Japan, and Houston, Texas. Both of these sites have made significant contributions and demonstrate the tremendous cash flow potential associated with Analog products where factory lives are literally measured in decades. 
Our Hiji fab is 32 years old and our Houston fab is 45 years old. And we are now at the point where it makes financial sense to transition the remaining products to more advanced factories. Combined, these 2 factories supported about 4% of TI's revenue in 2011 and each employs about 500 people. 
The charge for these closures is estimated at $215 million, of which $112 million was taken in the fourth quarter and the remainder will occur ratably over the next 7 quarters. Annual savings will be about $100 million once the transition is complete. You could find the $112 million charge on the restructuring charges line of the income statement. This same line will carry the remaining charges in future quarters. 
The EPS impact in the fourth quarter of the $112 million charge is $0.07. So in summary, total acquisition-related and restructuring charges in the quarter reduced our reported EPS by $0.23. When you review our segment results, all of these charges are carried in our Other segment. 
Gross profit of $1.55 billion declined 11% sequentially. There were 3 items that negatively impacted gross profit and gross margin in the fourth quarter. First, underutilization was significant in the quarter as we reduced production buildings [ph] to avoid excess inventory. We were utilizing just a little over half of our total factory capacity in the quarter, and the amount expensed with this underutilization was about $110 million, which is about $20 million higher than the third quarter underutilization charge. As demand returns and we increase factory utilization again, this expense will reduce. 
Second, there was the recognition of the $103 million acquisition-related write up of inventories [ph] as described. Third, we took a charge of $44 million for excess baseband inventory. 
Gross margin in the quarter was 45.3%. It's interesting to adjust this amount to exclude the impact of the acquisition-related charge and the baseband inventory charge. In that case, our gross margin increases 430 basis points to almost 50%. The closest recent utilization comparison is 2Q '09 when utilization was in the mid-50s or about 5% of the expense higher than the fourth quarter. 
In the second quarter of 2009, gross margin was 4 to 5 points below the adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter despite the higher utilization level. This improvement in gross margin reflects a combination of improved mix and more efficient and cost effective factory operations. And as our utilization improves from here, so will our gross margin. 
Operating expenses of $918 million increased $135 million compared with the prior quarter. Most of this increase was the result of including a full quarter of Silicon Valley Analog results compared with only a few days in the last quarter. There was also a negative transitional effect associated with the catch-up adjustments that were made to the variable components of our compensation plans in the third quarter that did not recur in the fourth quarter. 
Our annual effective tax rate was lowered from our 25% estimate to 24%. The accumulative adjustment for this change had a net discrete tax benefit of $11 million, lowered our tax rate for the quarter to 15%. Net income in the fourth quarter was $298 million or $0.25 per share. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restriction stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the fourth quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $5 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be as any higher than we have reported. I'll leave most of cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release; however, let me just make a few comments. 
Cash flow from operations was $970 million, down $170 million from last quarter. Capital expenditures were $152 million in the quarter, down from $193 million in the prior quarter. We used $300 million in the quarter to repurchase 10.4 million shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $193 million. We reduced our inventory by $177 million in the quarter. The decline is primarily due to the recognition of the fair value write up of the acquired inventory as well as our action to reduce production loadings. It also includes the baseband inventory charge. Inventory days were 86 or 91 if you exclude the impact of acquisition charges from cost of revenue in this calculation. And 91 days is comparable to the 92 days that we discussed in the third quarter. 
Orders of $2.86 billion in the quarter were down 7% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 0.84 in the quarter. 
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.02 billion to $3.28 billion in the first quarter or down 12% to down 4% sequentially. Keep in mind that we expect baseband revenue to decline from $279 million in the fourth quarter to about $75 million in the first quarter. This means at the middle of our guidance range, we expect the remainder of our revenue to decline about 2%, which is a little better than the seasonal average. 
As Ron said earlier, we expect baseband revenue to remain in a $50 million to $100 million range per quarter for the remainder of 2012. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.24. We expect EPS will be negatively impacted by about $0.09 associated with total acquisition-related charges including about $150 million of acquisition charges and additionally about $20 million of charges included in cost of revenue. Also, restructuring charges associated with the planned factory closures that I previously discussed will be about a $0.01 impact on EPS. 
For 2012, our estimate for R&D is $2 billion. For capital expenditures, it's $700 million; and for depreciation, it's $1 billion. Our estimate for our annual effective tax rate in 2012 is 28%, 4 percentage points higher than in 2011, reflecting our expectation of higher profits in 2012 and the expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011. Our estimates for total acquisition-related charges for the remainder of 2012 are as follows: After about $170 million in the first quarter, we expect the charge in the second quarter to drop to about $110 million and then continue to decline by about $10 million per quarter until we reach $80 million, which is the ongoing amortization of intangibles amount that will continue for 8 to 10 years. We will continue to update you on our expectations as we move forward and we will make these charges visible for you as we report. 
To help you understand our transition from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, let me provide you some visibility this quarter beyond our traditional guidance. First, at the middle of our guidance range, revenue will decline about $270 million in the fourth quarter or 8%. The decline is mostly due to the decline of baseband revenue, although the completion of our Spansion contract is also a contributor. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit should fall about $70 million to $1.48 billion. This includes the acquisition-related charge of $20 million that will be included in cost of revenue. This charge is about $80 million lower than what it was in the fourth quarter. Also, if you are comparing with the fourth quarter, we do not expect to repeat the $44 million charge for excess baseband inventory in the first quarter. 
Cost of revenue will reflect some seasonally higher expenses as employees take less vacation holiday time in the first quarter and as annual pay and benefit increases take hold. Also, the first quarter will include some additional cost as we move from attrition to hiring manufacturing employees in anticipation of stronger demand ahead. We expect operating expenses of about $975 million in the first quarter or about $50 million to $60 million higher than the fourth quarter level. Again, this will reflect seasonally higher expenses due to the less vacation and holiday time in the first quarter as well as annual pay and benefit increases. 
Restructuring costs will decline to about $15 million in the first quarter. This will be about $100 million less than the fourth quarter level. The remaining acquisition charges that are not included in cost of revenue will be about $150 million, about the same as the fourth quarter. 
Other income and interest expense will be about the same in the first quarter as the fourth quarter. And finally, as I previously described, our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2012 is 28%, and that is the rate that you should model for the first quarter as well. Therefore, net income in the first quarter should be about $235 million or about $0.20 per share. 
In summary, the market continues to show promising signs and the bottom has formed and that demand could begin to improve soon. When it does, we intend to be well positioned with capacity and inventory. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
"
2012-01-23,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
The first one is, what's your sense of the slope of the recovery that we're likely to see here. And in asking that question, I'm kind of interested to know, do you think your distributors and OEM partners are going to rebuild inventory? And could you also just clarify, when you said inventories were low as these things [ph] was that on a dollars or days basis?
Kevin P. March
Glen, I'll offer some comment and I'm sure Ron can add some additional color. Right now, as I mentioned or Ron mentioned, we have drained about $850 million of backlog over the last few quarters, so our visibility in the first quarter is quite low. But looking at just the classic signs of what we've seen in many cycles in the past, we do believe we are at  or near the bottom of the cycle. Our distributor inventories are at record lows of about 6.5 weeks, so we would call that very lean. And it certainly looks like our customer inventories are very lean also, especially as evidenced by the unexpected uptick in demand that we had in the second half of December. From the standpoint of how quickly it soaks   back up, that's probably a little bit hard to quantify with any kind of precision given the visibility due to our backlog. But I would point out that from a inventory standpoint, our days of inventory are well staged. If you compare that to the last time we saw a cycle that was probably somewhat similar was back in first half of '09. At that point in time, we came out of first quarter '09 into second quarter '09 with a days of inventory that was down in the mid-70s. This time, we're looking to about 91 days. In addition, as I mentioned, we're beginning to increase our manufacturing staff in anticipation of increased demand. So we will be well positioned for when the demand does come back. Just how steep that slope is a little bit tough to call. Ron, you might add some color.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, the only thing I thought I was going to add, Glen, is you're right. Our view is that distribution inventory is on the low side and probably does need some replenishment. They're not at that point yet where they've begun to replenish, but history would suggest that, in fact, that will occur. And just in general, regarding the slope, we don't really know. But if you just look at history, our industry clearly doesn't have a history of a smooth, low-slope transitions in terms of how it recovers. So we'll be prepared accordingly. Do you have a follow on Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I do. Just regarding fab closures, one part of it is, should I assume that -- how much of the $100 million savings is actually in cost of goods? And then sort of as an adjunct to that, are there any other things like this that you still see you can do to reduce cost?
Kevin P. March
Glen, all the $100 million savings that we were talking about will be in the cost of revenue line, and we'll begin to realize that in its full -- in full order by the time we get to the end of the closure period, which will be over the next 18 months. As far as the other actions, there are no other actions that we would have to talk about right now.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I'm curious, excluding baseband, can you give some color on what end markets are doing better or worse than what you expected at the time of your last update? Where does the rebound look sustainable? And where do you think it's just a temporary sort of inventory filling bounce right now?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, Vivek, that's a tough call. We see the demand, but it's very difficult for us to be able to kind of see through all the customers' channel to understand is that –- does it reflect a movement on in demand or is it just that their inventory correction is beginning to slow. And as you heard us say even back in third quarter, our customers, we believe, were reducing inventory. So even if demand were to remain stable, if the customers just slowed their inventory reduction, that would translate to growth on our end. So again, what we saw late December was very broad-based growth. And again, beyond in terms of is that in demand or just slowing of inventory correction, we don't know. By end market, to be honest with that, we don't have at the mid-quarter update a detailed cut. But I would say based upon the breadth that we saw upside in our product lines, our view is that it really went across almost all end markets as well as almost all regions as well. So I don't have a lot of precision. But again, the feeling is that it was very broad-based across product lines, regions as well as in markets. Do you have a follow on Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. If I look at -- I mean, what I would like to understand is just the trajectory of OpEx in 2012. But more importantly, I think you're guiding R&D up 5% in 2012 if I just compare it to an annualized Q4, that number. And I'm trying to align that with the cost synergy that you were expecting with the NSN integration before. Is the spending higher than what you had expected before? Or were those cost synergies more in SG&A rather than R&D?
Kevin P. March
It was that the R&D, we kind of need to keep in mind that we’ve got a full quarter of -- or one quarter of National in our numbers right now. So to put another way, in 2012, of course, we'll have 4 quarters of National in there. Whereas in 2011, we only had one quarter, so that may be kind of what you're seeing on that front. As far as where OpEx is going, I think the best thing to do is probably just use the fourth quarter guidance that we've given and then go ahead and model from there using the kind of seasonal history that you can pretty clearly see when you take a look at our reported financial results. And as we talked about, we expect OpEx to be up fourth quarter to first quarter in the $50 million to $60 million range. So if you start there and then model that out, that will get you to a pretty good estimate, I think, over 2012 in mind [ph].
Ron Slaymaker
And, Vivek, your observation or your question was in the right direction on the National synergies. We said all along that the $100 million that we achieved in synergy from National will almost wholly be from G&A, and it was our intent to use -- to maintain the entire R&D that was part of the value that we purchased as well as the sales force and achieve synergies on the G&A side.
Operator
We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Ron, I guess my first question is, given that the month of December came in a little bit better than expected from the mid-quarter update, are you now sort of at a run rate where you would expect bookings to grow sequentially in the March quarter and generate a book-to-bill of greater than 1?
Ron Slaymaker
John, let me not extrapolate that far out, but what I will say is the strength that we saw during the latter part of December has carried forward thus far into the quarter. Now what we don't know at this point is what will happen through the Asian holiday period, will things slow back down and part of what we're seeing is pull ahead of that demand or how that will translate. But again, the strength we saw late December has carried forward thus far in the quarter on the booking side. Do you have a follow on, John?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes, my second question is on utilization. Now you guys mentioned about 50% utilization? One, does that include kind of the RFAB capacity that was idle going into this? And I guess secondly, can you help me understand at what revenue level you start to approach kind of that target margin you guys have historically talked about in the past of 55%? And I realize there's a lot of mix that goes into that as well, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about the model now with National included and the baseband business unwinding?
Kevin P. March
Yes, John, on the utilization, it does include all the capacity that we have been discussing over the last couple of years, including the new factories that we brought on and the equipment that we brought  along inside those factories and, in fact, that we are in the low 50% utilization range, the low 50s. To the question of what revenue level gets us to the kind of model GPM, I'm kind of a -- defer that until we can actually produce an actual to represent that to you. Clearly, it's higher than we're at right now. If you just go back and take a look in history, you can see there were a couple times where we approached the 55% kind of gross margin. You can go back into late 2010 and see those kind of numbers that were showing up. So that might be one point of reference for you to just take a look at to anticipate where we'd need to be as we get back to those kind of gross margins.
Ron Slaymaker
John, I can also give you a little more insight into where we actually are with our fabs. So RFAB utilization is about 25% currently. And that includes all the equipment that we purchased, even though some of it may still be shrink-wrapped and in storage. So all the equipment that we purchased for RFAB in that consideration, we have 25% utilization. And again, the equipped capacity that we're talking about today from a revenue standpoint is about $2 billion. So that means we have roughly $500 million of annual revenue in the form of starts that we have loaded at RFAB currently.
Operator
Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I guess first question, curious on how we should think about seasonality for you guys with the no baseband and now adding that semi? How should we think about the typical seasonality into Q2?
Ron Slaymaker
Boy, C.J., it's going to be –- it’s easier to measure seasonality when its history than trying to project in advance, but you're -- just a couple considerations. I mean, as baseband becomes smaller, baseband is probably a product line that was more depressed in first quarter. So, therefore, that would tend to maybe mute out some of the normal seasonal lift that we would have going into second quarter. I don't really -- we haven't done kind of a detailed analysis of national seasonality and what impact that would have, but probably the bigger piece would be what we just talked about, which is less baseband, therefore, less or just depressed seasonality or decline in the first quarter, and that impact then on the second quarter transition as well. Keep in mind, a big part of our second quarter seasonality is a significant growth in calculators in that quarter, which typically will add about 3 points of growth to the company level on top of what semiconductors do. And semiconductors historically, including baseband, historically would have been up about 5. So again, historical all-in seasonality for TI just on a 5-year average would be 8% at the company level with about 3 of those points coming from calculators. Do you have a follow on, C.J.?
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Yes, very helpful. As a follow-up, in terms of gross margins, you told us with a $103 million, but then you didn't exclude the $44 million inventory charge from pro forma. So curious, was there anything else in there that's one-time related? And anything that we should be thinking about one-time in the first half of 2012 as well?
Kevin P. March
Yes, the large things, C.J. were what we talked about there. That's the $103 million of a fair market value -- principally fair market value write up, the $153 million of acquisition-related charges that we put on the acquisition line, $112 million of the restructuring cost that's on the restructuring line and the $44 million we have not excluded. In fact, those are the sort of things that we consider as part of our operations and we need to manage it.
Operator
The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
I just wanted to understand the -- what's the right way to think about National now that you have had a couple of quarters beyond all the time that you spent before that? If do you think x percent growth for Analog, what should be -- just order of magnitude, how much would SVA underperform or not at all in all the sleeping beauties that you've talked about? Are they starting to wake up? And just help us understand the magnitude.
Kevin P. March
Ambrish, I think we've discussed in the past for -- our anticipation in the acquisition of National was that it had been under growing the market for some time now. And as we looked at it, we expected it would probably continue to under grow the market for the first year, by the second year probably approaching the market growth rate and then by the third year exceeding market growth similar to the expectations we had with our other Analog businesses. At this point in time, of course, at the design win cycle and the design-in cycle and then how long it takes for those design-ins to actually turn into production revenue, I don't think that we will suggest that you change your expectation from what I just described. That's not to say that we're not being a lot more aggressive internally to try and go off and do better than that. But I'd say it's too early for us right now to go off and change that expectation.
Ron Slaymaker
And, Ambrish, I would just kind of underscore customer response. We thought there were some considerations that customers would probably be pleased with our acquisition of National. But as we've been out visiting customers and talking to them, their enthusiasm of this acquisition has exceeded our expectations. So again, our aspirations are high. We're going to turn it into a lot of revenue growth. And we'll let you know probably as it happens more so than trying to project it out too far in advance. Do you have a follow on, Ambrish?
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Yes, I do. In the -- just as a follow-up to Vivek's question earlier on, in the comp infra [ph] market, this was one that you called out as being very weak particularly due to the North American CapEx. Is the bounce back here something you're seeing just from inventory replenishment? Or do you think in this market you're seeing some signs of sustainability?
Ron Slaymaker
Boy, Ambrish, I don't -- again, I don't know that we can say. Clearly, that market has not recovered. I mean, it was down 40% for the quarter, so we didn't see recovery in the fourth quarter. I think you heard us say even at the mid-quarter update that part of what we had seen was that certain service providers in the North American market had slowed or put a temporary hold on some of their capital spending. So that's not to say there may not be some inventory correction taking place as well, but it was also service providers putting a crimp on capital spending. And again, we saw -- late in the quarter demand is probably too early for us to say with that, those service providers turning on again or was it just the OEM customers that we serviced directly wanting -- coming out of their inventory correction. We don't know that. I think probably our expectation clearly is, as we get into kind of the mid-part of the year, the North American market overall sees recovery. But again, I don't know how to translate what we saw in the few weeks late in December into an overall statement.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
One quick question on the guidance. So it sounds like things are bottoming here and clearly getting a lot better, but the book-to-bill was pretty low at 0.84. I'm just wondering, why guide for better than seasonal with such a low book-to-bill? Is it just because the last 6 weeks has been so strong, you kind of gone higher turns? Or can you just talk about that a little bit?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Chris, I'll add some comments and Ron can add as well. Again, we're kind of looking back to our classics signals that we have seen in inventory cycles in the past. And that is a couple quarters of negative book-to-bills and declining of orders, which tend to then bottom out and then be followed by just some fairly nice revenue growth on a sequential basis. So from that standpoint, we've seen in a couple quarters now of negative book-to-bill, a couple of quarters declining orders. That's not to say that the fourth quarter was necessarily the bottom or the first quarter is the bottom. But we believe we're darn close to it whichever direction it's in. And from that standpoint and as evidenced by the demand that we saw in December and going to January, that's lead us to the guidance that we've offered.
Ron Slaymaker
And, Chris, I think also, as you go back and look at historical cycles, at least with respect to TI's numbers, book-to-bill really was not a leading indicator. We came out of downturns into very robust growth. I mean, just go look at second quarter '09 as an example where we came in to that quarter with a pretty weak book-to-bill and obviously had some pretty robust growth. So again, we don't lean too heavily on book-to-bill. I mean, it's a consideration, but it's not the only one. And the other thing I would just ask you to keep in mind that we have 40% of our revenue and our largest customers, our highest volume programs, on consignment where book-to-bill almost by definition in a consignment program runs at 1.0. So again, there we rely more on those companies' -- those customers' forecasted build rate as opposed to what you would see, for example, externally in the order trends or in the book-to-bill. Do you have a follow on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes, maybe a longer-term question, so in the past, you guys have talked about the target model. I think it was 55% gross margin and 30% off margin. And I think you guys pretty much hit that and maybe you've even exceeded it a little bit in -- towards the end of 2010. Now that the baseband is down to about 2% of res and now that you're folding in the -- a higher-margin National business, can we assume that your peak gross margins and peak operating margins and even maybe your OpEx should be higher now?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Chris, when we talked about that model, we talked as we average our way through the cycle that's what the investors should expect our business to be able to deliver to them. And in fact, as you pointed out, we exceeded that during certain points of the recent past. And right now, we're operating or about to operate below that given what we’re -- our outlook we’ve given for the first quarter. But all that being said, certainly, where we've got a portfolio that continues to get -- to average itself up with the fact that the lower margin business is becoming a smaller and smaller percent. I think it's probably too early for us to predict whether or not our peaks on the next cycle will exceed the peaks in the last cycle. But certainly, we have put together a manufacturing cost model, and we're building a product portfolio model that should allow us to continue to be very reliable when it comes to maintaining that model. I would also remind you that we continue to be very focused on growth, and that is really on our near-term objective as opposed to trying to predict when and by how much we would break out of the model we talked about.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, I think if you just look at a lot of -- just even peer companies, obviously, Analog, Embedded Processing, the part of the Wireless market that we're now focused up on are all, what I would call, very target rich in terms of profitability. And I think from the investor side, we're all going to be much better served just by TI driving a lot of growth in those areas as opposed to kind of getting micro-focused on margins. Margins will be good if we grow the way we have with the way we aspire to grow.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Ron, can I just quickly ask you about Wireless, especially about connectivity as well as OMAP? Can you talk about how you view the sustainability of the upward [ph] growth we've seen in the OMAP business, which obviously is a reflection of solid design wins you had recently? But any insight as to what your commitment and the engagement with your customers are there? And then also in connectivity, the weakness there, how much of that was due to any specific end customer weakness or how much was socket loss?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Let's get back part of your question because I think it leads into the other one. Connectivity, the decline that we saw in, let's just say, the year overall for 2011, we believe, reflects almost wholly the success or in some cases lack thereof by our customers in that marketplace. And the reality is our 2 largest connectivity customers probably underperformed the smartphone market in 2011. And we love our customers, but our connectivity revenue is going to reflect the success of our customers. So that would be the consideration. Our share in connectivity has done well and I would say has been reasonably consistent. And I think you take that same thing over to OMAP. OMAP, there's nothing that says the customer cannot change processors even applications processors, even application processors where they might have a pretty significant software investment developed. But our goal is to make sure they have no reason to change. And so to the extent that we continue to develop industry-leading products and I mean that from a performance standpoint, from a power consumption standpoint. And as long as we continue to treat that customer with the respect they deserve as a customer, we think that business is sustainable over the course of time. And whether it's applications processors or embedded processors in general or our deep history in DSPs, that business over time had tended to be relatively sustainable and those customer relationships have tended to be strategic and long lasting. And again, if a supplier gives a customer a reason to change, that customer will change. But we've been fortunate on that front and we intend to continue to operate accordingly. So again, connectivity in OMAP, the reason we're enthusiastic about it is, it’s a great growth opportunity from the standpoint of the outlook for smartphones and we believe our position within the customers where we're engaged is a sustainable one. Do you have a follow on, Uche?
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Sure, I do. Separate question for Kevin. Kevin, how should we think about your priorities for use of cash going forward? Obviously, the buyback rates has come down sharply from what it was last year: a, because the stock probably has gone up; and b, all the cash usage you've used in terms of National Semi. So between dividends and buyback, how should we think about your use of cash for this year?
Kevin P. March
Uche, you summarized it pretty good there. We have, in fact, stepped down the amount of dollars we've allocated towards the buyback. And we indicated we will do that as a consequence of the acquisition of National Semi so that we can begin to allocate certain cash balances, for repaying  the debt when it comes due. Our use of cash remains unchanged from a priority standpoint though. That is, first and foremost, we're directing the cash at the activities that we believe can result in growth. And the most obvious areas where you see that is in R&D, in  capital, as in CapEx, and then followed by acquisitions. And most of those acquisitions once again aside from National are usually quite small acquisitions. To the extent that we have cash then beyond our needs after that, then we do allocate it of course to dividends. You saw us increase the dividend fairly significantly here, almost 30% in the fourth quarter versus the prior quarter and we also allocate it to buybacks. So that will be the order of cash use but, first and foremost, is focused on opportunities that we believe push the top line for growth.

We'll take our next question from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.
Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research
A couple here. OMAP did particularly well and it has done well the last several quarters, but how should we think about the upcoming year? I'm sure you track competitors' products, the 8960 from QUALCOMM has been getting a lot of adherence and this is their first big push into the integrated baseband modem, which I'm sure you're feeling a little binge out [ph] at RIM and I doubt at Nokia yet. Do we extrapolate out? I know you're not giving guidance here, but why shouldn't we worry about what had been one of your strongest performers in the Wireless group given the landscape in the baseband side of the business -- or the application processor side of the business over the last quarter or so?
Ron Slaymaker
Ed, and again, whether it's the particular competitor you mentioned or the many other competitors that would like to encroach upon our success in applications processors, first of all, we take that as a real threat, but at the same time, we view the opportunity in terms of players where we don't have share and opportunities even within the customers where we're engaged, but we're not -- we don't have all of those programs. There's a lot more that we're missing than we have. And so will a competitor pick up a TI historical opportunity here and there? Probably. But our view is we're not sitting here satisfied with our current share. We are aggressively moving forward to take our success in OMAP today and extend that share. And we recognize fully that we'll be facing a lot of good competitors in the process.
Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research
[indiscernible] without a -- this is kind of an adjunct to the same question. A lot of LTE's product is coming through the design cycle now for this year. QUALCOMM's got probably the leading LTE solution. ST-Ericsson is still struggling, who you partnered with often in OMAP and Infineon. When you go down the list, there aren't that many LTE solutions and, in fact, Samsung and Motorola worked on their own, I think, paired with maybe one of your products. Are you feeling -- is there a risk that not having a baseband, especially a 4G baseband, could imperil that business? Is it something that you're working with your partners on? Or do you think it's also going to equalize out in the next year or so and that will be a robust merchant market for LTE and not one dominant supplier?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, I don't know. I guess part of that question comes with, if there are limited suppliers of LTE basebands, will they be able to successfully through heavy-handed approaches leverage that into application process or business. And I guess what I would say is I think the customers in the space tend to be pretty powerful and those types of approaches by -- where suppliers try to bundle and leverage and all that kind of stuff tend to be pretty short-term successes with those customers. So I don't think -- we think the momentum clearly is toward integrated applications processors first -- I'm sorry, to discrete applications processors versus integrated and bundled chipset, we put that in the same category. I don't think that's a good long-term success for a supplier in terms of an approach to take. So we'll see, but we don't view that as a significant threat today. Do you have a follow on, Ed? I guess that was your follow on.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I want to go back to sort of a derivation to the good question that John Pitzer asked earlier. On gross margins, I guess is that -- and first of all, it looks like the implied gross margin guidance is down a couple hundred basis points for the first quarter. I just want to make sure I'm not too far off on the ballpark there. And then secondly, is there some sort of ratio algorithm we could think about for gross margins ramping x percent of revenue growth? Again, I know mix is going to drive some of it, but x percent growth is going to drive x percent margin expansion.
Kevin P. March
Jim, I think you're about right on your gross margin modeling. This is down to be the very split like the GPM dollar guidance that we were talking about given the midpoint of our guidance. And so, in fact, it is down, but I would remind you...
Ron Slaymaker
So it would be down only if charges were excluded out of the fourth quarter number, correct?
Kevin P. March
Oh, yes. I would also remind you that the first quarter exceeds this normal paying benefits increases in our manufacturing operation as well as our other support groups and, plus, we've moved from an attrition environment in manufacturing to an increase in staff and environment manufacturing. So those things are going to be adding manufacturing costs from 4Q going into 1Q. To your question as to some algorithm, frankly, we're sitting right now at the utilization level and in the low 50s. Any incremental revenue is going to follow through quite well when you got utilization levels like that. And I think that we'll see our gross margins begin to step back up rather nicely with fairly modest revenue growth. There is a particular algorithm I can offer to you, but I'll just simply say you can pretty much model it through on a delta basis as you have in the past. That is, take your delta revenue assumption quarter-over-quarter and drop that through. I think many people drop that through to 60-odd percent. And that's a pretty good way to get to what you think the gross margins are going to be going forward.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes. And, Jim, I think we also gave you how much utilization impact was there in the fourth quarter as well as where our company utilization was overall. So it will give you a little bit of idea as to how to potentially map that going forward as utilization goes up. Do you have a follow on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, I guess just a simple follow up. The baseband, falling away, is that just simply a function of your competitor finally getting that product ramped up? Is that the driver there? Or is there assumption on underlying customer share loss?
Ron Slaymaker
Maybe a little bit of both, but I think there are some competitors that are in the process of shipping more product into that customer. But there could be -- we'll just have to see how that customer translates their product positions into sales. But I think I would allow, we have competitors that are now in the process of ramping.

We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Just wondering, as a follow up on some of your earlier comments with respect to the 2009 cycle and following the rebound you guys saw in early 2009, that was followed by some supply shortages as you guys weren't prepared for the business to come back as aggressively as it did. It sounds like and I guess first part of my question, correct me if I'm wrong in the assumption that it sounds like it's really trying to put the manufacturing assets in place, at least the variable assets to prevent that from occurring again. And what does that mean kind of going forward as we look through this next cycle? What point do you guys decide to ramp up the manufacturing a little bit more, perhaps put some more inventory in place to avoid what happened during that cycle?
Kevin P. March
Yes. Chris, again, just kind of to look back one of the easy metrics to look at and although it is backwards looking, but it's still somewhat instructive is days of inventory. And we were in the mid-70s back as that cycle began to the spring back, this time, we're sitting at about 90, 92 days. So clearly, we've got more available inventory on hand. Also, if you go back and recall the history from back in that point in time, we, like many others, fairly significantly reduced our total workforce leading into that downturn. And so consequently, when demand did snap back, it took some time to bring work force back on and get them trained and get them productive. In this example that we've just gone through, we have not taken that same action. In fact, what we did is we slowed our factories, our idle factories for a few days where it made sense, but we've maintained -- other than attrition, we've maintained that staff on hand so we have a trained workforce already in place. So as demand does snap back, we will have the benefit of a largely already-trained workforce and just having to add incrementally, and we'll have the benefit of starting out with more inventory because there will be more inventory than we had the last time. So you put those together and we think we're a much better position this time to meet strong snapbacks and still be able to deliver in reasonable lead times with our customers and deliver revenue and profit to our shareholders.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Yes. I guess as a follow on about the OMAP business and you talked about the view of the business going forward with respect to your success in that business. Perhaps, you could talk about what you're feeling is still about the synergies of that business with the Analog business. And I'm sure that you're getting some Analog sockets as a result of having the OMAP business. But I'd also assume that perhaps some of your competitors are more reluctant to put you on reference designs because you're having that business. How do you guys balance that internally?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, all of the above are probably the cases where by being in OMAP we'll pull through Power Management products just because this -- we have the insight, first of all so, therefore, we can have the companion Power Management ICs ready to go when we introduce the new OMAP products. In many cases, the customer just finds it easier to use TI. We also have competitors that will use TI as part of their reference design and might they -- the fact that we're a competitor, is that a consideration. I don't really know when they don't have an Analog capability internally but that could be the case. But when it comes down to it, whether we're in OMAP or not, we don't look so much at potential synergies, I would say, between Analog and OMAP. Rather, we look at just the smartphone opportunity is a great growth opportunity. And it aligns well with the capabilities that we have in connectivity, in OMAP and then also in Analog. But we really don't go so much across, well, do we get the pull through of Analog product because we're in OMAP? Some of that may occur, but we sure don't try to rationalize the OMAP business plan based on synergies with Analog is probably the best way to describe it.

We'll take our next question from Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
First question, just going back to visibility and I know you can't sort of predict the bookings is going to do this quarter, but just given the month of December and January, is it safe to say that book-to-bill is positive for those 2 months?
Ron Slaymaker
Oh, it's like -- Tore, let me not get into breaking the quarter down in terms of book-to-bill because the tough part on book-to-bill is you have multiple variables in the numerator and the denominator that can swing that number around pretty dramatically. And what we've seen in terms of strength thus far in January, boy I sure  don't want to try to extrapolate that out through the end of the quarter, we're optimistic. But again, let me wait until we get further along. Do you have a follow on?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Yes, that's fair. I'll have an easier follow-up to Kevin. Kevin, the $700 million CapEx for the year, should we model that to be sort of the linear?
Kevin P. March
For now, Tore, I would go ahead and recommend that that's probably not a bad way to look at it.
Ron Slaymaker
But by the way, Tore, there's no requirement you give Kevin the easy questions. In fact, I would encourage otherwise. So with that, I think we're about ready to wrap up, thank all of you. And so thank you for joining us. The replay of the call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter 2011 Mid-Quarter Update Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the fourth quarter of 2011. In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company. In general, I will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segment or end markets, and I will not address details of profit margins. In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information.
As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the Web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
We have narrowed and lowered our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings from our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $3.19 billion and $3.33 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.21 and $0.25. The reductions are due to broadly lower demand across a wide range of markets, customers and products, except for wireless applications processors.
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. I will provide you the opportunity to ask a follow-up question. Operator?

Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Ron, can I just ask you if there are any one-time items that may have impacted the EPS the way it did related to the revenue downgrade?
Ron Slaymaker
Uche, are you asking specifically about why it seems like EPS moved...
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
That is correct.
Richard K. Templeton
Down disproportionate to the revenue? I don't know that I would say -- actually, there are some one-time items. Let me kind of walk through that transition, in general, if I can. First of all, I would say mix is unfavorable. And if you think about it, we actually haven't talked yet about product areas per se, but what I would say is we're seeing downsize versus our expectations in some of the more profitable areas, such as communications infrastructure and some of the catalog analog and Embedded Processing product areas, while at the same time, we're seeing upside in Wireless. So that mix shift is unfavorable to profit margins, and therefore, EPS. I think also impacting us this quarter is utilization, with revenue down more than we had initially expected. We've also further reduced production loadings to avoid building excess inventory. And so as a result, the underutilization expense will be higher this quarter, therefore further pressuring profit margins compared to last quarter. And then finally, maybe to the point you had initially asked. We will have higher acquisition-related expenses by about $20 million, which is about $0.01 per share higher than what we had previously expected.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Now in terms of the -- what changed between the last earnings call and now? Obviously, we know the macro has continued to weaken. But in terms of the expectation that we will have seen a bottoming process forming, are you still willing to stand by that comment even though you've had to lower now? I mean, you've had to recalibrate how you view things from here onwards. In respect to the earlier comments from your last earnings call, how should I think about it?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So let's start with what changed. And again, as I said in my opening remarks, the weakness really is pretty broad-based with the exception of Wireless. So revenue in our Analog, Embedded Processing and other segments is weaker than we had originally expected. If you look at it by end market, communications infrastructure is exceptionally weak. Really, that's being driven by UMTS-based systems in North America as those couple of carriers await the outcome of their proposed merger. Industrial markets also remain weak, and I would say in that space, we have both customers and distributors seemingly pushing component inventory levels to very low levels. In the computing space, computing overall is down with declines at storage or hard disk drive customers, especially exacerbated by the flooding in Thailand. And then consumer product areas, such as televisions and video games are also weak this quarter. I mentioned the one bright spot is Wireless, and there our OMAP revenue is doing very well this quarter. Just as a reminder, we're now seeing the benefit of customer programs that have ramped into production using our latest OMAP 4 processor. Those customer programs include Samsung's Nexus smartphone, which is our first production program based on Google's Ice Cream Sandwich reference design; Samsung's GALAXY S II smartphone, Motorola's DROID BIONIC and RAZR smartphones, LG's Thrill smartphone with its 3D playback and capture feature. And then most recently, the Amazon Fire tablet and the Barnes & Noble NOOK Tablet are both based upon OMAP 4. And then probably the final end market area that I would mention is automotive. And there, I would describe that sales into our automotive applications, we would expect this quarter to be about flat sequentially, which was really about as we had expected. So that's really what changed, Uche.
Operator
We'll go next to Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
I was wondering if you could add some color, if you could, on the order linearity. When did -- did you see cancellations and pushouts? Or is it just turns didn't come in as expected? And how did orders progress month by month for the quarter so far?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Shawn, I would say orders -- total orders likely declined some from the third quarter level. This decline -- excuse me, this decline includes the seasonal impact from calculators, as well as what I would just characterize as lumpiness in baseband. If we just look at our semiconductor products and pull out baseband because of that lumpiness, I would say orders there have generally been moving sideways since the significant drop that we saw in the month of July and that we talked about in our October call. They've been kind of noisy from a month-to-month basis, but the overall trend has been flattish since that period.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
Just on inventories, I was wondering if you could hazard a guess if you think your OEM and your distribution customers are burning inventory now or what your visibility there is?
Ron Slaymaker
All right. Clearly, reducing inventories, and I would say really in both fronts. The distribution, we, obviously, see that data most clearly because we just know what distributors are carrying. And they are continuing to take inventories down, and I would say they have inventories down to very low levels. And our belief is that at the OEM customers, inventory is being reduced and that, in fact, we're undershipping those customers' production levels.
Operator
We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I have actually a longer term question. So in the past year, you have added a significant amount of capacity and I understand these are not shotgun decisions. But structurally, are there actions that you can take to in the downside if macro remains somewhat weak for the next 1 or 2 quarters also?
Ron Slaymaker
You mean specifically in terms of shutting down some of that capacity.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes, because gross margin have taken a big hit over the last several quarters and I'm trying to understand how you can sort of limit downside from here given that the visibility is still somewhat weak out there.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes. In fact, I would just say that's not in our plans. And obviously, there are a lot of options we could do, but especially given our view that we're undershipping demand; therefore, when customers are through with their inventory correction, we will be seeing growth even if there is no growth in end demand or inventory replenishment just as we move back to the customers' production levels. So in that environment and especially considering the low carrying cost of the capacity that we have on board, we have no intention to take any of that, especially the new capacity that we've been bringing on and doing anything other than fill it up over the course of time.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
So one more. You mentioned that you are undershipping demand. So if you looked at historical trends, how long can that situation persist, i.e. is Q4 a bottom? Is Q1 a bottom? How do we get a sense for that based on what you have seen in similar situations before?.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Sure. And I think this ties somewhat back to the question Uche asked maybe, that I hadn't gotten to specifically, which is do we still believe that we're in this bottoming process in the downturn, and the answer is we do. So what we look at, first of all, is that inventory levels of TI just as customers and distributors are now very low, and as I said before, we believe we're undershipping demand. So just to reiterate, at some point, customers will have to stop reducing inventory. And when that happens, our revenue will grow as our shipments increase to match the customers' production level even if there's no growth in end demand or replenishment of inventory. And for anybody that's watched this industry cycle over the course of time, you fully understand that once you start to get in that process and customers regain confidence in their own outlook, the next phase is they will typically then layer in addition inventory as well. The customers historically have not forecast these snapbacks in their demand, and instead, they rely on short product lead times to support their increased demand. We think we are very well positioned both with our inventory, as well as our short lead times to support that inevitable increase in demand. And the other thing that I would point to, which I had mentioned earlier, is just the stability you might say in terms of the orders took a step down in the month of July, but they've generally been flattish since that time, which is to us indicative of a bottoming process as well. I don't have an exact time period. Is it this quarter or is it next quarter as to where that snapback could occur? Historically, if you look at semiconductor inventory corrections, the response time generally results in a couple of quarters of inventory burn. And that's just looking at history. But we'll have to see what this one holds. But I guess I would say we continue to be encouraged that we're in the bottoming process even though demand was a little weaker than what we had initially expected this quarter.
Operator
We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I guess first question is kind of strategically with all the strategic fab capacity that you guys have, how do you think about using that in this kind of environment? Or maybe even more specifically, as things start to bounce back a little bit, do you try to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing to pick up a little bit of that incremental bump in business that you'll see as customers start to normalize the order patterns? Or is it more important you keep pricing pretty steady and try and get the margins back to a more healthy level?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, margins will return to more normalized levels just as we fill that capacity up. So my view is that probably doesn't tie so much to pricing and just a matter of as we ship more units, and therefore, amortize that what currently is an underutilization expense, that will do good things for margins. You've heard us say many times in the past that for the most part, the proprietary product lines that we sell tend to be more spec-elastic versus price-elastic. So even -- we're aggressive in pursuing new opportunities. We tend to do it based on the product specifications that we're offering, the support package, the applications engineering as opposed to thinking that somehow if we drop a couple cents off the price, that somehow that would make a difference in the demand that we actually see. So again, we tend not to view price. Although I will also say, we recognize we have to be competitive on price. And I think we have a cost structure that allows us to be competitive with any of our -- any competitor in the world. So again, I think that's why for our salespeople, price is not an excuse for them to lose a piece of business, but nor is it the reason they should win a piece of business. We want to be competitive on price, but we win the business based on other considerations.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
This question is specifically about Analog. So I understand there's a lot of program ramps and design wins and share gains and apps processors. But relative to the Analog piece of the business, when is it fair for us to measure your share gain story again? In other words, it's always difficult in the downturn to say, well, they're not gaining any share in the downturn. But when is it going to be fair for us to say, look at your revenue share of the industry versus your revenue share in a previous period or cycle and to determine whether the share gain story is kind of playing out?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, I don't know that it's not fair to look at it in a downturn. I mean we look at it every quarter. Now we don't overreact to any particular data point. But I think the right way to do it is to sample it quarterly and we ask ourselves the question, if there's a quarter where we believe we underperform, we ask ourselves why, and frankly, you guys should be asking us why as well. So sample it quarterly and the best way to make the story work over the long term is to make sure it works every quarter. But at the same time, maybe in a downturn like this, you may see more strategic long-term use in terms of share from the standpoint of gaining position at customers on new design programs and things like that, more so than the different show up in revenue that particular quarter. But again, every quarter absolutely counts.
Operator
We'll go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
Ron, you said on your October quarter call, I believe that you said that the distributor inventory is worth 6 weeks and that was at normal levels. It sounds like they're lower now. Given that you have a pretty clear visibility there, can you quantify where they are now? Or at least talk qualitatively about how close they are relative to where they were at the depths of the financial crisis?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't want to try to quantify where distributors are right now until the end of the quarter, Mark, but I think your interpretation of what we're saying is correct, that distributor inventory is going down this quarter. In fact, and maybe if I can just comment on distribution overall, but make some specific inventory comments. If you just look at resales, we would expect resales from distribution to the client compared to the third quarter, although at this point, it looks like they'll decline a little less than TI's revenue would overall if we take the national or the SBA revenue out just because we only had it for, what, a week last quarter. Inventory distributors, we expect to be down by a double-digit percentage at this point. And again, that's compared with the third quarter. Although I'll also say that, that includes inventory returns from a discontinued national distributor. And so that, the returns from that distributor probably will contribute maybe a couple few points of the decline in and of itself. Even without that, you can see there's a pretty sharp decline in distributor inventory levels. Just one data point that I saw that I'll pass on almost anecdotally: if you look at inventory for the products that we would characterize as specific to the industrial market, just in the last couple of quarters, inventory of those products at distributors has been cut in half. So again, the distributors are moving pretty aggressively in terms of reducing inventory. And we all have to watch it because demand can come back pretty quickly. But again, call it the buffer. What we feel comfortable with that is that inside TI, our own inventory, we think we're pretty well positioned. So distributors are tightening up somewhat, but we feel that we have enough buffer inside TI to be able to respond as business comes back again.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
Thanks for that detail. In kind of modeling the cash flow for next year, I guess I have to believe that front-end CapEx will be at maintenance levels, and you've been -- you may or may not have to get back into equipment. One, is that a fair way to think about it? And two, could you give us a sense of what is like a maintenance level of CapEx?
Ron Slaymaker
Maybe one way to look at it overall, Mark, is I think historically, we've guided that we would expect our CapEx to range somewhere between 5% to 8% of revenue. As you pointed out, with the capacity additions we've made and over the past couple of years, I think it's fair. We clearly have pulled in capital spending from future years. We don't need to spend a lot on front-end capacity. And therefore, we would expect to be at the lower end of that range kind of what you said, both capital maintenance on the front end and then additions to assembly test. What I would say is, even assembly test, depending upon growth, as we have more years produced, obviously, we'll need to expand our capacity on assembly test after we refill the existing capacity. And so with utilization both on front end and back end coming back somewhat as we've gone through this downturn, clearly, we have room to grow from current levels before we really even need to spend on back end capacity to any significance.

Ron, you've qualitatively talked about some of your end markets, but could you also do the same for your regions space?
Ron Slaymaker
Sure. I guess, and again, this is just based on the first 2 months of the quarter and extrapolating that through the end of the quarter. But probably no surprise, Europe is currently our weakest region, followed by Asia, and then the U.S. All 3 of those regions, we would expect to be down based upon that 2 months worth of data. Japan, therefore, is the only region that is tracking to be up sequentially, and that's really as it just continues its post-earthquake recovery.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
You talked about the Wireless infrastructure being intentionally weak, and I think you mentioned maybe that's due to some pushouts. Do you have a sense on how those pushouts look like, meaning is it a quarter or is this going to be a multi-quarter pushout?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't know. And I think as I said, it really goes beyond our customers to their customers what the carriers, and I think you're all aware they're trying to merge and how they spend and where they spend will be different based on whether that merger happens or if for some reason it doesn't happen. And so in the interim, while they're sorting that out, they've pretty much stopped spending. So I have no idea how to assess how long that may last, but that's what's currently impacting us there in terms of the decline. Other carriers are flattish. Some of the programs in India or China that we've all talked about and hoped was maybe going to be ramping are still on hold at this point, but actually what's impacting us in terms of the decline would be those North American carriers that I talked about.

We'll go to Christopher Danely with JP Morgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
So one thing you said today that you guys also said on the conference call about a 1.5 month ago is that bookings have essentially bottomed for the last couple of months, but clearly the revenue outlook is worse. I'm just wondering what is the difference there? Or is this just, in your opinion, a massive inventory drawdown by the distis? Are your customers telling you where demand is risky [ph]? Can you sort of parse that out?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, I can -- and I don't know that I can talk too specifically about customer demand. But our assessment is that this is mostly them taking inventory levels down more than what we had expected, as opposed to their demand is significantly weaker than what we had expected.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And have you noticed any, I guess, worse performance from the national versus the legacy TI business? Is there any more downside from national? Do you think any of this is a result of the merger?
Ron Slaymaker
No. In fact, I would say national is declining this quarter, but declining about the same as our HPA revenues. And as you know, both of those areas are catalog products sold through distribution. And I would say they both have relatively strong ties to the industrial market, which is weak right now. But I wouldn't say national is disproportionately a factor one way or the other here.
Operator
We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I guess I'm trying to figure out a little bit better what's going on with gross margins in the December quarter. So I guess can you help me understand if OpEx dollars are kind of flattish with the old model, it implies sort of a 200-basis point drop. If that's the case, what's utilization versus mix? And were you able to do anything on the OpEx line? Or with the national integration, is OpEx kind of a fixed cost this quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. And, John, let me make sure I understand or maybe let me just kind of reiterate what we said last quarter. OpEx I think we said in our October call, our view is that OpEx would go up somewhere in the $160 million to $170 million range. And that was a combination of basically having a full quarter of national OpEx in fourth quarter versus only a week of it in the third quarter. And then also, I think we talked about some of the -- as we had adjusted in light of the environment and forecast some of the variable element of compensation in the third quarter, there were catch-up accruals basically to adjust the cumulative effect for first half. And that catch-up piece of those lower accruals would not, therefore, recur in the fourth quarter. So we said OpEx would be up about $150 million to $170 million. Suffice it to say in this environment, we're going to try to keep a tight control and do better than that. But that's certainly part of it, which is we're not going to be able to do anything about. So OpEx will go up by about that amount. Gross margin, I think, as you pointed out, will be down, but it's also down for the 2 reasons I talked about, mix and then specialty utilization. And then the only other consideration that I should just remind you about is, remember, on cost of revenue, there's about $100 million of additional expense in the fourth quarter that I would describe as acquisition-related. And that's tied to the fair value markup of the inventory that we received from National as part of that acquisition. But that's probably -- those are probably the moving pieces that I can think off to point out at this point. Did that answer your question, John?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I guess as a follow-up, midpoint of revenue coming down by about $140 million. I guess I just want to understand, did Wireless quarter-to-date on the OMAP coming in better than you originally expected at the beginning of the quarter? And can you help us kind of give the magnitudes, if I x out OMAP, what's the rest of the business doing versus expectations at the beginning of the quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, yes. OMAP is doing better than expected. I can't quantify it at this point in the quarter, but I would just say OMAP is growing very nicely, and we'll have more details for you in January. But we expected good growth out of it and it's delivering even better growth. And so other areas are making up -- more than offsetting that growth, and obviously, we've taken the overall guidance down. So they're all doing quite a bit worse than what we had anticipated when we came in. And again, probably for reasons of both macro as well as inventory reduction.
Operator
We'll go next to Craig Ellis of Caris & Company.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
Just an inquiry on the PC related businesses. You mentioned some Thai flooding impact. Is that proving to be a little bit worse than the what the company expected into the quarter or pretty much in line?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, and again, if you go back to what we said in October, we looked our own supply chain's risk both in terms of, I think a lead frame that we bought from a supplier there that we knew would be disrupted, and from assembly test that we had there, and I think we quantified that impact as about 1%. But again, that was just TI supply chain. What we tried to communicate was the first order effect, which was the customer, the direct customer impact of hard disk drive that were manufactured in Thailand. And then maybe even a second order effect of PC manufacturers that couldn't get hard disk drives that might be weaker than otherwise expected. And again, we had some estimates there, but clearly that is having impact, certainly the first order effect. I don't know how much -- we're not the best source to be able to comment on the PC manufacturers. Clearly, they're going to be impacted by the same macro considerations that every other market segment is. So they likely would have been weak anyway. Was that weakness exacerbated by lack of storage? I don't know.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
With one of the design-ins you have with OMAP 4, the Kindle Fire, you've done a good job getting other content in there, like Wi-Fi. As you look at your design-in funnel with Ice Cream Sandwich systems, do you see a greater propensity of those design wins bundling more TI content? Or how do you think about your ability to attach other components when you get that OMAP 4 design win?
Ron Slaymaker
I would describe that as pretty strong, no guarantees, but usually almost always when we win OMAP, we'll have some power management Analog type products attached to it. And then sometimes connectivity. We don't bundle the 2. So there will be places we fill connectivity without OMAP, there will be places we fill OMAP without connectivity and then there will be customers we fill both into. But almost always, when we fill OMAP, customers just find it more convenient to work with TI on a lot of the Analog products, such as power management, as well as our sales force is trained to work their way through those customer systems and pick up as much of that companion Analog content as they possibly can. So I would say when we sell OMAP, we usually do very well selling other products outside of OMAP as well.
Thank you for your questions, and before we end the call, let me remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you and good evening.

That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
All right, good morning. Thank you very much for joining us today. We have with us today, Rich Templeton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Texas Instruments and we've also have Dave Pahl, Director of Investor Relations for TI. Today's formats will be a fireside chat with Rich and I will hope to go for 30 minutes and leave the last 20 minutes for questions from the audience. But before we start, I would like to make an announcement. NVIDIA's presentation today at 12 will be held in Salon 2. It will not be a lunch keynote, we moved the lunch meeting to 1:00. So NVIDIA will be at Salon 2 and lunch will be served at 12:45 or 1:00. 
All right and with that, I'm going to go sit down and Rich and I can start out chat without a fire. All right? Thank you. 
So Rich, thank you very much, thanks for joining us. Do you want to make any opening remarks before we get started?
Richard K. Templeton
No. Uche, it's really an opportunity to give everybody here a chance to ask questions. I know you have an informal list of your own, I would assume, that has been put together. As you know, we're really very excited about what's happening out in the marketplace and at TI these days. We've set forth on a path to really make Analog and Embedded Processing the heart of what we do. You saw a significant announcement earlier this year with the acquisition of National Semiconductor. We closed that in September. And today, we have literally 70% of the company centered up in these key areas of Analog, Embedded Processing and the application processor and conductivity business. 90% of our R&D goes in there. We think they are a great growth opportunities and they are very well proven margin and cash generators as well. And so we continue to move forward and focus on execution.

2011-11-17,Q&A," Session
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Sure. So why don't we start up by going through the little comments submitted in the last earnings calls about starting to see the beginning of the upcoming process, and incidentally, our analysis actually shows that the semiconductor companies have been on the shipping and demand since Q3, but at the same time, there's a de-stocking process going among the key industrial customers. So any comments you can make as to the parameters around which you made that statement.
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. Uche, it really is a very simple set of statements. You go back to the discussion that Kevin and Ron had during the call. What we pointed to -- and I've been in the business, now, 30 years and our team has been in there a long time. We were seeing, as the quarter ended, a slowing down of the decline or the slope of the orders coming in was starting to dampen. You combine that with the fact that lead times are very short today. You then put on top of that, that inventories are actually quite lean and that's usually a pretty good sign that things are getting to ""the bottom or near the bottom."" Obviously, we guided Q4 to be down from Q3. So you really have to take those words into context of the shaping of the bottom as opposed to a single declarative point of here it is. But the Semi industry has been very predictable. And that's when things are strong, people are anxious to have as much inventory as possible, because they're afraid of not making shipments. And when things go on the other side and lead times come in, they go back to old habits again and that usually is a pretty good indicator of what's going to start again. So that's what we're seeing.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Great. Let me just move quickly to National Semi, because this has been a very fundamental deal that's been done this year in the Analog world, probably the biggest we've seen in Semis in this current cycle. Two questions there, when you cast your mind to when you did the Burr-Brown deal, a while ago and then this one, what are the lessons between those 2 and, I know there's been a long time span between the 2 deals, but they are quality and very fundamental in the history of TI. So first question, what are the lessons? And the second question is obviously what are your parameters to get into synergies that were outlined in terms of growth and cost and capacity rationalizations?
Richard K. Templeton
Okay, well let me go through them if I forget something -- Shawn probably prompt me on that. You know the first thing that I think is important is that the context of the acquisitions was different. And what I mean by that was in the case of National, you had what is proved -- what we theorized and now that we've gotten inside and looked closer is a high-quality portfolio with some really high-quality people, but it just did not have the commercial direction and the commercial leadership that was allowing it, as we had talked, the consistency of commercial leadership to allow it to be successful. So it was significantly underperforming. And so, it was a very simple theory of we could take our sales force, our reputation of consistency of direction and combine it with some really great Analog talent and some really great Analog products. And as we talked to a group that Ron and Gregg Lowe and the guys had in the Valley 2 days ago, I think they got a bit of a sampling in the first -- we closed 45-odd days ago, Gregg has taken that set of business unit managers around the world for this infamous world tour. And in that first 45 days, that's our definition of integration. Let's go visit customers. And I think they visited, as they went around the world, over 400, approaching 500, customers; got introductions done with 1,000 TI sales people, I think it was several thousand distributor sales people. When I talked to Gregg Lowe what he got done and, I think he commented that I think he's been -- slept in his own bed 5 nights in the past 45, he doesn't know of a meeting that they held where they didn't have a design in interest, meaning a specific chip on a specific board at the end of that meeting. And that's a pretty good indication that, that theory has been true and we ought to be able to do pretty well on that. Now, I contrast that, if you think back to Burr-Brown in 2000, it wasn't an underperforming asset, it was pretty well run at that time, had good skills. So what we had to do there were some different things and TI was in a different state in terms of our maturity as an Analog company. And so, in that case, if you go back and look at even some of the early analyst meetings, we talked about defining some new process technology together because they had some very keen insight, what high performance meant. And the things that had to be done for data converters. And so the things that we were after from a synergy point of view and strategically we're very different then what we're taking advantage on the national deal. 
 
The last one, and boy, it's almost answered in the introduction I gave on National; remember that Gregg Lowe was in the heart of the Burr-Brown and the Unitrode activity. So he was sitting there watching all the things that we did, John Szczsponik that runs all of our worldwide sales today was inside the Analog sales team at that time. So one of the great benefits we had, and we felt this would really help us was we had a lot of lessons of should've, could've as a great way to look back in life, and now let's apply those. So very simple things like, we were fully prepared integration-wise day 1, websites were linked, everybody knew what their jobs would be for the long-term. We went out and spent 45 days out selling with National, not spending the time discussing roadmaps internally. Organizationally, Gregg Lowe is literally out running that fourth business, the Silicon Valley Analog or the National business because we learned that the best way to meet the people, know the people and know the products is go live with them. Don't try to sit back in Dallas and judge what's happening, but go out in the middle of that. So you're seeing a number of things that will really benefit us because we have the continuity of people that were involved in some pretty big acquisitions and integrations 10 years ago and right at the front of this one.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
And in terms of the growth synergies, obviously, one of the comments that was made at the time when the deal was announced was how this would help you grow faster than the industry. So with all that been done and granted it's a little bit early to start measuring some of these parameters, are you still confident at still being able to grow at a rate much faster than the Analog industry?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. I would tell you that the -- it's one thing to study, meaning go through the products and study from the outside, confidence in the products, judging that the people look like they're high-quality, and it's a second thing to now be inside and see it in real life and visit customers with the -- and just see the knowledge, the level of respect, the hunger by our customers. I mean, if I've had 1, I've had 30 visits myself where people are literally saying we love the National product, we just couldn't deal with their commercial behavior. It's now okay to design it in and we're changing what we're doing. I couldn't ask for a more encouraging setup on that. So the guidelines that we had said, where we believe we can get this deal to pay back within 3 years and we had kind of laid out some growth plans of when we would have the National team performing at the level we expect of the TI team, we have no reason to believe that we can't be on that and I will assure all investors that they can probably guess the internal expectations that we have on ourselves and we have on the team out there are even higher than what we modeled or what we've talked about. And now we've got to go to take the great energy and the great early start and we're pretty simple. It's time to convert it into results.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Just one last question on this subject before I move on, one of their concerns obviously was about the product overlap, you're both fairly successful in the high-performance Analog space, and to what extent are you seeing overlap that needs to be eliminated? I mean, right now the top line is interesting to see because we believe that you can, in many ways, deliver some of the benefits, that is we'll get them done on the cost side is kind of where all feel not very clear as to how much cost can be taken out of product overlap areas.
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. So be very clear because it's a topic -- I think they covered even Wednesday or Tuesday this week, when everyone was out there. If you look at the overlap, we had kind of ballparked it as 5% to 10% and that was by studying products and studying overlays and everything that we see, say, that it is a pretty good estimate, maybe even at the 5% side of that as opposed to the 10%. The biggest point that I have made, and I've made it to the National team, I've made it to the TI folks internally and all investors is we're really pretty simple about product overlap and that is, if I find out we have 2 groups calling on a customer, my only question is who won? And people are like, what do you mean? But that really is the culture we want because what you'll find is the group whose product wins will end up being the leader in that area. And the group was product whose product didn't win, will take those resource and direct them to a better opportunity internally. And that adjustment actually happens really quickly in our business and in the cycle on that front. So what Gregg had theorized and we had guessed then it's going to turn out to be very accurate, we're not going to have to do a bunch of refereeing of this is overhead, this is duplicate or this is not. He's made a couple of minor adjustments that were obvious to start out and he's often running. On the cost synergy, we talked very clearly that we should be able to get $100 million of cost synergy out of the National deal. But that would be primarily and significantly on the SG&A side, that's where you just have duplication and corporate structures and corporate functions. And we said that $100 million would be realized on a run rate basis a year after close. And I just, I cannot compliment our team enough. They had all those decisions and all that communication and all that done on Thursday before the close on Friday, back September 23 or whatever that was. And it's the speed and decisiveness, it's also the right human thing, meaning people know what they're future is and that helps teams work together well. So that looks very good, we really have no plans to have a bunch of R&D synergy, in fact, if we have areas, as I commented before, where one group is working on a chip that's close to another one, I just want them shifting a little bit to the left or right and go pick a more unique area. These are talented people, let's turn them lose to design great parts for us.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
That's fantastic. Can I just switch to OMAP? In the vision you articulated of Analog and Embedded Processing, OMAP has been one area that obviously fits within the Embedded Processing story. Of late, there's been a lot of success with the new OMAP products, you've been designing to a lot of the new Ice Cream Sandwich Android products, Samsung, Kindle. Can you talk about 2 things here? The first is, when I look at the competitive dynamics within OMAP, of the top 3 players, you are the one without an architectural license. QUALCOMM does, NVIDIA does. And to what extent is that an advantage or a disadvantage for you not to have an architectural license? Obviously, you're usually the first -- one of the first licensees on the next new ARM core, but I just want to see how that sits within the competitive dynamics, that's the first question. And then two, what do you attribute to the recent success you've had have coming back and searching into some of these new Ice Cream Sandwich products and how sustainable can that be?
Richard K. Templeton
Uche, there'll always be debate on subjects like this, is it good or bad to have an architectural license? So I realized you can have other people and they'll tell you why it's critical. I'll tell you I think it's dangerous to have it. And I've had customers tell me the same thing. Because when you take something from ARM and then change it, it's going to take more time to get to market. And the only thing I'd guarantee at the end of people changing it, is that it's different. Now the designer that changed it is probably going to tell you that it's better, but it's later and it's different. And so, in a world where you want to have consistency on the ARM-based code, okay? And I have to be very careful the way I say that, when you want to have consistency on the ARM-based code, I don't think it's a great strategy. In fact if you look at things that we do, we typically will be first to market with the newest generation of core from ARM, because we don't change it. So we get it done sooner. And so, I think you're going to find that, that tends to prevail, you'll see us do it again with OMAP 5 with the latest Eagle Core that comes out of ARM accordingly. So we'll be first to market, I think, first still really matters in this business. So it will go a long way. The second side of that and in that question of kind of why have we had success and how sustainable is it or some people want to know how sticky is the Android success that you have? The fact is, I think, the most important thing that Greg Delagi and Remi and his team have done and you've seen them do it consistently throughout the generations of OMAP, is I think they've got a great team that knows how to look out ahead and deliver performance and power and balance. This is a mobile world. This is not about cores and it's not about megahertz. It's about the user experience per unit of milliwatt of power per cost. And that team has done a great job of looking out ahead, knowing what multimedia trends, what browser requirements, what audio decode, all the things that are going to be required on that phone platform and then designing a very special platform. What to accelerate, not on the ARM core, so that it gets done faster on lower power. And I think what they've achieved is because of that capability, they have been able to get selected as the lead platform by the Android guys several times. And you've also watched us get accepted by Microsoft as the lead platform on Windows 8. And while a lot of people may dismiss it, I think there still -- we'll have to see, we have the lead in primary platform with the QNX folks inside of RIM. And it's important to have the world's best operating systems on your platform. It just lets you go more places. So I think it's great to be there. I think it's great to have a team that can look ahead. I think they've got a great software compatible roadmap through devices inside of the OMAP 4 family and the coming OMAP 5 family. And what I'll tell you relative stickiness is, it helps to be there first today, but it's not a guarantee. And I think what that it'll come down to is that we've got to execute well, we've got to be working closely with the Google team and with our OEMs and make sure that we're continuing to bring them the most competitive platform. And I think if we do that well, we'll enjoy the benefits of that.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
I'm going to come to the Windows platform a little bit later, but can I just point to something that has been raised as an issue? One is, you are working there around the baseband business, having decided to shut that business down a couple of years ago and NVIDIA, which is one of the platforms selected by Microsoft, just bought Icera and QUALCOMM, obviously, started up live as a baseband company. You are the only one of the 3 that doesn't really have a baseband strategy, if I had to put it that way. As we now migrate to more low-cost smartphones, where integration seems to be a key parameter, is that a market that you think you could still play, not having an integrated product, obviously? And how do you see the dynamics playing at, even within the higher end smartphone market where there has been an argument from QUALCOMM that you're going to need more integration into those markets. Any comments you can make there?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, Uche, as you know, the debates about integrated and not integrated have been going on for 4 or 5 years. And we had a lot of people 5 years ago that said there's no market for discrete app processor and look at what's taking place today. And so I think we will continue to see that as a very healthy marketplace for discrete and that's inside the smartphones, obviously, you get into tablets it's with a very different architectural decision. And so I think you'll find discrete is the dominant platform for a very long time on the tablet front. So inside smartphones, I think you'll see a lot of headroom and a lot of runway in terms of the discrete. The second thing that I go to, haven't been around a long time, baseband is simply a destroyer of capital. Integrating a destroyer of capital into your business model doesn't make it better. And it isn't easy taking a business like baseband and you know how big it was and how successful we were at it and saying we're going to go without it. But it's also a heck of a lot better than trying to embrace a business where there's, at last count, 10 different competitors in the baseband business. And as I've just learned too often in this business don't let that be a reason to go do something. Go work on the products that are truly going to differentiate the device. And that's going to be the application processor and that's going to be the connectivity, and so we feel pretty good about where we are.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
That's very interesting that you raised that point, let me just switch to Microsoft, and I'm going to come back to the subject of baseband again later on in the conversation. Within the Microsoft base Windows 8 program, that has -- ARM has now been selected and you, NVIDIA and QUALCOMM are the top 3 that was selected to play in that market. That market is supposed to span both handsets, tablets and PCs. How do you prioritize the 3 of them? Have you chosen where not to play? There has been suggestions that you will not be playing in the PC market, or even in the server markets, which is kind of where some of the ARM guys think they can extrapolate the ARM core into. So any commentary as to where you want to play within the whole continuum of Windows 8.
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, I'll go even beyond it's been suggested, I'll reinforce it's a very clear decision. You take your products where they're designed to be great and so, where Gregg and Remi and that team are doing is Windows 8 into the mobile side. So think of tablets or different formats or form factors around that, could be smartphone variants, that's where we will focus our energies when it comes to Windows 8. And there are companies that will go attack back up into the traditional notebook or traditional desktop or, even as you said, some taking a look at the server space. And I think those are certainly logical opportunities, I think ARM has a great advantage going into some of those markets, but we will clearly prioritize our R&D in that direction. And we'll do it because when we look at this overall application processor space, yes, smartphones are important, yes, tablets are huge, but we also, as you've seen us do for 15 years in the wireless space, we want to look through to the longer-term trends. And the longer-term trends that I think are very obvious is the next thing that people will spend time talking about is the impact of cloud-based services. And when you think about a world, 5 years from now, with extensive cloud-based services, it's going to lead to a wide variety of devices and some of those are smartphones and some of those are tablets or specialty tablets, but there's 85 million automobiles in the world. There's home automation in the world. There's set-top box and media players. People are going to want to watch and view their information and stream that information not to one part but to actually, it could be a dozen different devices. So we want to make sure with that world emerging is that we have got the most important operating systems that could be players out in that time frame, certainly Android is going to likely be one, we think Microsoft with Windows 8, they take that kernel and move it further out into the embedded space. So when you hear Greg Delagi even week talk about building a horizontal or broader market for OMAP and for connectivity, it's with that vision and that view in mind. So this is not about aiming backward to the last decade's product but really looking out to where we think the world's going on that front.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
So let me be sure it is clear, that PC is not a priority within it.
Richard K. Templeton
That is correct.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
On the subject of baseband closure and I know you talked about destroying capital within that business, and of watched TI walk away from business that are huge -- the DRAM business, you walked away at the right time for the DRAM business before the whole thing imploded...
Richard K. Templeton
And here, you could debate 10 years earlier would've been even better, but ...
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
But at least the timing was still great because subsequent to that, the industry just literally shrunk for basebands, the timing also and it's time to walk away from what at a time had proven to be a profitable business for you was a very interesting decision, but the problem though still, that business still continues to grow for you in the 3G area. Why is it being difficult for the partners having named by Nokia to take a bow from you, because last quarter it actually still grew. So I just want to understand as you decide to close that business, why did it take you so long for you to walk away and should we still be look at 2013 as when you should walk away from that business?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. Uche to me it's very simple. We -- I forget when we had talked about the 2013 time. I'll bet we probably got specifics somewhere in 2009 and the multisource announcements were sometime in 2008. And we said essentially assume that by '13 it's 0. That's still a good assumption today. And people ask what's the shape of the curve and we said draw a straight line and all we promise you is it's wrong. And that will be a function of Nokia's success in the market, the mix of what they're shipping and the rate at which they get other people in place. And so, I don't, and I don't encourage people, don't over interpret. Yes, baseband was down in 2Q and backup in 3Q, I think that far more has to do with what Nokia was manufacturing and building at that time as opposed to any big strategic implication. So we are well on our way to -- you could assume that number is going to be very close to 0 by '13.

Is there still any IP left in that business you can monetize going forward, and I say that because when I look at DRAM you still generate a reasonable royalty stream in the DRAM market. If you look at handsets, is that kind of similar on the baseband side?
Richard K. Templeton
Well if you look -- and be careful, because we don't necessarily couple that IP with where it was created. But we are a very significant holder of a lot of fundamental wireless pads including in the 4G or LTE world. So at the company level, the TI pad portfolio, which 20 years ago its crown jewels were DRAM patents, you've watched that diversify and the reason we have such a strong portfolio is our very creative engineers over time who filed patents as we have innovated in a lot of these spaces. So that IP will be well protected and used to make sure that we have A, the freedom to operate but it will also generate a very nice ongoing stream of royalty for us.

Let me switch to Embedded Processing and I'm probably going to take it by subsegments. So, in the com infrastructure business, that's been an area where you've been very, very strong, but last quarter, that business declined double digits and for many reasons. It obviously -- we've seen what's going on in Europe and even within the U.S. there were certain delays. What is your sense as to how that business plays out and I'm not trying to get you to give us a guidance for next year, but if you look through the conversations you have with your customers, how do you see that business playing out short-term, medium-term, longer-term and out, if you would? Other question I want to ask is to the interplay between you and the PLD companies?
Richard K. Templeton
If you -- and I'll give kind of a mid and a little longer-term, so think 3 and 5 years maybe. I made the comment before when we were talking about the handset and our view on application processors and look out for world of cloud computing and what the implications are in terms of devices, and that's an exciting area for us. I will tell you equally excited with a cloud computing vision of the world is the plumbing that has to go into making it work. And that plumbing ranges from servers, to wireline, backhaul and, yes, a very extensive communications interface or a com infrastructure world that will take place from a wireless perspective. We're a big participant in the infrastructure of the base station business, as it gets called, and so when we look out to that world, we see it as if still a very exciting and expanding market. In the near-term you will see and it's done this for 15 years as tenders come out and go away, it will tend to have waves of up and down, but you kind of look at the line that's the secular growth that goes through that, and that's still very strong. The next thing that you're going to see and we're very well-positioned to benefit from it, is you're going to find as the world of LTE evolves, is you're going to find a whole small cell or femto, a lot of different names you could put around it. But basically, where the cell sizes get smaller so you can get the traffic density and it could be either for an enterprise or even private but more citywide metro deployment on that. And so, when you start thinking about what the base station count would do in a small cell environment, we get very excited about. It's got a great content from a multicore DSP system point of view. It also has great Analog content, so think data converter, off-vamp [ph], RF Front Ends, these are very sophisticated pieces of equipment and they're full of a lot of the things that we tend to do very well. So we are excited in terms of both the intermediate and the longer-term. That business, like most of them, never goes just steady up quarter after quarter. It'll roll up and down depending on the tenders by the service providers at that time. But we love the direction.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
And do you see femto as complementary or as kind of alive in micro cells?
Richard K. Templeton
No, I think it's going to be very complementary. When you look at how it will happen and if you spend time with the leaders in the industry, you will see how you really have to have a macro down through femto strategy to handle different demographics, different densities, different deployments on into enterprise, so it is going to be something where -- what our customers love about our approach is we can provide a scalable and software-compatible solution. So the extensive investment that they have to make is in software. And they want to be able to take that investment and be able to scale it from the largest systems down to the smallest systems. And so a company like TI, they can handle the processing demands of that and still scale them to give them options, we tend to be a perfect partner for that.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Fantastic. Hard disk drives, you've been a very good player in the hard drive business for some time but let me just start sort of asking you your thoughts on the whole Thailand flood issue. We've seen a better resilient supply-chain with Japan, bounce back fairly quickly, but Thailand seems to be a slightly different situation. Any commentary as to what you're seeing in Thailand, what is TI's exposure both direct or indirect and in terms of the conversations of late as to how the supply chain is trying to deal with this, maybe that's just helpful?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, obviously I can be more definitive about impact on TI and than you have to speculate as you get out into the broader supply-chain. We don't have direct operations in Thailand. We do have some subcontractors. They represent less than 1% of revenue, very small percent of the units. But that matters because if you're one of our customers, or on one of those units, that's a really important unit. And we look in pretty good shape, I saw one of the guys just on Wednesday before I took off, because we've been working this pretty closely, we have alternatives and plans put in place where we think we can get most of our customers through all of those issues just because we have the flexibility because that percent of our units is pretty low. We can get it moved somewhere else or work with that subcontractor to have it done in a different place. So from a TI point of view, it looks like it's pretty navigable relative to where we are. Some people as you pointed out starting it, we are a big supplier to the disk drive industry on both the preamp, which is not as closely impacted, but on the -- well the preamp is closely impacted, servo not as much. And we see the speculation of what the unit shortages will be in Q4. That's also a pretty agile channel. And you're watching them adjust inventories and volumes. So I don't know what the exact impact will be on the drive industry and therefore, upstream into the PC industry. But my guess is people usually find ways to get through it. Our best guess is what really matters is when does Thailand start operating again. And best input we're starting to have is the water has been coming down, they are getting the dykes fixed and more pumping taking place in some of the parks. If you kind of work the north of the city, further north, it gets wetter as you go further north. Those are starting to get dried out and our guess is you'll see operations back in February and we should be okay on that front. But we'll have to watch. Just like we saw in Japan, and we were clearly impacted very directly in Japan where the wafer fabs. The world makes a lot about people saying I'm going to take market share from somebody or somebody's going to gain it or lose it and there's more noise made around the event and less positions really changed during it, and we've got a pretty agile set of supply chains and customers and I think they're all pretty busy trying to navigate. So let's get out into January and we'll get a better sense.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Automotive has been one of the areas obviously was directly impacted by Japan and we've seen a little bit of a good resurgence following the whole Japan issue being resolved now. Hardly some of the growth is a catch up from the disruption in Q2. When do you think we will regress to the main in terms of trending back to a more in-trend growth? And if we allude to automotive, how are you seeing the demand trends, medium-term, on the line beyond the inventory stock and post Japan?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. Uche, we've got a great automotive business but it's not across every end OEM and every chassis and every device. My guess, just knowing time constants of supply chains, you ought to be getting pretty close to that when you get 9 months past the event, I think we're probably just intuitively, you're probably near that. The thing I'll tell you that has me excited about automotive, and I think it gets lost in 2011 because the story tends to be more the earthquake or recovery, is when I look out over a 5- and 6-year period, and I look at the impact of infotainment coming into cabins of cars, this is a big trend because consumers are being exposed to products that we work on like smartphones or tablets. And people are simple, I want to be able to take that experience into the car. I should be able to watch my movie, listen to my music and should all just connect up and work and that ought to get done. And that ends up, I think, being a great kind of 5-year medium-term growth opportunity. You look at some areas that we're working, it falls under this whole driver-assistance world of lane changing, of forward collision, of parking assist, these types of things use DSP and processing capability. That is going to be a large growth opportunity over a 5- and 6-year period. The other piece that, I think, is missing here in the U.S. is China is going to be the automotive unit grower. It's probably sitting at 18 million units annually, total global volume of 85 million. But China talks about potentially that number doubling in not too many years and these are not de-contented cars, these are full up, braking systems, suspension systems, infotainment, driver assist. These are going to be great opportunities for companies that have the right products and we tend to be well-positioned because we have the kind of mobile consumer perspective that OMAP brings us and then you combine that with our Analog and microcontroller expertise and our DSP expertise and then put it together with the fact that we're a long-term supplier of the automotive industry, and we think those add up to a good opportunity. So we've got a lot of hope on that.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
That's fantastic. Can I just -- one more question on Embedded Processing before we get into the balance sheet and the use of cash, as the next line of questioning. 16-bits and 32-bits micro products for you, since some competitors start to come into that market of late Microchip has become a player in the 32-bit market. Finally, there has been some surveys that's put them at the top of the design -- engineer-designer preference. Question for you here, you have not been in the 8-bit market, you've entered the 16- and 32-bit market. Are there any opportunities for you in terms of growth between the tablets? Well, how do you differentiate between where your 16-bit goes and where 32-bit goes because the 2 tend to overlap each other once in a while? And then 2, how do you view the competitive elements in this market as we start to see the resurgence of, say, Microchip in that market? It hasn't really been a player?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes, a couple of things, the highest level comment is, if we had -- and I've had some meetings this week and even today's discussion, it's usually Analog, Analog, OMAP, OMAP, OMAP and then if time remains, Embedded, and I'm okay. My encouragement or reminder I provide to investors is I think they're going to find Embedded continues to just grow, make a lot of money and generate a lot of cash. And my guess is, one of these days, it might actually make it to the second slot, the question is on that front. And when we look at the interest that we see from customers and our sales force, on where we're going with the Embedded Processing strategy, it feels very good today. And we've obviously been a long-term leader in DSP, so some people say that's not a surprise, well it's also good that the teams are doing the right things to grow that. The part where I am so encouraged is that Brian Crutcher and his team have really put together a winning strategy in microcontrollers. So some people say it's a 16- and 32-bit discussion, if you look at our 430 family, it addresses the 8-bit and 16-bit market. And so when people ask how is it differentiated, it is ultralow power, it is very cost effective and you get down to where you can literally get into toothbrushes, razors, automotive applications, the spectrum of places you can take that 8- or 16-bit product are very wide. It's a multibillion-dollar tale. we have the opportunity to build a billion-dollar a year business on that front. And the guys are well on their way to doing it. And if you look at what sets us apart from anybody else -- because there's been people in the 8-, 16-bit market for 30 years, is we have got the world's most modern and lowest power processor with the best peripherals and the best memory. And that's what really ends up winning in the microcontroller market. In the 32-bit world, we had made an acquisition now, I forgot, 3-odd years ago to accelerate our entry into the 32-bit and the team continues to gain momentum and, again, it comes down to very simple thing in microcontroller world and that is great cores, great peripherals, great memory options and put good customer support around it and Brian and his team are well along the way on that front. We've got another member of that family that doesn't get talked about much, it's a very high-speed embedded controller, it's the C2000 family, and it's been one of the wonderfully quiet stars inside that portfolio as it goes into applications like motor control. The world has a lot of motors; many of the industrial motors have historically had no electronics in them for 80 years. And they run at a single speed. Well this whole advent of variable speed control, the motor turning only at the rate needed for the work being done, our C2000 family does that work very, very well. And we've been fortunate to be growing with some of the top air conditioning companies, top solar inverter companies, people like that have been focused in that area. So we are really pleased with that kind of 3.8 -- 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and the high-end 32-bit, so that strategy lets us take an offering that actually none of the microcontroller players have. Microchip doesn't cover that front as good as they are, the other incumbents, to free scales around -- nobody touches the breadth that we have on that. So we've got to just stay focused and execute.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Actually, I'm glad you observed it. Analog is above growth. So we decided to spend some time to remind you people there's more to TI and just so on the high-volume, high-performance Analog business. So quickly let me switch to use of cash, so post acquisition, what are your priorities now for use of cash within TI? Between what acquisitions, dividends, share buyback and CapEx?
Richard K. Templeton
Yes. Uche, it's really unchanged. Where if you would've asked that even prior to the National acquisition, we're very simple when we sit with the board and that is, number one is growth. And growth could be CapEx for manufacture equipment, growth could be acquisition, growth could be R&D, growth could be SG&A, the things that you want to invest to drive it, to drive the company. When you look at where we are, I feel very good and what I mean by good, the R&D levels, where the R&D is going. I look at the acquisition we certainly talk about National, I think it's going to be a wonderful move. We're going to love it in the near-term and love it in the long-term. But we've got work to go do on that. And then third, I think one of -- and I think the investor community has seen it, and I hope they just remember and keep it in mind, the move we made in 2009 and '10 to go secure what turns out to be about $5 billion of assets for $500 million. These 3 wafer fabs they're inside the P&L they're operating, they're obviously not fully loaded, given where the industry is right now. But that is going to position us to generate tremendous growth with very little CapEx incrementally. And that's -- my world says that's a pretty good thing to have. Most of our competitors, in fact, a very few of them have got that ability to grow upwards and the cash flow implications when we grow this place it's going to be pretty good accordingly. Once you get past those, and I think we've got those well covered, it then comes down to a balance of dividend and share buyback. We said following the National acquisition that we would moderate share buyback but not eliminate and you've watched us over the past couple of quarters that we've done pretty much that. And so, we were absolutely fortunate in terms of the timing of the National acquisition to be able to secure the financing at the rates we did. And that was a great thing. So there was no rush to pay any debt off in terms of the rates we have it. So our focus will be to generate the cash and then take a good look at the balance of dividends and balance of buyback, you've seen us on the dividend front grow it for I think 7 years now. We continue to step that up and we are a believer that dividends are an important element of return to investors. And I think a great, well-run tech company can actually deliver growth, can deliver equity opportunity, but also could have a dividend component to it.

I promised to allow a few questions from the audience. We have some microphones in the room, if anybody has any question, please raise your hand, get the microphones over to you. Right at the back, over there.
Unknown Analyst
For the final few years, in the National independent company there's some chatter that the margin structure was too high and that was one of the reasons that they were losing share. But it seems that your team has actually discovered that, that's more because of their commercial execution. So having gone inside National, at this point, what do you think would be the best thing to do at National's margins in order for you to maximize the profit?
Richard K. Templeton
So the first comment I would make is, I would never use the statement ""too high"" when it comes to margins. Okay? I think if you look at what occurred and I think the National folks will tell you this pretty directly, you can go back and listen to historical conference calls, even in 2007 and 2008 timeframe. Is not that they had high gross margins but they kept trying to optimize or maximize gross margin percent as opposed to maximize earnings growth. And therein, I believe, lied the core problem that they had, they've got great parts, great parts could earn high margin, but they had some initiatives as we've looked even further inside where because they got very enthusiastic about their margin improvement back in 2006 and '07 they did some things that they probably wish they hadn't done and a lot of it has to do with their commercial posture to customers. So we're not going up and down the hallways of Nationals saying, ""Lower margins"" I can assure you. What we're doing is going through the halls of National as witnessed by the world tour; get out and sell, grow with the customer and be aggressive. And those will lead you to probably being able to still have very good margins but a growing revenue base that you can put alongside of that. And the good news was we had that thesis as we studied it from outside and everything that we have discovered as we've gone through so far is very consistent with that, which gives us comfort that the speed that we can move to that, to a different way to operate, will actually happen very quickly. The biggest thing that I remind people of and in some ways this world is simple, National has great Analog design engineers. We've got great Analog design engineers. The number one thing that great designers want to do is see their parts successful. They want to see their parts in customer's applications and growing. And so the enthusiasm that we've seen from the National community about ""TI coming in,"" has been very high. Because what they see is an opportunity to do what they haven't been able to do for the past 2 or 3 years. And that's where I continue to feel pretty encouraged by what we've found.
Unknown Analyst
Two real quick questions. On National, just curious as far as the company itself, is there much overlap or have they gotten you into any product areas that you haven't been in before? And as far as there are 150-millimeter, 200-millimeter fabs assuming you operate them as a stand alone for the time being, whether it is the endgame of to eventually fold them into that the 300-millimeter that you're building. And secondarily, kind of a separate subject, I was just curious as far as DLP and kind of its future within TI, where you see that heading?
Richard K. Templeton
Let's see if I could keep those on the top of my head. First off, and Dave you need to tell me, are the slides that the guy showed at the Wednesday session up on the web or not, they were only at the session? Out at the meeting that we held on Wednesday, we walked through those business units and gave some very good examples where there was capability that complements TI that we did not have. I think there was some low noise, data converters, lower. I forget the exact devices on that front. But you'll find a very complementary set, especially in the signal chain that can match up to some of the processors. They had and we talked about it at announcement, you look at the power area, they tend to have higher voltage ranges so it tends to be better optimized for industrial. One of the great things that we wanted out of the National deal was to take us closer and deeper into the industrial market. And everything that we see is saying that they're going to be able to do that for us. So we feel pretty good along those lines. On the wafer fab commentary, and I'll go ahead toss the assembly test site, they've got 2 wafer fabs: one in Portland, one in Scotland. Portland is all 8-inch, Scotland is almost fully converted to 8-inch, we have a very simple plan and it's back to that prior question, and that is to go sell and get them loaded up. We do think, there are some things that we can do working with the teams at those 2 sites to get their cost per wafer better but the sites look competitive and we think we've got good line of sight on how to run them well, same with the assembly test site. Lastly on DLP, it's one of those interesting ones were I think to many in the investment community, is the DLP TV era wound down 3 or 4 years ago. It wasn't going to be  -- everybody tended to commiserate that no growth would occur. And that business is actually back to prior record highs in terms of revenue and that is combination of the front projector space, the digital cinema space, but there's also some very exciting new growth areas. You read about these Pico projectors. These miniaturized devices a company just announced just kind of a sled product that would attach to a cell phone. You could find them now embedded on camcorders, so that if you shoot video you could play back and show people. Back to one of Uche's questions, we see applications in the automotive space for heads up displays and other areas as well. So even though DLP is in the other segment, we actually -- it is an area that is getting R&D. It's an area where we've got quite a bit of excitement in terms of potential revenue growth.
Unknown Analyst
How many parts do you guys produce now on an annual basis? And if you lowered all of the factors that you have bought over the last couple of years how many parts would you be producing? And what percent of the industry would that be?
Richard K. Templeton
And you're after units? Okay. Oh, in round numbers we're probably 20 billion units annually right now, maybe 22 billion. It's a 5 billion to 5.5 billion unit a quarter, but we've got the ability to probably do 7 billion with where we are today. And in terms of the percent of the market, you'll actually find it's pretty proportional on a revenue basis because TI's average selling price is about what the overall industry is. When you go look at the deeper math on that particular front. So we're not exceptional, we're not out of line, either lower ASP or higher ASP, when you blend everything together and that's where you've got to be very careful. You've got to add it all up accordingly.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Just one last question because we're almost out of time. That's fine. Rich, why don't I just conclude by just asking you a couple of real quick comments on the business model, how you see it shaping up eventually, if you were to quickly remind people where you see this business from a business model perspective, top line growth related to the industry, margins and how confident you are from what you've seen so far of getting there in mix in it?
Richard K. Templeton
Uche, as you know, we have talked in general, and I think if you look at the pieces we've shown that we have the ability to do what we have called this 2x the market, which we have defined because we have a lot of engineers. We, in general, believe that the semiconductor market probably has an 8% average growth rate over the long-term. And there's a reasonable history that can prove that, and I think if you, depending on your assumptions for long-term global GDP, I think because of more electronics in our lives, semiconductor industry probably grows at about 8%. So we believe that we can take our Analog and Embedded businesses, including the OMAP and connectivity and really grow those at an 8-percentage point faster than the market. It's an audacious statement in some ways, and it's a statement that, depending on the investor, gets met cynically. And I accept that. But it's also something that we've got very firmly in front of us in terms of what we intend to go do. And we've got a significant portion of our business that is capable of doing it and has proven can do that over time and the ones that aren't, guess what? We're off working on those. If you look at that, the best way to understand it is back in 2006, 52% of TI's revenue were in those core categories of Analog and Embedded and OMAP and connectivity. Today it's over 70%. And so during that timeframe we've actually been very close to pushing those types of levels that we have described. So we intend to keep pushing on that. If you look at the fall through for the margin, and this is another one that gets somewhat touchy depending on the investor, is we provided a business model guideline, well, I think it was like the 2007 or the 2008 analyst meeting. And at that time, we said a well-run portfolio of Analog and Embedded Processing should be able to achieve 55 points of gross margin and 30% pretax. And as we started getting near that a year ago or so, we started getting into the okay, let's raise the bid and the cheering from the audience, and we haven't. And the reason we haven't is, and it's almost back to the National question, I don't think good things come out of putting single point models up on the wall, what we intend to do is grow the earnings faster than the revenue and hopefully grow the revenue faster than the market. And what will that exact gross margin be? What will that operating margin be? We're not sitting there saying, here's a single point to be able to drive that. You can go look at well-run Analog models and well-run Embedded Processing or microcontroller businesses and get a sense of what that could be and we certainly know those numbers and we certainly hold people to types of benchmarks. We're not running around trying to lower the GPM or the operating margin, but we are careful about getting a single point up on that wall. So I will, yet again, be evasive on the gross and the operating model.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Yes, I hear you. This has been terrific. Thank you very much, Rich. In behalf of UBS, thanks for coming. I appreciate it.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for December 8. At that time, we expect to adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate. This is a complex earnings report primarily because we have a soft demand environment and a significant acquisition with accounting implications. We've taken extra effort to provide clarity and transparency.
In today's call, we'll give you an update on our progress with the National acquisition and explain the associated costs and accounting. We'll cover the demand environment for the third and fourth quarters, and we'll provide detailed transitions for earnings per share. On our website, we also provide you additional detail to assist in understanding the combination of TI and National.
We have closed the National acquisition on September 23. In addition to the usual activities of integration, the first leg of a World Tour has been completed through Asia. Our Analog manager, Gregg Lowe, and his team of National business managers have already held many meetings with the TI's sales force, with distributors and most importantly, with customers. The power of the combined portfolio is being confirmed. Distributors are committing more dedicated resources to TI and the strong analog portfolio. Customer feedback is almost universal, where National's design-in position had been shrinking over the past 3 years due to their commercial posture. Customers nonetheless love the products and are ready to immediately reengage. The World Tour will continue over the next 3 weeks as we aggressively work to show customers the benefits of our combined portfolios.
Let's move now to the demand environment, which was weak in the third quarter. Revenue was flat sequentially in quarter, when historically it has grown on average about 7%. That being said, we were encouraged that revenue landed above the high end of our range of expectations due to a stronger-than-expected month of September. Our book-to-bill ratio was below one for the quarter, and we expect revenue to again decline more than seasonally in the fourth quarter. Even with this outlook, we see conditions that suggest the bottoming process has begun. After a sharp drop in July, the rate of decline in orders slowed considerably in August and September. Lead times are short, and inventories at distributors and OEMs are lean.
On average, our semiconductor product revenue in a fourth quarter would be about flat sequentially. And our total revenue would decline about 3% due to the seasonal pattern in calculator sales. This fourth quarter, excluding National, we expect our semiconductor revenue to decline about 7% at the middle of our range, and total revenue to be down about 10%. When including a full quarter of National's revenue, semiconductor revenue should be about flat at mid-range and the company down about 3% because of calculator seasonality.
Our acquisition of National was an important step in our strategy to further strengthen our position in the analog semiconductor market. National's 12,000 products enhance our product portfolio. TI had 30,000 analog products before the acquisition and will introduce about 500 new products in 2011. These additions to our portfolio meaningfully accelerate our product strategy. Similarly, the addition of 5,000-plus employees, many of whom have deep and hard-to-find expertise in analog design, analog process technology, packaging and manufacturing, will enhance our capabilities. Finally, National's 3 factories have lots of room for growth, which means we can focus our energies on customers and on driving growth from this portfolio instead of the unproductive task of moving products between factories that creates a lot of overhead expense and customer disruption.
We have included a supplemental chart on our website that details how much the acquisition contributed to our financial results. We closed the acquisition on September 23 and therefore, had 7 days of its results consolidated into TI's and our Analog segment's third quarter. The revenue contribution over this 7-day period was $18 million, and there was $2 million of associated operating profit consolidated into our Analog segment under the organizational name, Silicon Valley Analog. Silicon Valley Analog, or SVA as we abbreviate it, is now a fourth component of our Analog segment, along with High Performance Analog, Power Management and High Volume Analog & Logic. Of course, the $2 million of operating profit does not include acquisition-related charges, which are included in our Other segment. Kevin will review the acquisition-related charges and the impact of the acquisition on some of our balance sheet lines in a few minutes.
Our website also includes a chart that provides a historical perspective of the combined financials back to the beginning of 2010 and a chart that provides National's July to September results for 2011. We thought the latter would help you establish a baseline for our performance as we move into the fourth quarter as a combined operation. In future quarters, we will not break out details of our Silicon Valley Analog performance separately from the Analog segment's financial results.
So let's shift to the details of our third quarter results. Revenue declined 7% from a year ago and was flat sequentially. Revenue from our core product lines declined 3% from a year ago and declined 4% sequentially. The reason core products underperformed TI revenue overall in the sequential comparison was due to a rebound in DLP revenue, which is in the Other segment, as shipments from our Miho factory resumed in the third quarter following the shutdown after the Japan earthquake. Also, baseband revenue grew following our customer's inventory reduction in the first half of the year.
Analog revenue declined 2% from a year ago and 2% sequentially. The decline from a year ago was mostly driven by lower High Performance Analog revenue, while High Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management were each about even. Sequentially, both HPA and Power Management were lower while HVAL grew a few percent.
In Embedded Processing, revenue declined 7% from a year ago and 10% sequentially. Catalog products were the reason for the decline from a year ago, while Communications Infrastructure products were about even and automotive products grew double digits. In the sequential comparison, most of the decline also came from catalog products, although Communications Infrastructure products were down double digits and Automotive products were down a few points.
In our Wireless segment, revenue reduced 24% from a year ago and grew 4% sequentially. Baseband products were the biggest factor in both comparisons. Baseband revenue of $263 million in the third quarter fell 40% from a year ago and grew 16% from the prior quarter. Outside of Baseband products, revenue from OMAP applications processors grew, and revenue from connectivity products declined in both comparisons. Our OMAP revenue should continue to benefit in the quarters ahead as our latest customer programs continue to ramp into production.
Recently announced programs that are based on our OMAP 4 platform include: Samsung's Nexus smartphone, which will be our first OMAP production program based on Google's Ice Cream Sandwich reference platform; also, Samsung's Galaxy SII smartphone; Motorola's Droid Bionic and Droid RAZR smartphones; LG's Thrill smartphone, which is the first to feature 3D playback and capture; and the recently announced Amazon Fire tablet. A great lineup of customer products with more to come.
Revenue from our Other segment fell 3% from a year ago, due mostly to the sale of our cable modem product line in the fourth quarter of 2010, as well as declines across most product areas. Sequentially, revenue in this segment grew 10%, mostly due to higher shipments of DLP products, as noted earlier, as well as from earthquake-related insurance proceeds.
Turning to distribution, sales out of our distribution channel declined a couple of percentage points compared with the prior quarter. Despite falling resales, distributors reduced inventory levels even faster, resulting in the reduction of a day of inventory.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by walking through some of the acquisition-related costs. We will continue to report our results on a GAAP basis. However, we will make clear for you our costs associated with the acquisition, both in the near term, as well as on an ongoing basis. We have broken out a line on our income statement called acquisition costs, where most of these charges have been consolidated. This includes items such as restructuring costs, transaction costs, retention bonuses and amortization of intangibles.
In the third quarter, we had $147 million of acquisition costs. An important consideration for the next quarter is how inventory is recognized under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Inventory that we initially receive from National must be valued at fair value. Fair value generally means selling prices. Therefore, included in cost of revenue is the expensing of the write-up of this inventory to fair value. Although we are unable to consolidate this into the acquisition cost line, we will identify for you how much this cost impacts cost of revenue.  In the third quarter, it was $7 million due to the limited amount of time the Silicon Valley Analog was part of TI. It will be much more significant in the fourth quarter when we'll have a full quarter of shipments. The near-term impact is that sales of this inventory will effectively occur with little to no gross profit. This should continue to be an issue only for the fourth quarter, but we will fully expense the remaining write-up amount.
All of the cost of the inventory write-up will be carried in our Other segment. Our Analog segment will carry the cost of this inventory at normal standard costs, which generally reflects the cost of production. Our intent is for you to be able to easily see the ongoing performance of TI plus National in our Analog segment. So instead of carrying the acquisition-related costs in Analog, we will carry it in our Other segment.
Let me provide a summary of the $154 million in acquisition-related costs for the third quarter. They include $147 million of acquisition costs as identified on the income statement, plus $7 million of inventory write-up to fair value that is included in cost of revenue. Additionally, there was a negative $10 million discrete tax impact. All of this sums to $0.09 per share of costs associated with the acquisition.
Gross profit was essentially unchanged compared with the second quarter. Factory underutilization expense was higher as we lowered our production in response to weaker demand. To a lesser extent and not atypical for a downturn, we scrapped some inventory of custom products in response to certain customer program cancellations. This was partially offset by a positive net contribution associated with the earthquake.
Operating expenses of $783 million include $13 million associated with the Silicon Valley Analog. Even so, operating expenses were reduced 6% sequentially or $52 million, primarily due to reductions in the variable components of our compensation plan in response to the weaker environment.
As we discussed at our mid-quarter update, we have adjusted down our estimate for TI's annual effective tax rate for 2011 to 25% due to lower expected taxable income. The third quarter included catch-up adjustments for taxes since we had accrued at a higher rate than the first half of the year, partially offset by the $10 million tax discrete acquisition-related charge I mentioned earlier.
Net income in the third quarter was $601 million or $0.51 per share. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the third quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $10 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have reported.
Given the additional complexity of this quarter, it might be helpful if I walk through various ins and outs of the transition from the $0.56 of earnings per share that we reported in the second quarter to the $0.51 reported for the third quarter. First, we had $0.08 per share of higher costs associated with the acquisition. That's $0.09 in the third quarter compared with $0.01 in the second quarter. In addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by about $0.05 associated with miscellaneous items, including the lower utilization levels, inventory scrap and product mix.
We also had $0.02 of negative impact in Other income expense, mostly related to litigation associated with the divested business. And we had an additional $0.01 of interest expense this quarter. On the positive side, we saw a net $0.04 beneficial transition associated with the earthquake and our insurance proceeds for that event. We also benefited by $0.03 from operating expense reductions. Our lower tax rate, including the associated catch-up adjustments, provided a $0.03 benefit. Finally, our lower share count contributed $0.01.
I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. The company ended the quarter with $2.62 billion in cash. During the quarter, we issued $1.2 billion in commercial paper, which remains outstanding. Cash flow from operations was $1.14 billion. This was up $511 million from last quarter, mostly reflecting the payment of income taxes in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $193 million in the quarter, down from $276 million in the prior quarter. We used $450 million in the quarter to repurchase 14.1 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $148 million.
We increased our inventory by $203 million in the quarter. The increase was due to $215 million of inventory that came to us as a result of the acquisition. Please remember that this amount includes the effect of the write-up of the National inventory at fair value. A calculation of days of inventory yields 103 days. However, I would caution you that this is a misleading number. Not only does it include the write-up of National inventory to fair value, it also includes the entire inventory received in the acquisition even though the revenue or cost of revenue included is only for the 7 days that, that business was operating as part of TI. It is probably more meaningful to back out the inventory and cost of revenue associated with the acquisition completely. With that, our days of inventory on an apples-to-apples basis declined from 93 days at the end of the second quarter to 92 days at the end of the third quarter.
Receivables and days sales outstanding should similarly be adjusted for the acquisition, with the net effect being that DSOs of 46 days would be 43 days after the adjustment. Orders of $3.07 billion in the quarter were down 15% sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 0.89 in the quarter compared with 1.04 in the second quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.26 billion to $3.54 billion in the fourth quarter or down 6% to up 2% sequentially. As a reminder, this includes a full quarter of SVA revenue compared with a record -- to the third quarter that included only 7 days. Also, please remember that the fourth quarter is when we typically see about a $100 million sequential decline in calculator revenue following the back-to-school period.
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.36. EPS will be negatively impacted by about $0.15 associated with the acquisition-related cost in the fourth quarter. This will include about $160 million of acquisition costs and additionally, about $100 million included in the cost of revenue. Also, note that the fourth quarter will include a full quarter of operating expense associated with the acquisition compared with 7 days in the third quarter. Operating expenses will also reflect the non-recurrence of catch-up adjustments to our compensation. Together, these items will result in operating expenses increasing by $160 million to $170 million.
Again, in consideration of the additional complexity, let me walk through our EPS transition from the $0.51 we reported in the third quarter to the $0.32 that is at the middle of our fourth quarter range. First, acquisition-related charges of $0.15 in the fourth quarter will be about $0.06 more than we had in the third quarter. Lower revenue in the fourth quarter will impact EPS by $0.02. Lower factory utilization will impact us by about $0.01. As I mentioned previously, we will have a full quarter of SVA operating expense, which will impact us by about $0.07. Outside of the acquisition, operating expenses will go up by about $0.01 due to the non-recurrence of the third quarter catch-up adjustments to our variable compensation expense. Finally, we will see about $0.02 of negative impact from taxes in the fourth quarter. This tax impact is due to the third quarter, including the catch-up adjustment that we do not expect to recur in the fourth quarter.
Our estimate for 2011 R&D, capital expenditures and depreciation are unchanged. It might be useful for me to provide some insight into our expectations for acquisition-related charges as we go forward. As a first estimate, after $260 million in the fourth quarter, we will be complete with the impact from the inventory write-up adjustment. As a result, we expect first quarter 2012 acquisition-related cost to decline to about $150 million, dropping to about $110 million in the second quarter. After that, these charges should decline about $10 million per quarter until we reach $80 million, which is the amortization of intangibles amount. This will continue for 8 to 10 years. We will update you on our expectations as we move forward, and we will continue to make these charges available -- visible for you as we report.
In summary, the market environment continues to be difficult, yet we believe we have already seen early signs of stabilization. With our acquisition of National Semiconductor, we are taking a big strategic step that will strengthen both our market position and our ability to serve our customers. The integration task that is ahead of us will be a multiyear effort and will be challenging. We recognize this and are up for the job. In the end, we are confident that we will deliver attractive and growing returns on this acquisition investment for many years to come.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
And I realize that we threw a lot of data at you in our prepared remarks. We do have a copy of these prepared remarks already posted on our website for your convenience. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?

We will go first to John Pitzer of Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Quickly guys, on the core percent of revenue being down about 7% sequentially in December, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color of how that might play out between analog, wireless and embedded?
Ron Slaymaker
John, I'm not sure that we -- that the core number -- I don't believe we broke out for the December quarter. I think what you heard us say was what core did for the third quarter. So I don't have a separate forecast for you going forward into the December quarter other than the consolidated forecast that we typically provide. Do you have a follow on?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Well, I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of the operating revenue incentive being Analog versus maybe the Baseband business, OMAP and connectivity. Is there any color you can give around the sequential expected growth relative to guidance for the December quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Again, John, that's -- typically, what we tend to provide in guidance is the total revenue number. I think this quarter we -- well, probably what you were thinking about when you said core revenue was when we told you the difference that semis, what semis which we're in versus the total revenue because of the impact of calculators. But I don't have a more detailed breakout across wireless, analog or Embedded Processing. Do you have a follow on?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. Then quickly, just on the utilization front, do you think the December quarter is kind of at the bottom in utilization? And at what level are you bottoming here?
Ron Slaymaker
Kevin?
Kevin P. March
John, we do expect utilization to decline further in the fourth quarter from the third, just like third declining from the second. We don't have a forecast as to whether or not it declines further in first quarter. That's going to be more of a reflection of our outlook as to what the first and especially second quarter revenues might look like as it takes further lead time to build the material. So again, we do expect utilization to drop a few more points in the fourth quarter from the third, but we don't have a forecast beyond that.
Ron Slaymaker
But John, I think we even tried to explain back at mid-quarter that this is mostly a macro-driven downturn. Now any time customers reset their production levels, typically they'll also reset or rationalize their inventory levels to that new level of production. So what we have seen and what we believe we've seen is that the customers' own inventory reset is largely behind us. And at this point, our customers' production and therefore, our own shipments will track with basically in demand, which is more macro economically driven. So once we -- I think we have a reasonable view of fourth quarter, but once we go beyond that, it really ties to what the macro economy does and which way that tends to take in demand for our customers' product and therefore, how that would drive around. Okay, John.
Operator
We will go next to Glen Yeung of Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Do you guys have a sense as to whether or not you're actually under-shipping distributors sell-through, I suppose you would call it in Q4. And actually, in Q3, can you just give us a sense as to the relative softness between OEMs and disti?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So Glen, in terms of Q3, basically we had sales out of our distribution channel down a couple of points, couple of percentage points compared with the third quarter. Yet against that, they were able to reduce their inventory levels, so I think you would translate that to say our shipments in were below their shipments out. Therefore, they were able to reduce the levels of their TI inventory. I'm sorry, you had another part of that question?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes, which is, how does the OEM business compare relative to distribution business?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. And again, we have less visibility into OEM other than where we have consignment programs, which is significant. That's probably -- OEM consignment programs probably represents 25% of our total revenue. And so we have good visibility there and absolutely we own the inventory. We keep it lean. We keep it high turning. For the -- about a 35% or so of our revenue that tends to be operated on traditional backlog and order entry systems, we have less visibility. That's really where I would say previously, our view of what we've seen. And we actually saw that in our revenue trends in the quarter is that customers because of the economic uncertainty, basically reset their own inventory, desired inventory levels. They accomplish that reset earlier in the first half of this quarter and then, we've seen revenue pick up somewhat as that inventory completion -- inventory reset has been completed. That's not saying they're off and running by any means in terms of their own production levels but their inventory reset of TI components, we think, is largely completed at this point. Do you have a follow-on, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Yes, I do. I couldn't help but notice in the list of phones that you gave with OMAP 4 that a lot of those sounded like they were phones someone else had in the Honeycomb generation of Android. And it sort of raises the question of stickiness of op processors, as we change generations of operating systems. So I wonder, if you can give us a sense of that, how sticky do you think OMAP 4 will be in Ice Cream Sandwich and then more importantly, how sticky do you think it will be in the next generation of Google operating system?
Kevin P. March
Glen, I don't want to imply any -- how would I say it? That we take any of these programs for granted. We have to win our business, and re-win our business everyday. But I would say the same time, for a lot of these customers, TI has been a long-term supplier of many products into their handsets. My own view, as I think Honeycomb was a bit of an anomaly especially on the tablet side because there was a race by many OEMs to have some type of demonstration product available at last year's Consumer Electronics show, and that drove at least what I would say was very visible as when from maybe another supplier. And as I would have described even back in last January, a lot of those same OEMs that were demonstrating platform space on another supplier at Consumer Electronics Show, we had active development programs underway at that same point in time with OMAP. So I think the difference is we are a supplier that they've had a history with. They're comfortable. They know we can support both their business terms, as well as the kind of volume production requirements that operationally these high-volume handsets require. So I think we're pretty confident in our position with these various players. But at that same time, we -- I think have proven over the years our ability to do a good job and re-winning that business every day that we're engaged with these customers.
Operator
And we will go next to Craig Ellis of Caris & Company.
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
Ron, you had mentioned you're seeing some signs of a cyclical bottoming and you mentioned a slowing in order deceleration activity in August and September. Are there other things that you're seeing out there that lend conviction that we are getting close to a bottom?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I think just the fact I tried to identify 3 things: one was the order trends; the second one was that just in general, lead times are short, which in and of itself is not indicative of a bottom but usually exists at the bottom of the cycle; and then finally, just the fact that -- I'm going blank on my third one. Kevin, do you remember what it was?
Kevin P. March
We saw revenue profile shift to the third.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, there was a third, another one that I mentioned. But anyway, those were -- I'll find it here shortly. Just as I said before, inventories are lean, both at OEMs and distributors. And so again, we don't have additional depletion of inventory that needs to take place for growth to start to recover. So -- and again, that doesn't mean we're at a bottom because, again, we will be -- revenue will go down in the fourth quarter, especially if you compare on an apples-to-apples basis. But one thing I'll also note is that if you look at the delta to just seasonal, third quarter, we are about 7 points below our seasonal norm. And fourth quarter, if you take the middle of our range, we would also be about 7 points below the seasonal average. So one way of looking at that is that at least we're not to the extent we accomplish that midrange point in revenue for fourth quarter. We're kind of maybe caught bumping on the bottom as opposed to operating in an environment that is getting progressively worse. So we'll see how it lands, but that's our perspective. Do you have a follow-on, Craig?
Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division
Yes. I think TI has historically had a strong notebook peripheral power management position. So given all the flooding issues in Thailand, is there anything that TI is picking up that would leave you uncomfortable with build activity in the fourth quarter for that business?
Ron Slaymaker
Crag, I'm a little uncomfortable getting too far out of on the edge there because there certainly is a lot of uncertainty so -- and that's a rapidly changing situation, but I can walk you through some considerations. First is that TI does not have any facilities there. That being said, we do have some assembly test subcontractors, as well as a few components, select suppliers, for example. Some very specific lead time -- our lead frame suppliers. We do have some products that as a result are impacted. And to the best, we've been able to gauge our current assessment is that it would impact potentially about 1% of our revenue in the fourth quarter. We're working with the customers that are impacted, working with them on contingency plans. We're going to work through that. So this does not include any impact to the customers themselves, either customers that are operating in Thailand or customers that might have their own production plans changed because they're unable to get supply from other suppliers to have a more direct Thailand impact. So we're trying to work through all that. Just a note, we do have programs where customers -- and these are programs where maybe there are some second sourcing type of arrangements on high-volume programs, such as hard disk drives, where customers have contacted us, requesting us to pick up additional support for products that their other sourced semiconductor supplier might have been more impacted by Thailand from an assembly test perspective. And they're asking us for upside support. So again, we're working through all that. The best we can say, at least as it directly affects our production, is very minimal impact but we're still working with the customers to understand their end of it as well.
Operator
And we will go next to Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Thanks for the transparency around National, that's very helpful. I'm trying to compare your Q4 guidance with the Q3 results. So if you exclude the onetime charges, we get $0.60 in pro forma EPS for Q3. And if we do the same for Q4, we get $0.47. So apples-to-apples, excluding charges, EPS is down over 20%. But you're guiding sale is down only I think 2% or so. So what's driving the much larger decline in pro forma EPS?
Kevin P. March
So among the things that we talked about sequentially, you got, as you point out, lower revenue. That's probably about $0.02 worth of the delta there. We're also expecting lower utilization. That's about $0.01 of the delta. We're expecting -- I mentioned to -- during my prepared remarks that the reduction in OpEx that we saw in the third quarter was due to some catchup adjustments for accruals on variable compensation. Those will not recur in the fourth quarter, and so that will cause our TI OpEx, if you want to go up by about $0.01. We also had a benefit in the third quarter from a lower tax rate from a catchup adjustment that was similar in the fourth quarter will be on a -- we don't expect a recurrence of that. That's about $0.02. And then finally, we'll have a full quarter's worth of National Semi's OpEx in our numbers and that's about $0.07 in transition. So when you run the math, that's how you get to the $0.47.
Ron Slaymaker
And again, that's from the $0.60 to the $0.47 in both cases where acquisition costs are excluded. Is that right, Kevin?
Kevin P. March
Correct.
Ron Slaymaker
And just, Vivek, to make sure I emphasize, when Kevin talked about the return of TI OpEx that had been reduced in third quarter, third quarter reduction in OpEx included 2 components basically. One was ongoing reduction, and then the second component basically was the catchup for the fact that we had been accruing compensation expense at a higher rate during the first half of the year. So the ongoing reduction will continue into the fourth quarter. It's just the catchup amount that doesn't recur that results in some sequential increase in fourth quarter and a very similar story on the tax reduction in fourth quarter and a slight increase then in third quarter -- I'm sorry, the fourth quarter. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes, just one quick one. Your buyback appears to be holding up quite well. How do you look at that as we go through this softer macro period? Are you allocating a certain percentage or free cash flow to it or how are you strategically looking at buyback activity?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Vivek, there's a number of different elements to go into it. But as we had indicated when we announced the acquisition of National, we would moderate the amount that we spent on buybacks versus what you've seen us in prior periods, largely in preparation for beginning to set aside cash reserves to begin to repay debt as it comes due. For example, National Semiconductor debt that we acquired includes $375 million that's going to be due on June 15 of next year. So we'll need to set some cash aside through payback. And further going into 2013, of course, we'll have some of our own debt that we issued for the acquisition coming due and we'll begin to build cash for that. But all that being said, we did announce last month that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our dividend by about 30%, from $0.13 per share to $0.17 per share. That's effective this quarter. So that is part of how we're returning cash to our investors. And we'll continue to return cash in the form of buybacks albeit at a more moderate rate over the foreseeable future, as we shift to accumulate some cash for some of the maturity of the debt when it comes due.
Operator
And we will go next to Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
First question would be just on margins and what are going to be the big drivers of the margin delta from quarter-to-quarter over the next several quarters? I understand your comments about fab utilization driving about $0.01 of the margin or utilization is driving $0.01 of the EPS decline in the fourth quarter. But what's going to be the most important going forward, mix versus fab utilization versus -- even for the next quarter, some of the expansion issues on the National inventory?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Jim, I think the biggest driver next quarter is going to be the market fair value of the inventory that we acquire from National Semiconductor. There's a -- basically, there's going to be almost $100 million worth of additional cost in cost to revenue that would normally not be there. And I think if you do the math on that, that probably falls through on an after-tax basis of somewhere around $0.055 to $0.06. So clearly, that's weighing us down until we get through that fair value kind of adjustment. As you already pointed out, we've also got lower utilization that will be weighing us down. Once the utilization and certainly once the fair value adjustment is behind us, we'll get a little bit of a lift just because that won't be recurring. In addition, as we begin to see the bottoming out that Ron mentioned and, ideally, the resumption of end demand on a more-than-growth vector, utilization starts being a benefit for us. But most importantly, on the longer term is with the acquisition of the National Semiconductor, Analog now amounts to almost half of our total revenue, from somewhere around the low 40% to 43%, 44% earlier in the year. So on a go-forward basis, 1/3 of that mix will help us. I'll remind folks on the phone that National's overall gross margins actually were higher than TI's prior to acquisition. So that alone will -- should help up the mix a little bit. But more importantly, the total mix of Analog revenue would become a bigger portion of TI's revenue as we go forward. And that alone will help us as we march on our long-term goal to 65% gross margins for the company.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, great. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, kind of a follow-up, one A and B. I'll let you guys decide if you want to answer both or one. The first would be, I'm assuming that the expensing of the inventory is just a one quarter issue and you're going to get all that back then in the first quarter margins as we think about. And the second thing is, with the increase in margins you get from National as you referenced, is there any updates or when might we hear an update to the long-term margin model of the company?
Kevin P. March
What would you like? I think I want to take one A or one B, so maybe I'll just give you both. On the expensing, you are correct. That is a one quarter issue by our estimate. That should be essentially complete when we -- through the fourth quarter and should have that behind us as we enter the first quarter. As to increase in -- or just in the model for the company, we want to be able to consistently deliver up to 55% before we go off and start looking at a new model for the company. So we'll hold to the models that we've had for several years now, which is 55% gross and 30% operating is really what we're trying to design the company to operate at.
Operator
We will go next to Uche Orji of UBS.
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Ron, can I just ask you real quick on connectivity and the Wireless business. So we have seen OMAP grew, baseband grew, but connectivity was down. Can you just talk about 2 things, one is what's causing that shift in connectivity vis-à-vis the rest? And also, how much more resilience shall we expect in the baseband business?
Ron Slaymaker
Could you -- how much more -- what was your last...
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Yes, what is the outlook for the baseband business? Should we still contribute more of that to go down?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, okay. Connectivity is pretty straightforward. It will be a little bit awkward of a response for what will become obvious reasons, but our 2 largest connectivity customers currently are not doing as well in the marketplace as some of their peers. And as a result, TI's connectivity revenue has not held up as well as some of our other, as for example, the OMAP revenue. And keep in mind, there's also mix even within the customers. So for example, our connectivity product line tends to be very -- it tends to be centric around WiFi and combos that use WiFi or centered up on WiFi, and so again that tends to be the very highest end of the customers' product range. And while smartphones are doing well, overall, the mix within some of our customers has been stronger at the lower end where we don't supply connectivity versus the higher end where we are engaged. Okay? And then the outlook for baseband going forward is unchanged. And again, what we've seen this quarter is the kind of noise that we have told you to expect in baseband where during the first half of the year, we had some inventory reduction taking place at our customer. This quarter represents a bit of a snapback from that. So we've moved above, we call that, historical or the linear trend line. But the best guidance we can give you going forward is draw a straight line between third quarter of this year and first quarter of 2013 being zero. And that's a rough approximation of how we expect that revenue to trend. So again, we expect that it will be completed essentially by the end of 2012. And I don't know if that was one or 2 questions, Uche, but do you have a follow-on?
Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Separately, can I just ask you about moving sort of the parts in the fourth quarter guidance so, obviously, x the contribution from National Semi? Are there very specific end markets where we didn't want to describe as bottoming process? Are there specific end markets where we are seeing stronger or weaker, as we look at Q4?
Ron Slaymaker
Uche, I think somebody else had taken a run at that and we -- as you're aware, we don't break out our revenue forecast by various end markets. I'm sure you'll have -- we'll have certain areas better than others, but we were not forecasting that. But again, keep in mind, the pressure that we're feeling on demand is economically driven. I'd say, maybe more so on the consumer side than on the enterprise side, but it's economically driven, which tends to weigh pretty much across the board. Just as in third quarter, things generally across the board were well below seasonal. We had the same kind of expectation going in the fourth quarter.
Operator
And we will go next to Shawn Webster of Macquarie.
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
I was -- my first question is on the supply chain and inventories. Are there areas from your perspective that still seem lean? And on the other side, are there areas which seem like they need to digest in inventory?
Kevin P. March
Well, Shawn, I think, as Ron mentioned earlier, just as we look at certain supply tests we see where inventories are at, our distribution inventories, as Ron mentioned, were down about a day, still holding there at about 6 weeks. Our consigned inventories and our consignment customers continue to be very lean by definition because they pull only as they consume. That represents about 2/3 of channel that we can see. The other 1/3, which is more classic direct sales to OEMs, we don't really have great visibility there but we also don't have a lot of concern there, given that, broadly speaking, we actually came out of third quarter a little bit higher than we expected versus the mid-quarter update. And that was from a variety of customers actually material a little bit more than we expected in the quarter. So that -- those signals all tell us that the inventory is probably at pretty good shape across the entire -- our customer base and where we supply at.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Shawn?
Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research
Yes, I do. So on -- in terms of other income, is there any guidance there? And then also, can you update us on the capacity of your 300-millimeter and expansion plans?
Kevin P. March
On the other income, Shawn, I think that the main thing that you saw in the second quarter -- third quarter, excuse me, was interest expense of about $15 million. That was an all-in quarter for the debt that TI now holds and will hold for a couple of years. Fourth quarter will be a little bit higher. It will be about $22 million, and that will be adding in the debt that we assumed with the acquisition of National Semiconductor. So that's probably the main change I'd point you to on the other income and expense. As to the Miho fab, we have, as you know, been ramping that factory for some time now, especially step up the ramp pace when the earthquake happened in Miho as Miho holds a lot of products. We continue to ramp product into that factory. The total capacity for what we've purchased equipment forward would generate about -- when it's all loaded, as we indicated, up to $2 billion worth of revenue out of that factory. We're considerably below that today as we continue to ramp.
Ron Slaymaker
In fact, I think our current levels were running about 20% of that capacity level. The other point I need to make is the $2 billion that Kevin references is equipment that we have purchased and in-house today, which, as you're aware, Shawn, only represents about half of the floor space inside of that fab. So we have lots of room for expansion, but we also have plenty of equipment already on the floor that we're ramping into. So again, 20%, lots of room to grow just even within the equipment we purchased, but lots of floor space beyond that.
Operator
And we will go next to C.J. Muse of Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I guess, first question, in terms of your comments on seeing stabilization, I was curious if you're seeing that across the board or specific to any certain end markets?
Kevin P. March
C.J., I guess we'd say that the size of stabilization were more a question of if we're seeing a bottoming process beginning to fall and not so much stabilizing, as evidenced by the fact that we still expect our revenues to be down next quarter. So again, it's more important just to note that what we were seeing through our order patterns, through our lead times and through overall inventories, that we'll begin to see the bottom of this demand decline begin to shape or form a bottom, although it's not there yet because, again, we expect fourth quarter just to go on.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, C.J., do you have a follow-on?
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Yes, as a quick follow-up, just to revisit gross margins. If I look at the OpEx guiding in that $22 million other income -- or other expense, rather, it looks like you're guiding gross margins roughly flat. And so I guess, a, is that correct? And then, b, once we get through selling of the inventory without margins, should we be thinking, we get immediately back up to another 100, 150 bps higher on the gross margin side even without a pickup in utilization? How should we think about that?
Kevin P. March
C.J., I'm not really sure how you're building your gross margin assumption in your model. I would point out that there is about $100 million in cost to revenue in the fourth quarter that will depress our gross margins on a GAAP basis quarter-over-quarter. In addition, we expect lower utilizations would be another more pressure on gross margin from that standpoint. If you're extracting that $100 million, then maybe that's where you're getting your gross margins to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. So I'm not really sure what your assumption is there, but I would want to point out those 2 items I just mentioned.
Ron Slaymaker
Right. So $100 million, C.J., as you probably alluded already, will be about -- or 300 basis points approximately pressure in the fourth quarter. That will be completely gone in the first quarter. So there may be other things that come about in first quarter, of course. But that inventory, the expensing of the inventory write up is a fourth quarter effect only and then, it will be cleaned out by the time we get into first quarter.
Operator
We'll go next to Chris Danely of J.P. Morgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
On the National acquisition, I think you threw out a target of $100 million in cost savings. Do you still feel confident in that target and anything that's surprised you on the upside or the downside with the acquisition so far in the integration?
Kevin P. March
Chris, on the $100 million cost savings, that -- we still hold to that forecast. And just to remind the other listeners on the phone, what we were talking about there is that by the end of the first year after acquisitions, so that will probably be in the fourth quarter of next year, we'd expect to have enough of the redundant cost removed, that we would see about $100 million of annualized cost savings or about $25 million a quarter starting about a year from now. And we still expect that to be a reasonable forecast for planning purposes. As to any surprises on the upside or downside, I'd say it's probably just a little too early for us to really find any of those yet. We've been pretty focused here on -- Gregg and the management team getting out and visiting with customers on the world tour, and focused on updating our online systems and our marketing material to be able to make this a seamless appearance to our customers and that there's one place to go that has all 42,000-plus analog parts in it. And we've also been focusing on the beginning steps of the overall integration of our systems and methodology. So not enough time yet to really have pluses or minus beyond that we can talk about.
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, I will add that we -- I mean, of course, this acquisition is hugely important to TI. And as a result, we understand it's also really important to our investors. So you will see ongoing progress updates and lots of details from TI in terms of our progress there. So stay tuned, you'll see them as we get them. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes, I guess, one more, a more broad-based question on National. So now you've had a chance to at least take a look at it, peek under the covers, kimono or whatever you want to call it, what do you guys think are the 2 or 3 keys to sort of turning around the share loss there? And what sort of landmarks can we look at? Is there any sort of time frame there?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, Kevin, what did you find as you looked under the hood?
Kevin P. March
Well, I think probably the encouraging thing that we found early on is certainly from Gregg's tour with his managers. The reception that we've gotten from those in our distribution channel, and importantly from our customers, has been extremely encouraging. The sound bite that I keep gravitating to or hearing, if you will, is that customers really, really like National's parts. And we're glad that they can now comfortably and safely design them back in to their future products. We actually find that very encouraging. Beyond that, we clearly have some challenges in front of us also, which is making sure that we are able to integrate the companies from an overall process standpoint to be sure that our systems integrate properly and we don't wind up the blind spots and holes and so on, which are always challenges when you make an integration of this size.
Ron Slaymaker
And Chris, I think it's been pretty exciting for some of the National management that have been out on this world tour as well because what they -- I mean, they're finding a reception as part of TI that they haven't been used to for a while. And so I think there is a refreshing upside that they're seeing that makes them pretty excited to be part of TI as well.
Operator
We will go next to Romit Shah of  Nomura.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Ron, just want to confirm that my math is correct. National add about the $300 million to revenue in Q4 and it will be about -- I guess, excluding acquisition charges, about $0.02 dilutive to EPS. Am I in the ballpark?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, Kevin is thinking about the EPS. I can confirm you're in the ballpark, the $300 million of Q4 revenue.
Kevin P. March
Yes. And Romit, it will add some to EPS on a pro-forma basis. But we need to be careful on a GAAP basis because -- in fact, we will have an increased acquisition-related charge that I mentioned, $160 million of acquisition cost plus $100 million of the fair value markup of their inventory that will go to cost to goods sold.
Ron Slaymaker
Right. So the amount that goes through, that will be reported as part of our Analog segment, which is more of the ongoing operations will be profitable. You're probably not too far off in terms of your estimate there, Romit. But again, that's exclusive of all acquisition-related charges. Okay, do you have a follow-on, Romit?
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Yes. I saw that you reiterated your CapEx guidance for the year. Can you just share with us your thoughts about that going forward into 2012 and how you're managing headcount in this environment?
Kevin P. March
Yes, Romit, the CapEx, we haven't given a 2012 forecast just yet. But I would remind you that we did take advantage of the downturn and acquired substantial capacity, especially in the more expensive wafer fab side of the CapEx build during the last 18 months or so, which implicitly means that our need to spend money on that portion of capital should be lower than normal for the next couple of years. Beyond that, we'll continue to spend, of course, on our -- some of the test operations. Our model is 5% to 8% under the CapEx spend. And the fact, if you take a look over the last 12 months, we've actually spent about 7% of revenue on CapEx, with depreciation running at about 6.5% of revenue. So consistent with where we've been, I'd expect those kind of factors to apply going forward. As to staffing, we do continue to hire people, certainly, on a selective basis in the areas where we expect to grow, and those would be in Analog and Embedded Processing, as well as in field app engineers and talented salespeople.
Ron Slaymaker
And just that don't remember -- please remember, we just hired over 5,000 new TI employees.
Operator
That will come from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
One clarification really quickly, the $0.47 midpoint of the pro forma guide, that excludes that inventory writeup on the National side. So if we x that out off the fourth quarter, you don't have to worry about it in the first quarter reversing itself, is that correct?
Kevin P. March
Correct.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And then I guess a bigger picture question, what's your assumption for just the inventory levels in the fourth quarter? Is your guidance assuming that the inventory gets burned further, stays the same, rises, et cetera?
Ron Slaymaker
Ross, we don't intend to provide a lot of breakout there. But let me just say, TI's distribution inventory is very consistent with where it has been historically. So I don't anticipate that you're going to see a big change there. And again, that's at -- I think we're just over 6 weeks at the current level. And again, we went down a day even in the third quarter. The one thing I would say is that with National, there's just adjustments going on with distribution in general there. So there can be some slight realignment. I think they finished third quarter or what we had in the channel there when we completed the third quarter was about 10 weeks of inventory. And historically, they tend to run, I think, 9 to 10 weeks. And then you'll see, over time, further adjustments there as we implement consignment programs with distribution and those types of value-add programs. But again, that will be over the course of time and literally, that will be years as we implement that. Did you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, just really quick, the $100 million in synergies that you guys plan on with National. Any shot at how much of that comes on the OpEx lines rather than the COGS line?
Kevin P. March
Virtually, all of it will come on OpEx, Ross.
Ron Slaymaker
To all of you, thanks for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2011 Mid-Quarter Update Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining TI's mid-quarter financial update for the third quarter of 2011. In a moment, I will provide a short summary of TI's current expectations for the quarter, updating the revenue and EPS estimate ranges for the company. In general, I will not provide detailed information on revenue trends by segment or end markets and I will not address details of profit margins.  In our earnings release at the end of the quarter, we will provide this information. 
As usual with our mid-quarter update, we will not be taking follow-up calls this evening. Considering the limited information available at this point in the quarter and in consideration of everyone's time, we will limit this call to 30 minutes. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the news release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. 
We have narrowed and lowered our expected ranges for TI's revenue and earnings from our previous ranges. We now expect TI revenue between $3.23 billion and $3.37 billion. We expect earnings per share between $0.56 and $0.60. The reductions are due to broadly lower demands across a wide range of products, markets and customers. 
Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question, please limit yourself to a single question. I will provide you the opportunity to ask a follow-up question. Operator?

Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
I know you mentioned in the preamble you weren't going to talk about operating margins or profitably, but I'm just kind of  curious, the EPS line is holding up much better than the revenue on the new guidance. I'm kind of curious if you could walk me kind of through the puts and takes of what's driving that. How quickly are you guys able to react on OpEx relative to the current environment versus what might be going on in the mix of revenue?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, John, there's really 2 reasons behind why you didn't see a more, call it, proportionate drop between EPS and revenue. The first is that we are reducing variable expenses really on multiple fronts just in light of the weaker environment that we're currently in. So for example, our compensation includes variable components such as bonus and profit sharing that we've now revised downward. The second consideration is that with our lower profit outlook we've revised our annual effective tax rate estimate down to about 25% from our prior estimate of 27%. And as you're aware since we have been accruing both of those items at higher rates during the first half of the year, we will also then have a catch-up in the accounting, a catch-up benefit in the third quarter. So that really explains the difference between what you might have expected for EPS to go to versus what we're projecting here. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
Yes. Ron, you talked a little about the variable cost that you can go after, just on the fixed cost side, anything happening to CapEx and/or headcount?
Ron Slaymaker
No. In terms of CapEx, no change to our guidance on that. And in terms of headcount, I would -- I'll actually change that somewhat to hiring. I mean we're actually still hiring for strategic programs. Hiring has become much more selective, you might say, in this environment. And we're certainly keeping our resources focused on what we believe are the best opportunities that we're addressing, but the hiring has become more selective. But outside of that, no real headcount swings other than what might come about from attrition. We'll move to the next caller, please?
Operator
And we'll go next to, Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Ron, could you talk a little bit about the distribution channel, what you're seeing there, especially as far as inventory level and lead times. I'm just trying to understand how they are sort of reacting to this lower demand environment?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I guess what I would say is that we expect resales from our distribution channel to decline at about the same rate as our overall revenue. So therefore, kind of mid-single-digit declines on sales out of the channel. We expect really little change in distribution inventory levels on an absolute basis. Although with the declining resales, they could be up somewhat on a days basis. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes, should we assume that by product lines, things are tracking the same too? I'm just trying to understand if maybe your Wireless business is tracking seasonally better than, let's say, Analog and Embedded Processing?
Ron Slaymaker
Not really, Tore. I guess, just in general, we're seeing broadly lower demand across our product lines and then as I said previously, customers as well as markets. So if you kind of walk through the segment, we would expect both Analog and Embedded Processing, which are both very diverse businesses, to decline sequentially. Wireless will likely be about even with the second quarter but also note that the third quarter is traditionally our Wireless segment's seasonally strongest quarter, so flat is really pretty weak for that for our third quarter. Within Wireless, I would note that our OMAP applications processor revenue, we expect will be up strongly compared with the second quarter, while connectivity revenue will be down due to customer bit mix. Baseband revenue will likely also be up. Finally, our other segment, really, we would expect it to be up mostly due to DLP revenue that will benefit from increased output from our factory in Miho, Japan. And you might recall that product line, and certainly that factory, was impacted by the earthquake and the subsequent shutdown there. And let's move to the next caller.
Operator
And we'll go next to Chris Danely with JP Morgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Ron, can you just maybe comment on TI's internal inventory and what the plans are for the utilization rate?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So from an inventory standpoint, I think, as you probably might assume, inventory and inventory days will both move up this quarter as we had planned operationally for a stronger demand environment than what is evidenced to us today. So that being said, we had already reduced production starts even coming out of second quarter, although there will be some lag time before that action would impact the inventory level. And I said even coming out of second quarter, you'll recall that in the second quarter, we said during the month of June is really when it started to become evident to us that we were seeing below seasonal forecast out of our computing and various consumer customers and that led to our guidance for our third quarter to be below seasonal. So again, during the month of June, we had already started to take action to lower utilization rate production starts. But again there's -- until that works through the system, there won't be an immediate impact on inventory. I'll also note the inventory that we had in place, for the most part are long-lived catalog products, where really there's practically no risk of obsolescence. Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Yes, just to follow up on your June commentary. Can you just talk about the linearity or trend of orders and bookings for this quarter and what it would mean for Q4?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, I don't know that I want to talk linearity but I will say that orders are weak and we expect that in total, third quarter orders will be down from the second quarter level. And we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Ron, in 2008, one of the things that we saw happen was the channel taking inventories below normal levels because of the panic associated with the financial crisis. And my question is to what extent do think what you're seeing now from your customers, the lower demand, is that driven by serious concerns about the market and people wanting to de-stock inventories and take them below normal? Or is this do you think a reflection of your customers just reacting right to the weaker demand environment?
Ron Slaymaker
I believe the latter. So we do not believe that what we're encountering would be a typical semiconductor inventory cycle. Macroeconomic weakness is resulting in broadly lower demand from both consumers and enterprises and as our customer's been or faced with lower demand for their product, of course, they rationalize their inventory levels. But the real root issue is demand, not too much inventory. And I think you'll recall, we described, in some detail, back in July, that we believe inventories were in pretty good shape both in our distribution channel as well as the high percentage of customers, OEM customers, where we have consignment programs. So again, we had reasonable visibility in inventory levels and they seemed fine. But of course, as people forecasted, customers forecasted, their demand goes down, then of course, they will rationalize inventory levels as well. Do you have a follow-on?
Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Yes. Some analog companies are seeing higher commodity prices impact their gross margins, is this impacting you guys?
Ron Slaymaker
I would say to some degree. I mean items like gold certainly are a factor in our cost and they've -- commodities in general have gone up, but I don't know that we will, now or certainly in October, either be able to quantify that specifically. We'll move to the next caller, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Ron, what do you get from the sense of your lead times versus your competitor lead times? The reason I ask, I'm trying to get sense of how much of the incremental revenue weakness you're talking about today is a function of the fact that if your lead times are a little longer than some others maybe this is just going to catch up from what others are seeing or if this is just an incremental let down for everybody?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, I don't know that we can answer that. I think our lead times, we would characterize, are at normal levels. And I would say that also includes Miho-source products where, you might recall, we described in July, that lead times had been extended for those products that were manufactured there given the supply constraint. But we've pretty much resolved those and have lead times back to normal levels. So, I don't know are we leading or lagging in terms of time versus what you're seeing from others? But we'll let you make that assessment. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
No that's good.
Ron Slaymaker
And next caller, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
Just wanted to think about the utilization you said you are bringing down is to try to control inventory. How does that flow through to the gross margin line? Do you period expense that or does it have to work its way through so the gross margin impact is actually delayed by a quarter or so?
Ron Slaymaker
No, the gross margin impact is felt immediately. So we expense -- essentially any cost impact associated with underutilization, we expense in the current period and all of our inventory is valued at standard cost. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
I do, a quick one, just for clarification. When you talked about the Wireless business performing roughly flat, did I hear right that both OMAP and Baseband would be up? And if so, does connectivity really have to go down a ton to offset those 2 rising?
Ron Slaymaker
You heard right that OMAP is up strongly, Baseband, we expect to be up and connectivity will offset growth in both of those areas, that's correct. And we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
We'll go next to Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
Would you expect gross margins to be up given the reduction in variable expenses?
Ron Slaymaker
Romit, we don't specifically break out guidance on -- even with our end of the quarter guidance, we don't get it down to the gross margin levels. So, I won't specifically address that. I'll talk a little bit about maybe some of the puts and takes. We talked about even last quarter that, sequentially, we would have less impact from the cost associated with the shutdown and the various operational disruptions we had in Japan. That would be a positive factor also to last quarter. Certainly, utilization weighs on gross margin, although I would say, to a lesser degree today than if you go back a number of years ago just because Analog and Embedded Processing tend to be less capital intensive and relative to revenue, those fixed costs would tend to be lower as a percentage. And then some of the positive offsets, of course, tax won't have any impact on cost of goods although some of the variable compensation pieces would flow through cost of goods as well. Do you have a follow-on, Romit?
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.
Yes, Ron. I understand that the deal hasn't closed yet but previously, you talked about $100 million in synergies from the National acquisition. Is there any change there just given the overall environment?
Ron Slaymaker
No, not at all. Maybe I can provide a brief update in terms of where we are with National and closing and it really is unchanged from what we talked about previously though. I think we had previously said we have cleared all the antitrust reviews. There were something like 12 to 15 various reviews that we went through around the world. All of those are clear with the exception of China, which remains underway. We have -- National has their shareholder approval, of course. That occurred on, I believe it was June 21 and we have all of our funding in place. So again, the only thing we're waiting on is the clearance through China. We've encountered no specific obstacles. It's just taking longer there as we had initially expected. As soon as we get the China approval, you'll see us issue a public statement and then we would expect to close the transaction within a few days of that notice. With respect to synergies, this remains about accelerating revenue growth at National. You know as well as we do they have not grown consistent with the Analog market overall. We believe we know how to turn that around and get their growth in Analog very consistent with what you've seen from TI, which is a very significant outperformance relative to the market. So revenue synergy is the basis for the acquisition and for the return that we believe we can drive on that acquisition. From a cost standpoint, we continue to expect that we will be able to achieve about $100 million of cost synergy and have that run rate, annual run rate, achieved about 12 months after the close of the acquisition. Okay, hopefully that helps. We'll move to the next caller.

And we'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch
Ron, what is your sense of the industry broadly? Is this downturn looking like a one quarter issue or do you think it could persist in the fourth quarter? Also I understand visibility is sort of limited right now.
Ron Slaymaker
That's correct. So I guess what I would say is, since this downturn is macro driven. We really have no special insight into how long it will take. By contrast, in an inventory-driven correction, we can make some assumptions about how much excess inventory exists and the burn rate of that inventory to then estimate what might be the duration of the correction. In this case, all I can really say is we're confident we'll return to growth whenever consumer and enterprise spending starts to increase again and we'll let you make the estimates on when that might be. Do you have a follow-on?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch
Yes. Just one other one. I'm curious why connectivity would be down but OMAP and Baseband up in Q3. Do they generally track each other? Or is there some other competitive issue at play here?
Ron Slaymaker
Not a competitive issue. It's simply a question of customer mix. We sell connect -- there's some overlap in our OMAP and our connectivity customer basis but not complete. And I would just describe that some of our biggest connectivity customers have not been performing as well in their markets recently and you're seeing that in our connectivity revenue. But again, I would describe it as much more a customer mix consideration than any kind of a competitive consideration. Let's move to the next caller.
Operator
And we'll go next to C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital
I guess first question. In terms of end market, I was hoping you could provide a little granularity there of the puts and takes that you're seeing, I guess in context of consumer and computing as being highlighted, the areas of weakness in July. Curious what you're seeing as of today?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, so you're right. In July, we really identified consumer and computing as areas where we expected below seasonal results in the current quarter. What's different today is basically that today we see broad-based weakness. It's across more customers and markets. For example, in July, we described that the industrial market was still stable for us. Today, it's weakening. So in general, I would describe a market trend as all broadly weaker really without any major exceptions. Do you have a follow-on, C.J.?
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital
I do. Given, I guess, the poor visibility you have today, uncertainty to the timing of recovery given how you stated it's macro driven, curious what your plans are today. You've got inventory growing Q-on-Q and would love to hear your thoughts on your plans for utilization and how we should think about the impact there to gross margins in the next quarter or 2.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, C.J., we're not going to give you a completely satisfying answer other than saying what I said before, which is we have pulled back on production starts. We began that process in June. Utilization, we would expect to be lower this quarter than second quarter as a result of that. Utilization is one of many factors on gross margin. As I said previously, we also have some -- we have puts as well as takes such as lower Japan-related costs but I'll probably just leave it there. And we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
And we'll go next to Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Ron, on your balance sheet inventories, I guess, there were 93 days coming into the quarter and, historically, there were as low as 63 days. I'm just wondering what's the right way to think about that number going forward?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, well, short term, as I said, 93 days will go higher. I think over the longer term, there has been, as you've noticed, a trend where our inventory levels have tended to move up. That's partly a nature of our product mix and as our revenue gets centered op more and more on Analog and Embedded Processing, and especially the catalog or standard product pieces of those product lines, as they become a bigger part of our revenue, those tend to be more off-the-shelf type of models certainly versus custom products, where we tend not to build until we have a customer commitment in hand. The good news is those catalog products, as I described before, in many cases will have a 10-plus year product life. So the risk of obsolescence, the risk of that inventory tends to be very low. There is some costs associated with that, but again the opportunity and the relative profit associated with those catalog products certainly justifies the cost of carrying it. The other thing I would mention, and you've heard us talk about this for sometime, is that inventory has tended to move upstream from distributors and from our OEMs to TI as we've implemented more customer-specific programs such as consignment. And frankly, yes, there is some costs to TI in terms of carrying that inventory but there's a huge benefit from the standpoint of that inventory is positioned where it's most flexible and it's also positioned where we have the greatest visibility. So the risk that you've seen in the past of various players hoarding inventory during times when the markets are hot and then having to deplete that inventory and what that amplifies in terms of the cycles on our business will be improved anyway by us carrying that inventory versus having it downstream from TI. So I'll just leave it with that. Srini, do you have a follow-on?
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Yes, Ron. On the end market discussion, you said most of the end markets are weak but PCN consumer, they have been weak for a while. I'm just wondering -- I mean are they continuing to weaken or at this point have they stabilized to a certain level?
Ron Slaymaker
I would say they're weaker than where we were expecting in July. And in July, what we were seeing was really not that we have seen those markets weaken or turn down versus we just weren't seeing customers' forecast seasonal growth in those markets. So I would say, they had -- again, it wasn't a turn down, it was just lack of growth. I would say, at this point, we would describe both of those have weakened. You might also be just interested in, from a geographical perspective, one thing that's happening there as we expected from a positive standpoint is we are seeing some lift out of Japan. So as those various customers get their factories online, we're seeing that post-earthquake recovery happen consistent with our expectation. We'll move to the next caller, please. This will need to be our last set of questions.
Operator
We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Ron, real quickly, I just wanted to probe on the OMAP comments you made about it being up strongly, how much of that is seasonality and how much of that is new design wins and just for us to gauge how sustainable that strength is beyond just this season?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. It is clearly new design wins. So it's not seasonality. It ties very specifically to programs that we've won, we've worked for some time, and we have customers now ramping or preparing -- ramping programs into production, preparing for their product launches, I guess is the best way of saying that. So in general, we're very confident in the strength of our design pipeline for OMAP products and that goes across a broad range of customers in both the tablet and smartphone markets. There's still a lot of work for us to do to turn those programs into revenue and we'll let our results there speak for themselves. I'm not going to try to give you a 2012 forecast for OMAP. But I will say that we have a solid ramp of programs, part of what we're experiencing today with a lot more of those yet to come. Do you have a follow-on, Uche?
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Yes, I do. The Baseband business, I mean, please correct me, did I heard you say it's going to be up?
Ron Slaymaker
Baseband, we do expect to be up. Was that a question or...
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
I mean I just wanted to clarify that before I ask my question. So are we still -- is it planned still to ramp this down to 0 or technically wind this down by the end of 2013, which is what you've said in the past. And the reason I ask this is that business has been resilient for much longer than one would have expected and should we still be modeling this to technically be gone by the end of 2013?
Ron Slaymaker
That's a great question, Uche, and you're exactly right. We expect that by the end of 2012 that business will be ramped down, that revenue will ramp down, such that we really have no revenue to speak of there in 2013. I think what you've seen is, you'll recall, the last 2 quarters, we saw very sharp declines in our Baseband revenue. Our customer there obviously was adjusting both based on just their new run rates but also probably taking care of some inventory of their products. And so you'll see a little bit of maybe seasonality come back, maybe also a little bit of just call it, the small snapback from that inventory correction that we saw in the second quarter. But it'll probably be a bit lumpy but the Baseband revenue, we do expect to decline through the end of next year.
And before we end the call, let me remind you that the replay is available on our website. Thank you and good evening.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments' Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our midquarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for September 8. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update. 
In today's call, in addition to our review of the second quarter's financial results, we'll describe the current demand environment and our perspective of how it is developing as we move into the second half of the year. We'll also update you on the status of our recovery efforts in Japan, as well as the status of our acquisition of National Semiconductor. 
I'll start with the demand environment. As a reminder, in April, we said that the impact in the second quarter from the events in Japan would be greater than in the first quarter, considering that we would be operating with only partial output at our factories there; that our Japanese customers were still in the early stages of restarting their own factories; and that we and our customers could face potential supply-chain disruptions. We also said that we believe the underlying demand was strong. 
In light of the anticipated Japan impact, the middle of our second quarter revenue guidance range that we provided in April was about half the seasonal average for our second quarter. In fact, the quarter developed largely as we had expected. With the exception of weaker demand from a single large wireless customer, our quarter progressed a little better than the midpoint of our initial expectations. You will recall that we adjusted our guidance downward at our scheduled June update in response to the weaker demand from that customer. Otherwise, we had a lot of positive demand signals in the quarter. These included an increase on our total backlog during the second quarter. Our best book-to-bill ratio was 1.04. Also, in Asia, where more than half our business is done, distributor resales grew 10% in the quarter. Finally, the situation in Japan is getting better. Not only do we have our own factories back in production, demand from our Japan customers is increasing. 
Against this positive backdrop, however, we also see some signs that are less encouraging. For example, we believe that computing and some parts of the Consumer Electronics market may not show this typical strength that we might otherwise expect, heading into the back-to-school and holiday periods. So, as a result of this increased uncertainty, we're preparing for a wider range of growth possibilities as we move into the second half. In the third quarter, we're planning for modest sequential growth. However, we'll keep our operations and inventory stage to support higher demand if it develops. This is an environment where we simply need to stay flexible to adjust to whatever develops. 
Turning to our second quarter's results, TI revenue of $3.46 billion was about even with a year ago and grew 2% sequentially. Revenue from our core businesses increased 8% from a year ago and grew 5% sequentially. In total, our core revenue was 73% of total revenue in the quarter, up from 67% a year ago and 71% in the prior quarter. The breakout of our core revenue results includes Analog, up 5% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. We believe we gained share this quarter in Analog. 
Embedded Processing grew 16% from a year ago and increased 12% sequentially. We believe we gained share this quarter in Embedded Processing. Wireless OMAP and connectivity revenue collectively increased 6% from a year ago and increased 2% sequentially. Noncore revenue declined 18% from a year ago and declined 6% sequentially. This was mostly affected by wireless basebands, where revenue fell 45% from a year ago and declined 32% sequentially to $228 million. Baseband revenue fell to below 7% of TI revenue in the quarter, down from 12% a year ago and 10% last quarter. 
Turning to our segments, the most significant drivers of Analog growth in both comparisons have been the catalog product areas, including both Power Management and high-performance Analog. These areas benefit from the scale advantage of TI's large field sales and application force, especially in the fastest-growing regions of the world. These are also areas where our product portfolio will be significantly enhanced by the addition of National Semiconductor's strong catalog product offerings later this year when we close that acquisition. High-Volume Analog and Logic or HVAL revenue was about even in both comparisons, as it was impacted by the earthquake damage at our Miho factory in Japan. 
The biggest factor in Embedded Processing revenue growth in both comparisons is communications infrastructure, where we continue to benefit from deployments in North America of 3G systems as carriers attempt to keep up with increasing amounts of data traffic associated with higher usage of smartphones and tablets. From a year ago, we also had strong automotive demand, although this slowed significantly on a sequential basis. Demand for our catalog products remained robust in the quarter, growing at double-digit levels on a sequential basis as we continue to take share across a range of microcontroller and DSP markets. 
Our Wireless segment revenue overall reflected a sharp decline in Baseband revenue. As we said in June, weaker demand from the same large customer that drove down our Baseband revenue in the quarter also affected the Core Wireless product lines. Fortunately, these products have a more diverse customer base and we were able to grow this core revenue despite the declines of that customer. In our Other segment, the revenue decline from year ago was primarily due to lower revenue from DLP products, lower royalties and the sale of a cable modem product line in the fourth quarter or 2010. Sequentially, the increase in revenue was due to higher seasonal calculator revenue, which was partially offset by lower revenue from DLP products. DLP revenue was impacted in both comparisons by lost production last quarter due to the earthquake damage to our Miho factory in Japan. When evaluating this segment's profit, please note that we are including earthquake-related costs of about $50 million and our National Semiconductor acquisition-related cost of $13 million in this segment this quarter. 
Turning to distribution, resales grew 2% sequentially. As one would expect, resales declined at a double-digit rate in Japan. Resales grew at a double-digit rate in Asia. The Americas were about flat and Europe was down single digits. Distributor inventory levels were essentially unchanged on a days basis. At just over 6 weeks, distributor inventory is consistent with historical levels and we believe remains appropriate. Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by providing an update on our recovery operations in Japan. The good news is that our production loadings were nearly back to full capacity by the middle of June. This recovery was ahead of our plan, thanks to a lot of hard work by our TI teams in Japan and across the world. The Hiji factory recovered first and has been in production for most of the second quarter. Our Miho factory, the one that was more severely damaged, was shut down during the first half of April and ramped steadily through May and the first part of June. 
As we've noted before, this is based on production loadings or wafer starts and there are a few months of lag between when we started wafer and when those products are shipped to our customers for revenue due to the manufacturing cycle time. As a result, our shipments and revenue in the third quarter will continue to have some impact from this lost production, although to a lesser extent. Our earthquake-related costs were about $50 million, net of proceeds from ongoing insurance claims. 
Almost all of these costs were included in cost of revenue and as Ron noted, were included in our Other segment. This includes costs, such as the underutilization expense we incurred from having our manufacturing assets only partially loaded, the recovery teams that we'd assembled from across the world, as well as other one-time costs. As a reminder, in the first quarter, these costs totaled about $30 million. 
So turning to our financial results, gross profit in the quarter increased $25 million sequentially. The profit contribution from higher revenue was partially offset by lower factory utilization levels and higher earthquake-related costs. The combination of R&D and SG&A increased 2% or $17 million from the first quarter. Most of this increase is from continued investment in our field sales and applications engineering force in emerging markets such as China. 
We have adjusted our estimates at TI's annual effective tax rate for 2011 to 27% due to lower expected taxable income. Net income in the first quarter was $672 million or $0.56 per share. Again, in the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units in which we pay dividend equivalents. In the second quarter, the amount of net income included from the EPS -- excluded from the EPS calculation was $10 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you will likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have reported. I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $631 million. This is up $115 million from last quarter, mostly reflecting the payment of accrued annual profit sharing and performance bonuses in the first quarter. 
Capital expenditures were $276 million in the quarter, up from $194 million in the first quarter and were mostly attributable to additions to our assembly and test capacity. We used $452 million in the quarter to repurchase 13 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $150 million. We increased our inventory by $84 million in the quarter. Although some of this resulted from weaker demand by a wireless customer in the quarter, most was planned and primarily due to the company building inventory to help support high customer service levels and to continue alternate factory sourcing for parts that were affected by the Japan earthquake. 
Although alternate sourcing provided minimal revenue benefit in the second quarter due to manufacturing cycle times, this work will provide TI greater flexibility in future quarters and provide our customers greater assurance, supply and continuity. Orders of $3.60 billion in the quarter were about even sequentially. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 in the quarter compared with 1.06 in the first quarter. 
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.40 billion to $3.70 billion in the third quarter or down 2% to up 7% sequentially. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.65. Our EPS estimate assumes about $0.01 impact from continued earthquake-related costs in the third quarter. Our estimates for 2011 R&D, capital expenditures and depreciation are unchanged. 
Before we turn to Q&A, let me provide a short update on our status with the National Semiconductor acquisition. At this point, we have completed all of the required antitrust reviews, with the exception of China. We expected China's review to be the last to complete and have not encountered any specific obstacles there. We continue to expect to have the acquisition closed by the end of this year. As some of you undoubtedly have noted, during the second quarter, we issued $3.5 billion of debt in association with this acquisition, with maturities ranging from 2 to 5 years. The average related annual interest rate is about 1.6% per year, including issuance costs. 
Earlier this month, we issued commercial paper for $1.2 billion at an annual interest rate below 0.19%, including issuance costs. Combined, this means that we will be incurring debt expense of about $15 million per quarter until we get the National acquisition closed. At that point, we'll update you with new debt expense guidance, as we'll also be paying interest on National's debt. With these transactions and our cash on hand, we have our finances completely in order to close the transaction once we receive antitrust clearance from China. 
In summary, our commitment and progress to becoming a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing should be clear to all. We have strong positions in both and are committed to making them considerably stronger. Both markets offer us an opportunity for long-term growth, while providing solid returns on our investments. In the near term, there is some uncertainty in our markets. Certain macroeconomic and market signals are indicating early signs of below seasonal growth as we enter the second half of the year, yet our business fundamentals have remained strong. During this period, we will remain especially diligent, while also being prepared operationally of our customer demand affect us. With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator instructions] Operator?

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Christopher Danely with J.P. Morgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Kevin or Ron, if you can just give us your rundown on -- for various end markets, is it just PC and consumer that's a little weak or is there anything else that's a little weaker or stronger than seasonal for Q3?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, I would say it's -- the areas that we've noted below seasonality. And again, this is from input from a few of our larger customers, and I would say most of them tend to be Asian-based, are limited to computing and again, some of the consumer markets. And when I say some of the consumer markets, specifically, I would note televisions, and maybe some of the gaming areas where we've seen some -- and again, when I say softness, it's not necessarily relative to second quarter, but we just haven't really seen the pick up that we might otherwise expect coming into a stronger second half. If I could kind of walk through some of the other areas, I'll let you know. I'll touch on automotive. Automotive, although actually was up sequentially for TI, but I would describe the gain is slight. So it wasn't a decline, and I think that reflects probably what we're seeing in the broader automotive market, where I think for example, in the U.S., we're seeing weaker than expected sales. I believe June was the second consecutive month of weaker sales, really tying more to the overall economy, probably in consumer spending, as well as possibly just to the tight supply of cars due to supply chain issues coming out of Japan. Handsets, the part we're focused on being smartphones, continues to do well. I think we'll see where the year lands but at least coming at this point, something like 50% growth compared to last year, and we have a good position there with connectivity and with our own map and a position that is only getting stronger, especially on the OMAP front as we move forward. While I'm on that communications side, wireless infrastructure, I really just reiterate what I said in the prepared remarks. Most of what has been driving us in first half is basically data capacity expansion in North America. There's growth in Europe as well, but I would describe that growth as at a slower rate. China and India have not really been big drivers, thus far this year, but we expect 3G rollouts in those countries to drive better growth in second half. So again, mostly North America first half. Industrial, I guess I would describe it steady. Look at the catalog areas, both on what we -- our comments that we had about high-performance Analog and power Analog. And I then would say also look at the comments we made on -- in catalog, embedded processing products. A lot of those type catalog devices tied to that broader industrial markets and I would say, very steady results so far. So I think that's probably a pretty broad sweep. Do you have a follow on, Chris?
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
One last question on your own inventory. I think inventory days remain in the low 90s. How do you guys feel about that level of inventory days, specially considering what usually happens in Q4? And then what would be your utilization rate forecast for this quarter?
Kevin March
Chris, on the inventory, if you take a look on the balance sheet, and look at the mix of inventory, you'll actually see that our working process was up more than normal. So it's partly our raw materials up more than normal, and that was really a function of making sure that we procured enough raw materials, post-Japan earthquake, so that we wouldn't have material shortage in our factories. In addition, you'll see that our finished goods are up some. Part of that is the seasonality, due to the calculator back-to-school sales, and a little bit of that is the plan to build inside semiconductor products. But really, the work in process is where you see most of the build up and to a large extent, that's not only a plan to build to get ourselves back to customer service levels that we've been trying to achieve now for probably last 1.5 years, but that's also the result of bringing up our new factories and dual calling parts that were in the Miho factory that was damaged last quarter with the earthquake. So you get multiple effects going on driving inventory up. Because of the inventory stage that we actually feel quite good about, if the third quarter wants to turn out to be a little stronger than the current signal suggests to us, we're well staged to be able to meet that growth that customers actually need product sooner. The inventory for fourth quarter, we'll talk about in 90 days, when we get out of this quarter and see what happens at that point in time. As with utilization, I'll just comment that utilization was down a little bit in the prior quarter. In the second quarter versus prior quarter, and that was really a function of -- we do start adjusting loadings in first quarter, and that continued through second quarter. But at the same time, we also have underutilized capacity as we've talked about in the Japanese factories that were damaged. So together, those have cost utilizations to be down.
Operator
We'll go next to Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
It sounds like by the way you've given the guidance and visibility is certainly low. So I wondered if you look at where potentially, you could see upside, because it sounds like just from a prepared commentary, that's maybe how you're thinking about it. Where would you think that's possible if at all? And then as part of answering that, you also say you want to stay flexible. I recognize inventory maybe part of that, but what else is involved in staying flexible for your customers?
Kevin March
Glen, I would say on the upside, will probably be exactly those 2 areas where Ron had suggested that where we're seeing some softness or some lackluster growth forecast from our customers. That will be in the computing space, and in the consumer space, and with the TV and some of the gaming areas that we're looking at, it's also not out of the question that as these component shortages finally clear themselves up in the automotive space, that you may see a resumption of demand in that area as well. From an upside standpoint, I've already discussed the inventory profile. But at the same time, we're also just managing, not just the inventory that we have, but our overall factory loads and our overall spending plans as we go into the second half of the year. Just to be sure that we don't have spending getting up in front of our revenue growth.
Ron Slaymaker
And Glen, one thing I would comment just from the factory loads, and we've talked about this for some time, but maybe one positive consideration that came out of Japan was the fact that we're now getting more of our parts qualified in more factories, which just gives us more degrees of freedom when demand wants to upside, we're not limited to a particular factory and how much headroom we might have in that one factory. We have more opportunity at more factories. And in this case, with 3 of the factories being new factories, clearly we have a lot of headroom for upside to support there as needed. Do you have a follow on question?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
I do. Kind of switching gears, thinking about the opportunity in PCs that you see for OMAP, I wonder if you can give us a sense as to how important you think that opportunity is? And maybe put it in these terms, if you only had that opportunity for OMAP, just that PC opportunity, do you think it will be substantial enough for you to continue to work on OMAP going forward?
Kevin March
Boy, Glenn, that's a tough question to answer because we don't even envision that at all. I mean, clearly mobile is our priority with OMAP. We are highly focused on the smartphone space and the tablet space and frankly, we're probably not pursuing as aggressively in just the idea of OMAP somehow or ARM trying to work its way into a standard PC. Probably the opportunity we would view would be more just to the degree that tablets cannibalize into the lower end of the PC space or into the netbook space. Clearly, that's opportunity for OMAP. But that is such a significant opportunity for us and one where we are -- to some degree in the driver seat from the standpoint of the penetration that we have and the value proposition that we have with OMAP, and then probably in our mind, makes a lot more sense for us to focus on that than to go try to penetrate a mature market, such as the PC with OMAP. So I realize that probably wasn't as direct of an answer as you would've liked, but it really reflects our priority, which continues to be smartphones and tablets. And then, we are pushing OMAP into other spaces, such as eReaders, GPS devices, things like that but those certainly probably would be a higher priority for us than chasing down the traditional, more mature PC market.
Operator
We'll go next to Cody Acree with Williams Financial.
Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc.
Ron, maybe you can talk a little bit about linearity in the quarter. I guess what's really changed or has there been a significant amount of change since the June update? I guess when did you start to see the issues in computing and consumer?
Ron Slaymaker
So if we look at linearity, actually the quarter was, from an order standpoint, highly linear. Each month really, probably within plus or minus of a point was linear in the quarter. Revenue built sequentially as we moved to the quarter, but orders were highly linear. Now, what I don't know Cody, off the top of my head is, what is the typical linearity for orders in the second quarter. I think what changed, and I'll let Kevin make some macro-related comments that he would like, but more bottoms up is, we just started in the dialogue with customers in computing. And as I said in some of these consumer spaces, they just didn't come in with the kind of new order ramp for really looking into third quarter that we might otherwise have expected. Kevin, do you have any more macro-related comments?
Kevin March
Yes, I think that what's change in that area has really been a lot of the headlines that we're seeing with European and U.S. debt issues, and that's causing some of our larger customers to be making in the computer and consumer space, do have concern and that may cause anxiety among consumers and dampen demand. So that's a bit of a change from what we saw 30 days ago or even 45 days ago, and really, it's just a reaction to a lot of unfavorable headlines as it relates to the debt and what that may mean to domestic demand in both Europe and the U.S.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Cody?
Cody Acree - Williams Financial Group, Inc.
Sure Ron, what is your confidence then that what we're seeing in consumer and computing isn't really a leading indicator of weakness, it starts to become more systemic through all the other segment?
Ron Slaymaker
Well, I think, and again, we just haven't -- we haven't seen signs of it elsewhere to the degree that it's macro and wants to spread. I don't think we have any direct visibility into that, but we certainly have not seen signs of that to this point. So what we're seeing signs of again is not weakening, it's not -- it's just not the typical turnout that you might expect seasonally in some of those other areas.

We'll go next to John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
Ron, I guess my first question, what drove the strength in the distribution Asia resell? And I guess my question is, are you seeing sort of softness in computing consumer this quarter because there was an inventory build of TI's specifics parts in the June quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
That's an interesting question, John. I don't know we have perfect visibility. When we look at the TI component inventory out there, we really maybe looking at it in 3 different buckets. One is what we have at distribution. Distribution now, of course about 40% of our revenue. You heard me say we're just at over 6 weeks of inventory, which feels very appropriate. So we'd say distribution inventory is fine. The next bucket would be OEMs where we have consignment programs. And by definition, that's fine because we're managing that inventory, we keep it lean, we keep it fast turning. And if you put distribution plus consignment together, you end up a little north of 2/3 of TI's total revenue. So for more than 2/3 of our revenue, we have good visibility, and we feel good about the inventory levels that are out there. For the remaining 1/3 of our business, I would describe -- we don't have direct visibility, but at the same time, we're not aware that there are significant inventory issues out there. So we feel in general pretty good about inventory but your point is your question is a good one, which is once something moves past our distributor and is into their customers, we lose direct visibility, and we don't really know what the inventory trends are out there. But again, we're not aware of any specific inventory issues. Do you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
Follow-on for Kevin, just around profitability. Kevin, how do I think specifically about gross margins in the September quarter. For me to kind of get to the low end of the EPS range, I've got to take a pretty healthy hit to gross margin. And conversely, despite the weaker revenue outlook, you haven't cut R&D outlook. I'm kind of curious as to why and what would you need to see to actually address the R&D outlook down?
Kevin March
So John, on the gross margin, I'm not sure how you're building your model there, but I would remind you that in the second quarter, we had about $50 million of net cost attributable to the earthquake in Japan. And almost all of that cost went against the gross margin line. Next quarter, we indicated we probably got about another $0.01 worth of cost that we expect in the third quarter, and again, that will go against the gross margin line. So I'm not really quite sure how you're building your model that'll be driving the gross margins down. In fact, seems it would go a little bit different just for no other reason, we don't have the same kind of overhang on that earthquake cost that we did this quarter. As to the R&D spend, R&D really a -- these are long-term kind of spend. These aren't the sort of things that you tend to swing around too much in the short term. And so as you've watched us for a lot of years now, when we set our R&D spend budget for the year, we rarely fluctuate much more than $100,000 plus or minus around that budget from the -- $100 million, excuse me, plus or minus around that budget that we set at the beginning of the year. And that's really because the whole intention of R&D is you're spending not for this year's revenue and sometimes, not even for next year's revenue but for revenue beyond that. So I would not anticipate making changes to this year's forecast for R&D. We'd have to see something of a similar drama that we saw coming out of '08 into early '09 for us to really change our spend plan on that front.
Ron Slaymaker
You don't see that on the horizon, right Kevin?
Kevin March
I do not.

We'll go next to Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Ron, you mentioned that there was some impact on OMAP in Nokia being weak. I'm just curious if you look at the OMAP and connect it with your business, what percent of that is still Nokia and how should we think about it going forward?
Ron Slaymaker
Srini, I don't have -- I can't tell you what percent of OMAP or connectivity is, as any particular customer. But just to reiterate what we said previously, is that our OMAP and connectivity customer base is much broader than our baseband customer base, where to a large part, we were building that product for a single customer. So we feel good about the diversity of that revenue and frankly, it's getting even more diverse, as we, especially in the OMAP space have a lot of new design wins that are basically in the pipeline of moving from development into production let's say over the course of the next year. So again, it's a more diverse customer base, but I can't break it out any finer for you than that. Do you have follow-ups, Srini?
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Yes, Ron. And you classified about 27% of your sales as non-core. We obviously know what's going to happen to the Baseband business going forward, but just curious as to what's your strategic plan sort of for the remaining 20% of the non-core business?
Kevin March
That strain of the restaurant business is made up of a variety of products. For example, our calculator business is in there. That enjoys great market share, especially in the North American education market, and that's a market that will continue to grow, although probably at very low single-digit kind of growth rates. Our DLP business is in that area and that also continues to do very well in some projection and has some very interesting emerging growth opportunities, particularly in Pico projectors and other types of applications of that nature. Our royalties are also in there. We don't normally expect much growth in that area. We have some other business. Our custom ASIC is in that area. That would characterize it as kind of very slow growth sort of area. And there's a few other miscellaneous types of things. Overall, if we look at the noncore products area minus baseband, because we've already talked Baseband will run its way to 0 by the end of 2012, but minus baseband, the remainder we're expecting to probably grow in the total 12.2% kind of range. Again over the years into the future.
Operator
We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Maybe Ron, let me re-approach the OMAP question again. I think it was a few quarters ago when you had talked about running out products and being able to come back and retake share. Obviously, we're not seeing that this quarter. Can you talk about what the outlook is for that business? Especially now that 4460 has been launched, that is probably one of the fastest performing product in this category right now? What is your sense as to the design pipeline and how should we think about growth for the apps processor business?
Ron Slaymaker
Uche, I think we feel really pretty optimistic about the outlook for growth in OMAP. We are doing very well with a range of different customers and a range of different products. I think we've told you before that in the case of OMAP 3, we had something like 50, more than 50 actually, different OMAP 3-based handsets in the market, and that was a handset count I think at the end of 2010. And what I can say is with OMAP 4, our designing rate has been even higher, and in fact, higher than any prior OMAP generation. So there are few customers that we publicly talk about because they have publicly announced their products in the tablet space that would be RIM with PlayBook. In the smartphone space, the LG Optimus 3D product is OMAP 4 based. We've also launched OMAP 5 in February of this year. So again, we have a great pipeline of products and product technology. But even more importantly, we have a great pipeline of design wins in the smartphone and the tablet space. And then as I said previously, that we will watch them develop over time by areas like eReaders, GPS, personal navigation systems, things like that, find OMAP to be just a great type of media process or application processor for their space as well. So we think it has a good growth outlook from revenue standpoint and we're certainly investing accordingly. Do you have a follow-on, Uche?
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
A slightly different question on the wireless -- with the comm infrastructure in China. Any comments you can make as to the rollout in the second half of the year, not just China but just in general? And also, as you're jump in for position with the PLD guys, your ASIC business versus PLD, what is your sense as to who's winning that contest right now? I mean but your last this day, you kind of talked about how your ASIC business will probably come back into that space. So any comments around the possible rollout in the second half, specifically on China? And then the ASIC business outlook.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, so I would say in terms of China and India, probably don't have a lot more granularity to provide other than what I have, which is just that we expect them to drive incremental growth in second half of this year. So we are well-positioned in those markets as we are just in comps and infrastructure-based station equipment across the world. So as those systems deploy in those regions, we will clearly be a participant. Our question of PLD versus ASIC, there's actually a step beyond both of those, which is system-on-a-chip, where we take the functionality that historically would've been in the standalone ASIC or a standalone FPGA type of device, and basically, integrate it onto our DSP for a much more optimized system. And I think when you start thinking about base stations and TI's content participation going forward, think more system-on-a-chip. So for example, 4G-related -- 4G type of systems, we already have system-on-a-chip for these systems, and that will mean that our content will be higher and frankly, our content will ramp earlier to the higher level than what it might have historically. But again, we have a great position DSPs and now, surrounding that DSP in a single chip implementation, the logic that gives us more of a system-on-a-chip functionality.
Operator
We'll go next to Tore Svanberg with Stifel Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
So looks like the Baseband business was sort of the main delta in the June quarter. So how should we think about that business now in the September quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Tore, probably the best I can say is what you've heard us say before, which is kind of take the $228 million we were at in the second quarter and straight line it down in a linear fashion to 0 by the time you get to the first quarter '13, we realize you're going to have quarters that are above that, quarters that are below that but really, that's probably the best forecasting approach we can provide you. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
That's fair. My second question is on linearity, maybe not as much bookings last quarter but just trying to understand how bookings have fared so far in this quarter, are we off to a fairly normal start?
Ron Slaymaker
I would say it's similar to -- it reflects the environment that we described for you and the outlook that we have provided. So in other words, we have not seen in the first 3 weeks of July, a big ramp in orders that would be reflective of a strong back-to-school or holiday season and consumer or in computing, but it's kind of that more lukewarm type of signal that we previously described for you.
Operator
We will go next to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.
Can you tell me, give me some feeling for how much lost production for Miho in Q3 might be baked into your guidance? And do you feel like how that fab been completely online and running, could you have sold everything that you ordinarily would've been making out of it?
Kevin March
Stacy, I would say that the lost production in this quarter is about -- as we've talked about, about $0.01 worth of earnings.
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.
Is that loss production or that's cost?
Kevin March
Pardon me, pardon me, it's cost. There will also be some lost revenue just because we can't sell the material until we get towards the end of the quarters. It comes out of the factory towards the end of the quarter. And we don't have a quantification for -- if that would be right down, because part of the outlook is changed versus what we're trying to do to get color 90 days ago, when we'll be coming in the second quarter. As it relates to the overall second quarter lost output, we have estimated it would cost us around $0.05 worth of lost revenue, we've got $0.05 of earnings in the second quarter, and that's pretty much about what it turned out to be. We have estimated that the incremental cost would be about $0.05 in the second quarter, that came in closer to about $0.03, net of an insurance settlement -- the ongoing insurance settlement we're able to achieve.
Ron Slaymaker
Stacy, do you have a follow up?
Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.
Just regarding what you're seeing in auto right now, do you think I guess the weakness that you're sort of indicating for now, is that just more supply constraints where if there -- if somebody else isn't shipping a part, then the car doesn't ship and nobody who is sending parts into those car ships anything? Is that the weak kind of weakness or is it more demand driven? And like what are your expectations for that market I guess as we move into Q4 of the year? Do you think it all normalizes out?
Kevin March
Stacy, I don't know that we have a great answer or visibility into the why of auto. I know car sales are down, I know, are weaker than expected. I know part of that, a large part of that is supply chain related. And if they can't get a critical component from somebody else in the supply chain, then they sure don't need the parts that we would sell into it. How much of it is the consumer nervousness, just based on kind of what Kevin talked about previously going on at the macro level, they're very likely could be some of that as well, but what we know is, supply chain has impact to that.
Operator
We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
You guys referred to shared gains in Analog and Embedded Processing. Is there any incremental color you can give on specific subsegments or end markets where you think you picked up some share?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't know that I can do it real broadly, but if you take Embedded Processing, and again, it's always a little difficult at this point because we haven't seen everybody else's results to be able to really extrapolate but clearly, the strength of our position in comp infrastructure and the results that we're publishing here in that space, as that's clearly a contributor for TI gaining share in Embedded Processing. But I think it's actually things are more broad than that. I mean if you look at the catalog areas, we grew double-digit levels in catalog Embedded Processing revenue and probably, the main driver of that was on the microcontroller side and that's a sequential number. So it probably stands to reason that we're gaining share in catalog micro-controllers and catalog DSPs probably as well. So I think both of those areas are important for us. I think when you get into the Analog space, let me just leave it at kind of where I described before. I think when you talk about the broad catalog space, and that includes both power, as well as the broader HPA market, I think you probably would have to say that catalog and therefore, product sold through distribution products that really leverage the fact that we have probably 4x the number of salespeople as our closest Analog competitor out there, identifying opportunities and designing in our products. That would probably be the theme, I would say, for market share gains. I don't have an update at this point to take it down into was it amplifiers or specific product segments, but probably, the more broad catalog category would be the theme. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Yes, a couple of your competitors, in particular, were pretty vocal this quarter about you guys being somewhat aggressive on pricing. I mean is that kind of an isolated situation or is that something that was more strategic on your part as you begin to fill up some of the fab capacity?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, I think every time a competitor loses share to TI, we hear the pricing complaint coming back to us. I don't think we're doing anything different on pricing than what we've done historically. Frankly, our sales guys and gals are aggressive for pursuing new design wins. But that doesn't mean that we're out aggressive on pricing. We just fundamentally believe that when it comes to Analog, when it comes to Embedded Processing, pricing is pretty far down the list of customer considerations when they're picking a supplier for a particular component. And things that first and foremost, the performance of the product, the match of the product to the customer system needs, the amount of support that TI can provide in the form of applications engineers, in the form of kind of factory capacity that they see TI bringing online compared to our various competitors. Those are the considerations that drive customers' decisions to select TI versus a competitor. Absolutely, we have to be -- we have to keep our pencil sharp on pricing, we have to be competitive on pricing but it's not pricing that's causing TI's share gains. So again, it's not the first time I've heard, then I'm sure, won't be the last time I've heard that one.
Operator
We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch
The wireless operating margins came down in the second quarter, which I assume is due to the baseband declines. Two questions. If baseband continues to decline, will that continue to be an overhang on wireless margins? And just longer term, I wanted to understand that if you do see growth in wireless, but it comes at much lower margins than Analog and embedded, then does it still make sense to invest in this business?
Kevin March
Let me just address that question on the margins. The operating margins were down in wireless on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And in part, that's just the gross margin dollars that leave that P&L with the lack of revenue that we have on the baseband. But another part of it is as Ron indicated earlier, we are seeing an increasing number of design wins across a portfolio of products and in larger number of customers. And to support those design wins, we're also increasing our staff level, to make sure that we provide an adequate support. So you've got really 2 things going on in there. One of them is the baseband revenue decline, and this is associated to the margin coming out. And the other is the fact that we're increasing our support of customers as a result of us actually winning additional design wins. And in terms of looking to the future, we've said for quite a while that the non-baseband portion of our wireless segment needs to grow and grow rapidly in order to get a certain amount of revenue base that makes sense to the financial model. And I can tell you that the leaders of that particular product is very focused on that. And frankly, with the design wins that they have been successful in getting at lately, it is increasingly encouraging that we may in fact, begin to see more favorable results and certainly, in time for when the baseband business probably winds down completely. I won't try to predict any decision as to the question you've asked about when does it make sense to stay in or stay out, I won't try to go there. I would just simply point out that once again, with the design wins we've got going there, we have been adding additional resources to support those, and we're quite encouraged that we should start seeing that trend into meaningful revenue growth in the not-too-distant future.
Ron Slaymaker
And I would just add the gross margins that OMAP and connectivity run at are fully consistent with Texas Instruments. And so, what Kevin's describing is really more tied to the level of investment that we're making on operating expense as opposed to a disconnect between those product lines gross margins and what TI would see, for example, in Analog or Embedded Processing. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?
Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch
Yes, just a quick follow-up there, a slightly different topic. I think you mentioned that third quarter, some of the conservatism that you have around the consumer and computing. Could you remind us how much exposure do you have to those areas and how much do you expect to grow or decline versus your expectations? Because I'm trying to reconcile your consciousness versus the in-line to stronger guidance that we saw from Intel and of course, I understand your consumer trends are very different.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Vivek, and can give you -- I will give you the state and secondly, let me comment though. I think even our friends at Intel talked about lower units than what they had previously been expecting. But for them, it would translate to a richer mix. I suspect for TI, we're probably more sensitive to units than mix, given just the type of products we sell in as opposed to their microprocessor business. Okay, if I just look at first half of this year, I'll walk down all the end equipment areas and give you what percent of TI's revenue. Communications is 41%, computing 23%, industrial 14%, consumer 10%, automotive 8% and education will be 4% and that is primarily our calculator revenue. Let me give you a sub-breakout of computing because not all of these will necessarily apply to our outlook. So PCs, of that 23% -- I'm sorry, these will sum up to the 23%, PCs in first half '11 are about 9%. Storage, hard disk drives et cetera, 6%; servers, 1%; monitors, 5%, which is really the DLP front projector revenue; and printers would be 2%. So hopefully, that helps.
Operator
We'll go next to CJ Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital
I know you guys don't guide to gross margin, but it looks like at the midpoint, it's roughly up 50 bps and I guess the question I have, is that entirely due to the roll-off of one-time charges from Japan or is there also a mix issue here?
Kevin March
CJ, I won't get into a whole lot of specifics. I will comment that clearly, the roll-off of the cost strike for Japan is contributing to what our expected outlook would be. Beyond that, I won't get into any further mix discussion on that. I'll just leave a little put on that 90 days.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, CJ, do you have a follow-on?
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital
Yes, just for housekeeping, can you tell me what the actual share count was exiting 2Q, and should we be modeling 27% tax rate for all of fiscal '12?
Kevin March
Yes, CJ, the diluted share count, the average diluted share count for the second quarter was 1180. So 1.180 billion, and the period share count, basic share count was 1,155,000,000. These are the shares that we actually pay dividends on. As to the tax rate, yes the revision we've given is a 27% tax rate, which we believe, that the tax rate should apply for the entire year, including the balance of the year.
Ron Slaymaker
And I think our prior tax rate guidance, Kevin, was 28% but it's probably more rounding up to 28% or 27.5% or change, something rounding up to 28%, is that correct?
Kevin March
That's correct. And similarly, we're rounding down to 26% right now.
Ron Slaymaker
To 27%?
Kevin March
27%.
Ron Slaymaker
To 27% so in reality, the delta is probably a few tenths of a point in the tax rate, but we -- our guidance is not that granular. Operator, I think we'll have time for 1 more caller please.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
Gross margin question and we'll look backwards so maybe Kevin, you can talk a little bit more about it. If we look year-over-year in the second quarter, I realize you have charges this year and even a little higher depreciation, but the gross margin is still down a good 2, 3 points. Can you just walk us through quickly what is the cause of that?
Kevin March
Sure. Ross, I think the highest level to look at is you're right, it's probably down about 3.5 points versus a year ago. And the single biggest driver is the cost of the earthquake damage that we talked about. That's probably 1.5 points of that delta. Utilization is probably another point. Keep in mind that we brought on additional capacity during this period, there's probably about 0.5 points or so attributable to just slightly the lower revenues, and another 0.5 point attributable just to year-over-year changes in pay and benefits and raw material costs, and just commodities and so on.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
So mix doesn't have any implication at all?
Kevin March
Not enough to really make a difference. It's really -- these are the larger moving pieces that are going on inside there.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
I guess my quick follow on, Ron. I think on the midquarter update, you talked about the disti resales you hope to be up kind of mid-single digits, I think you said they're up 1% or 2%, is that just splitting hairs to notice any difference there, or is there something going on?
Ron Slaymaker
Resales were up 2% sequentially and off the top of my head, I don't recall specifically what we were saying midquarter. If you're saying mid-single digits, that could say they were 1 point or 2 off, but I don't recall that number and I don't recall the variance. And Kevin, been here shaking his head. So neither one of us can help you on that one, Ross. Okay, so with that, thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

And again, that does conclude today's call. We do appreciate everyone's participation.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Texas Instruments' First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the Web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 8. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update. 
In today's call, in addition to a review of the first quarter's financial results, we'll describe the current demand environment. We'll discuss the impact the Japan earthquake has had on demand and on our operations in that country. We'll also update you on our recovery plans and our anticipated costs associated with the earthquake and its aftermath.
I'll start with the demand environment. As a reminder, in January, we said we believed the inventory correction that had occurred in the second half of 2010 was largely complete and that we expected demand in the first quarter to be above our seasonal average. There is much evidence that this did happen. Specifically, orders were strong, resales were very strong and our core businesses performed well.
That said, we had two incidents that created noise on top of this strong underlying demand signal: the earthquake in Japan and late quarter unexpected weakness in Baseband demand by a single customer. In fact, during the month of January and February, we were tracking consistent with our expectations for above seasonal demand, which led us to narrow our revenue and earnings guidance ranges at our mid-quarter update around the prior midpoints. 
In March, the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our revenue due to the disruption at many of our customers' Japan factories as well as damage to two of our factories in Japan. This impact combined with our Baseband customers' unexpected weakness resulted in revenue in the lower half of our expected range. As we have previously explained, Baseband is a product line that we are exiting, and since our resources there have already been minimized, it has practically no long-term impact on us. 
The revenue impact from the events in Japan will be greater in the second quarter than in the first quarter, considering that we will only be operating with partial output at our factories there, that our Japanese customers are still in the early stages of restarting their own factories and that we and our customers may face potential supply chain disruptions. We're working closely with our suppliers to get what we need, but it's too early for us or anyone else to say these issues are resolved. In a few minutes, Kevin will update you on the recovery status of our factory operations in Japan.
The key point is that we believe underlying demand continues to be strong. The earthquake has had an important near-term effect on our business, but we do not believe it is disruptive to the underlying demand trends. As a result, we believe that second half will be strong once the short-term impact of the earthquake has passed.
In total, TI revenue of $3.39 billion grew 6% from a year ago and declined 4% sequentially. Revenue from our core businesses increased 14% from a year ago and was even sequentially. In total, our core revenue was 71% of total revenue in the quarter.
The breakout of our core revenue results includes Analog up 12% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 21% from a year ago and declined 1% sequentially, Wireless OMAP and Connectivity revenue increased 10% from a year ago and declined 3% sequentially.
Non-core revenue declined 10% from a year ago and declined 12% sequentially. This was mostly affected by Wireless Basebands, where revenue fell 21% from a year ago and declined 23% sequentially to $334 million. This sequential decline was well below the seasonal average, and the month of March was exceptionally weak; below January, in fact.
We believe the decline does not reflect on demand in the broader smartphone market but instead was the result of weaker demand for this particular line of 3G handsets. Although we don't believe a competitive chip offering will be available until late this year, we do not expect a seasonal recovery in this revenue in the upcoming quarters and, in fact, expect that it will continue to decline.
Baseband revenue fell to below 10% of TI revenue in the quarter, down from 12% last quarter. Other non-core revenue fell 2% from a year ago and fell 5% sequentially. 
Turning to our segments.  The most significant driver of Analog growth from a year ago was High-Performance Analog. Power Management and HVAL were both up by similar amounts, although by a lesser amount than HPA. Sequentially, Power was up the most, with HVAL about even and HPA down a few points. 
The biggest factor in Embedded Processing revenue growth from a year ago was catalog products, with communications infrastructure and automotive products both up strongly but by lesser absolute amounts. Sequentially, products sold into automotive applications were up the most, growing at double-digit levels, while communications infrastructure and catalog products both declined.
You'll note that our catalog products in Embedded Processing and Analog, including both HPA and Power, have grown rapidly over the past year. These are products that are typically sold through distribution into a wide array of customers and applications. For example, in Embedded Processing, we're seeing recent strength in a lot of industrial applications, such as motor drives in China, metering applications in Europe as well as higher demand in security and medical applications. These are areas where the scale advantage of TI's sales force means that we are identifying an increasing number of opportunities and are working hand in hand with our distributors to ensure these customers' systems are chock full of TI's analog chips, digital signal processors and microcontrollers.
These are also the areas that will be further strengthened by our recently announced plans to acquire National Semiconductor. Adding National's 12,000 analog products to TI's existing Analog portfolio of 30,000 products will significantly enhance our portfolio. Having a combined sales force that is 10 times the size of what National has today should also significantly accelerate their growth. We expect very good things to come from this combination.
Wireless revenue will increasingly be driven by our core product areas of connectivity and OMAP applications processors. We continue to be encouraged by our design win momentum in both areas. In applications processors, we introduced our OMAP 5 processor in the quarter, a multi-core product based on ARM's latest Cortex-A15 core. The key to OMAP 5 is that we will again push the envelope on both performance and power efficiency. Many of our competitors in this market try to attain our leadership performance metrics without fully appreciating the critical importance of power efficiency to mobile applications.
We have also continued to win a broad swath of smartphones, tablets, eReaders, personal navigation devices and other mobile computing applications with our OMAP 3 and OMAP 4 products, setting the stage for strong OMAP growth over the next few quarters as these programs ramp into production.
In our Other segment, the revenue decline from a year ago was primarily due to lower royalties that were mostly offset by revenue from our transitional supply agreements. Sequentially, declines in custom ASICs and royalties were partially offset by higher revenue from calculators and DLP products.
Turning to distribution. Resales grew a very strong 8% sequentially. On average, resales would more typically decline a couple of points in the first quarter. Although we were able to help distributors increase their inventory at an absolute level, their TI inventories declined by a couple of days given the strong resale environment. 
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by providing an update on our recovery operations in Japan. As Ron said, we had two wafer fabs damaged by the earthquake: our recently acquired Aizu fab and our Miho factory. Our operations teams have done a great job responding to the crisis.
We will soon be restoring Aizu into full production status and just last week, we started initial production in Miho. We expect that Miho will be able to start full production volumes in mid-July, although it will be several months later before we see the revenue effect due to the manufacturing cycle time. In the meantime, we've identified alternative TI manufacturing sites for 80% of the devices that we manufacture in Miho, and we are working with customers on these qualifications. Of course, this transition will take some time to complete.
In addition to the lost output and, therefore, lost revenue that was associated with this disruption, we are also incurring additional costs. These costs include the underutilization expense we incur from having our manufacturing assets only partially loaded, scrap inventory, the recovery teams that we've assembled from across the world as well as other onetime costs. 
In the first quarter, these costs totaled about $30 million, almost all of which was in cost of revenue. We recorded this in our Other segment. The situation in Japan will remain fluid as we progress and gather information. We will continue to communicate with you as well as our customers as we learn more.
Gross profit in the quarter declined $141 million sequentially. This included the impact of almost all the previously mentioned earthquake costs. The remainder of the gross profit decline was mostly associated with our lower revenue. It also includes the seasonal effect of increased holiday and vacation time in the fourth quarter as well as the first quarter's annual pay and benefit increases.
The combination of R&D and SG&A increased $36 million from the fourth quarter. We've continued to increase our investment in our core businesses, especially targeted programs in Analog and microcontrollers. We've also continued to increase our field sales and application engineering resources in important emerging markets such as China.
We have adjusted our estimate for TI's annual effective tax rate for 2011 to 28%. This is partly the result of lower expected taxable income, which includes considerations such as our earthquake-related costs and certain anticipated acquisition-related costs.
Net income in the first quarter was $666 million, or $0.55 per share. In the earnings-per-share calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units on which we pay dividend equivalents. In the first quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was about $10 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have actually reported.
When comparing with our $0.78 of EPS in the fourth quarter, recall that the fourth quarter included $0.14 from the combination of the gain on sale and a tax benefit that was primarily associated with the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit that was retroactive to the beginning of 2010. I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me just make a few comments.
Cash flow from operations was $516 million. This was down $714 million from the last quarter. Cash flow reflects lower net income and the payment of accrued annual profit sharing and performance bonuses in the first quarter. Capital expenditures declined to $194 million in the quarter from $301 million in the fourth quarter and included additions to our assembly and test capacity as well as our analog wafer fab capacity.
We used $771 million in the quarter to repurchase 21.9 million shares of TI common stocks and pay dividends of $153 million. We increased our inventory by $158 million in the quarter. Most of this increase was planned and supports our goal to maintain short lead times and support high customer service levels. About 1/3 of the increase was wireless Baseband inventory that resulted from unexpected weak demand from a single customer.  We've already taken action to begin to correct the excess Baseband inventory.
Orders in the quarter increased 14% sequentially to $3.58 billion. TI's book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.06 in the quarter from 0.89 in the fourth quarter.
Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.41 billion to $3.69 billion in the second quarter, or up 1% to 9% sequentially. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.60.
Prior to the earthquake, we were planning for low double-digit second quarter revenue growth. Because of the earthquake, we have reduced this near-term outlook to about half our normal seasonal growth, mostly due to a combination of lower output of our Japan factories, lower local Japan demand as well as potential supply chain disruptions. The foregoing profit on this revenue would be about $0.05 of EPS in the quarter. 
Additionally, the EPS estimate we have provided includes about $0.05 of negative impact for earthquake-related costs. So in total, the second quarter EPS impact from the earthquake is about $0.10. Our estimates for 2011 R&D, capital expenditures and depreciation are unchanged.
In summary, we're encouraged by underlying demands, as evidenced by orders and our trends during the first 2.5 months of the first quarter. Although we certainly have a near-term operational challenge associated with the earthquake and its aftermath, we're confident that this impact will be confined to the near term, and we're looking forward to a strong second half of the year.
Our market position is solid and will only get better as we bring the National portfolio and team onboard later this year. We remain focused on growing our core businesses significantly faster than the markets, and we're intent on translating that growth into attractive earnings and returns to our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
"
2011-04-19,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
I guess, Ron, the first question is, given the hiccup on the Baseband business this quarter, how should we think about that going forward? I know you said don't expect a seasonal recovery. But when you look at the guidance for Q2, how would you have us model that business?
Ron Slaymaker
John, I would say probably unchanged from what we have told you in the past. Although, certainly, it looks like that guidance has more and more opportunity to come to fruition here, which is basically we still expect that by the end of 2012, that revenue will be essentially gone. And so kind of a linear progression from where we were in first quarter down basically to 0 in first quarter '13 would be about the best we could provide in terms of guidance.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
I think as my follow-up, when you look at the op profitability on the Analog business, on op revenue, operating profits were down almost $70 million sequentially. I'm just kind of curious if you can talk a little bit about pricing in that business currently? And also, when you look at the weakness in the high-performance market, is that expected to rebound in the second quarter? And why was Q1 so weak for that segment?
Kevin March
John, profitability was down, back to the initial comments I made about our increased investments in certain projects. And Analog and Embedded Processes, a similar story holds in Embedded Processing as well. We have stepped up our spending on product development in those areas. In addition, as I mentioned, we're increasing our sales people and field apps engineers in support of those areas. So actually, similar to what we did a year ago in Embedded Processing.  Where we stepped up the investment there, we've done it again this year, stepping up the investment in both those segments.
Ron Slaymaker
Great. John, thank you for your questions, and we'll move to the next caller, please.
Operator
The next is Tim Luke, Barclays Capital.
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital
As you plan going forward, how should we think about your inventory level? Obviously, it's up a little bit in this quarter. How are you thinking about that trending as you move into the year?
Kevin March
Tim, I'll go ahead and take that. We don't normally give a inventory forecast per se because that's really more a function of what the following quarter's outlook would be, so we won't give you a specific number. But I would just remind you of what we talked about. We've already taken actions to start bringing the Baseband inventory down, and so we would expect that to decline during the second quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Tim?
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital
Sure. As you describe the outlook for the second half of the year, you say that you expect a quite good second half. Where are the areas that you see the greatest grounds for optimism around the second half? And maybe as part of that, it did look like your book-to-bill, your order numbers were strong in the quarter. And maybe you can give us some color as to where you saw the best lift in the order book.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, Tim, I don't think we believe it's necessarily going to be driven by any particular market segment. In fact, I think that's part of the reason why we're somewhat optimistic, because we see it as just being pretty broad-based underlying strength. That certainly happened. As we said in the prepared remarks, there were some noise in the first quarter. But if you peel back pretty much the isolated events, one Baseband customer and a Japan earthquake, underlying business was really pretty strong. In fact, I think if you look at the Baseband numbers, we gave you them pretty specifically. You see pretty much $100 million decline, of which about half of that was unexpected. So basically, we had about a $50 million unexpected decline in Baseband. We had about the impact of the Japan earthquake on revenue, since it came so late in the quarter, was about $20 million. But you look at where we were relative to our guidance, we were below the middle of the range but not very far below, which means areas outside of Baseband and outside of the Japan-related impact actually ran pretty strong in the quarter. So again, we have to kind of get through second quarter and some of the noise associated with Japan. But we think that broad-based strength will then become increasingly evident once we get into second half. But again, not driven by any particular area, but rather broad-based. Okay. Tim, thank you, and let's move to the next caller.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Kevin, maybe I'll just go back to your comments on Japan. With regards to how your customers have reacted to it, have there been any -- one would expect subsequent to an event like that there would be a jump in safety stocks and people will try to make sure they are not having any stock-outs. Did you see any such, and has that kind of stabilized as we look at how demand could trend for the rest of the quarter? And also, while you're answering that, if you can also talk about any adjacent products, like, we're hearing about wafer supplies being tight still from Japan, if you're exposed to that or if any such comment is true.
Kevin March
Uche, on customer reactions to the earthquake, again, I'll go back to what Ron said. We actually saw quite strong demand during the first 2.5 months of the quarter that really outside of the Baseband and direct Japan impact continued through the quarter. I don't think that we can necessarily point to any specific example of where people might be moving to take on more inventory or safety stock. But by the same token, I don't know that's an unreasonable thing for us to think that, that could occur. It's probably a little bit too early, though, for us to be able to point to any meaningful examples of that. As it relates to supply side, that is one of the things that we're mindful of in the second quarter outlook. And as we've talked about before, many semiconductor suppliers, that is suppliers of raw materials to semiconductor manufacturers such as TI and others, actually have the manufacturing facilities in the earthquake zone. And in many cases, those particular suppliers have been working to bring their factories back online. We've been working with them as well as other suppliers to try to ensure continuity to our total supply. But right now, I'd say the situation remains too fluid to really be able to give, either from us or anyone else, any certainty as to what that supply situation will look like until we get further through the second quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Uche, did you have a follow-up to those questions?
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
I do. Actually, a different question. Ron -- and I know you talked about investing in both Embedded and Analog Processing -- Embedded Processing and Analog as kind of the reason for the gross margin weakness. Is there any specific change in mix, particularly if we look at Embedded, you know, where you talked about communications infrastructure as well as automotive being down? So is there any other thing more significant going over in Embedded beyond just investments that may have resulted in the margins being a little bit weaker?
Ron Slaymaker
Not outside of what we talked about. You always have some variation across catalog products or automotive or comm infrastructure, which are the three categories that we discussed there. But I think other than what we discussed in our prepared remarks or put in the release, there's nothing that jumps to my mind that would have been what I would call a mix change. Do you have anything, Kevin, that comes to your mind?
Kevin March
Not in those two segments specifically. I would just say broadly speaking, at the company level, we did talk about the cost of revenue took an impact for the Japan damages cost of about $30 million. We also mentioned that royalty revenue was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. In addition to that, I did mention in my prepared remarks that the compensation-related costs in our manufacturing areas, like in the other areas, we had the benefit of the seasonal decline of vacation in the first quarter offset by paying benefit increases in the first quarter. So that combination of events all pools together to deliver the GPM results that we look at.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you, Uche, and we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
The next is Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Kevin, for you maybe. We obviously now have down gross margins with all the goings-on in the first quarter. Can you maybe provide for us the path back to the mid-50s on gross margins? What are the things that need to happen sort of correcting, for lack of a better term, the issues in Japan? And what else do we need to see to get us back to the mid-50s?
Kevin March
So Glen, I would first say that we're probably going to be a quarter or two out on that. Keep in mind, I did mention that there was about $0.05 of additional impact that we expect in the first quarter related to the Japan earthquake -- excuse me, in the second quarter, and most of that is going to be in cost of revenue. So we're probably in the third quarter before we see a resumption of those gross margins back in the level that we prefer to see them operating at. And really, I think an interesting point that should be noted there that Ron brought up in his comments, 71% of our revenue in the first quarter was our core products, and those tend to be our products that enjoy very healthy gross margins. So as we move through time and Baseband continues its wind-down and so on, all those things will come together and help support more reliable and solid gross margins starting in the second half of the year.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-up, Glen?
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
I do. It's kind of end-market-related. You sort of brought up a little bit, but just wanted to get your sense as to what you're seeing in a few end markets: wireless infrastructure, automotive and industrial.  Just what you saw and what you expect to see in those end markets.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Let's start with wireless infrastructure. I mean, so first quarter, we saw things down sequentially there, but I think that is pretty much a seasonal pattern that we would expect to see what were drivers of the revenue even though there was a seasonal decline was still, most of the revenue was associated with North American data expansion. We did see some increased volume in China, really in more kind of legacy GSM 2G type of sales. And again, we have no change to the outlook that you've heard us talk about over time, which is we think we're really at the start of a very long growth spurt that's really going to be based on data traffic capacity expansion that's going to go across the world. And so on the one hand, you'll see CapEx spending increases, especially in the wireless area, we believe, by various service providers. But we actually think our opportunity to grow will be actually significantly above those CapEx increases, really because we're catching more the bill of material via integration. So just for example, we used to sell DSPs. Today, we sell Layer 1 system-on-a-chip. In the future, we're going to be selling Layer 1, 2, 3 system-on-a-chip and really capture more of the customers' system opportunity via that higher-level service. Automotive, you heard us say we're strong. A lot of that was driven by unit sales increases in automotive.  I think just in the month of March, they were up something like 17% year-on-year. This is an area that we believe the end market will be impacted by the Japan earthquake, and I don't mean so much end market meaning consumer demand, but rather the automotive manufacturers' ability to supply given various constraints in terms of their supply chain. So that's one we're going to watch. But first quarter was strong, maybe a little more dampened outlook going forward. And then industrial, I would say good strength, not only in first quarter. Our view is that's the market that's going to continue strong as we move through 2011, and I would say that's across multiple regions, U.S., Europe, but also, as you heard me say in prepared remarks, even out of China as they continue to expand, not only their local economy but their supply into the rest of the world. Okay, Glen, thank you, and hopefully that answers your question. Now we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
The next is John Barton with Cowen.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC
Kevin, if you could go back to that $0.05 cost from the earthquake in the June quarter, just break it out a little bit on our utilization charge, scrap product, restart costs and also your thoughts in all those categories what could stretch into September, please.
Kevin March
Yes, John, we aren't going to go any lower than this data. Right now, we're estimating about $0.05 of cost and EPS, and it will be mostly manufacturing-related. Obviously, some of that will be in those categories you just described as well as repair costs and other types of costs associated with bringing the lines back up. But I'm not going to go any deeper than just to say it's about $0.05 or so in the quarter we expect right now.
Ron Slaymaker
Try with another one, John.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC
And that goes to 0 in the September quarter?
Kevin March
Right now, we can't see that far out with a great deal of clarity, so we withhold any kind of forecast on third quarter until we get closer to it.
Ron Slaymaker
We'll probably give you more on that in July. Okay. John, I'll give you one more.
John Barton - Cowen and Company, LLC
Back to the book-to-bill, 1.06. Where was it tracking before the earthquake, and what I'm after there is how much of an increase of bookings did you see as customers tried to give you visibility and/or create safety stock?
Ron Slaymaker
John, I would describe the order trend as strong throughout the quarter. We did see some turn-up in the couple of weeks, last couple weeks of March associated with maybe customers, as you described, trying to provide more visibility. But that was not a big factor. Book-to-bill and our order trends were solid literally from the start of the quarter all the way through. Okay. John, thank you, and we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
The next is Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
With regard to your comments about a good second half, I'm just curious what would constitute a good second half for you guys? If you're seasonal, would that be a good second half [indiscernible] somewhat better than the seasonal? How should we think about that?
Ron Slaymaker
Sure. Do you have a follow-up question? I mean, Steve, we're already out on the limb trying to talk about in general things turning back up in the second half. I don't know that we're sitting here trying to say whether it would be above seasonal. But certainly, a seasonal-or-better second half is what we would characterize as a strong second half, and it's kind of in the range of thinking that we have. Do you have a follow-on?
Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Sure. You had, I think, an above-seasonal Q1, very solid bookings here. And you're talking about this good back half, and that's sort of in the context of some discussion of PC weakness out there and high oil prices and debt ceilings and sort of a lot of negative macro data points. Just curious how you sort of put those two together, the negative macro data points and your seeming strength. Is it share gains?  Is it something else? If you could just give some thoughts there. I know you guys aren't economists, but any thoughts there would be helpful.
Kevin March
Again, I think, Steve, what we're seeing here is just a general broadening of the economic recovery around the world, including the Western economies that we've been watching, and it's surprisingly weak for a long period of time. That, along with the proliferation of electronic devices, gives us confidence that there's going to be quite a bit of long-term growth for semiconductors. I think we talked in the last couple of calls about our interest in the emergence of, say, tablet PCs, for example, where our particular content in tablet is more than it is in PCs. So actually, that transition from PC weakness to tablet strength we view positively. The emergence of the data communications demand that Ron was talking about earlier just puts more and more demand on the networks, and we have a lot of content inside those. We view that very favorably. The fact that automobile sales were somewhat depressed during the last couple of years as people kind of held on to their cash and their cars are getting older, they eventually have to replace some electronic content that continues to go up inside those cars. Again, that gives us confidence that semiconductor content is going to be quite attractive as we look into the future. So no particular area and no debate on some of the macro headlines that you're talking about. It's just broadly speaking, there's underlying demand that we saw, even coming through this period where people were a bit rattled.  With all those headlines you just talked about, including an earthquake, we still saw strong demand.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Very good. Steve, thank you for your questions, and we'll move to the next caller.

The next is Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
On the royalty issue that hit the Q1 gross margins.  Is that expected to carry over to impact Q2 gross margins as well?
Kevin March
Jim, we don't typically forecast on that level, but we think the royalties would probably run in the, call it, the $50 million kind of range on a quarterly basis going forward.
Ron Slaymaker
Which is about where they were in Q1. So probably, just looking forward, we don't really see a big transition. Although, Jim, as you know, royalties can always bounce around based on what happens with our licensees' revenue and things like that. But probably at a level in fourth -- in the first quarter that we would expect roughly to hold through the rest of the year.  Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Yes, please. On the production issues out of Japan.  Is there any risk that some of the share that you were unable to satisfy or some of the shipments you weren't able to satisfy this quarter go elsewhere and are hard to get back? Or do you think you can kind of take them back as you ramp up production in other regions?
Kevin March
Jim, I don't think there's much concern on a share shift standpoint. Again, most of the products are designed in. It's difficult or undesirable for many customers to want to redesign somebody else in. Not impossible, but difficult. This is a short-term interruption, and frankly, we're moving very quickly to qualify products into other factories. So the reaction from our customers has actually been quite good so far. So at this point, I'd minimize any risk to our share position due to the earthquake.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, Jim, I would think of it this way. A customer, if they're -- all the different directions they can put their energies, it's going to be much more expedient for them to work on taking a device that we used to manufacture in Miho and, say, requalify the similar device that we could provide them out of our fab than to go back to the design stage and try to redesign a board to use a competitor's device. And again, very, very few of these devices, if any, would be pin-for-pin compatible with competitor's devices. They are highly proprietary. And so again, what we've seen is and what we've encouraged is a pretty intense effort to work with us on getting the 80% of the devices requalified over into other areas, while at the same time we're doing our best to recover production in Miho as fast as possible as well. Okay. Thank you, Jim, and we'll move to the next caller.

The next is Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Any repercussions for lead times? And not just for your products.  What are you seeing in the industry? Are there any complementary products where lead times are stretching out? And then I had a follow-up as well.
Kevin March
Yes, Ambrish. So clearly, we had to adjust lead times to our customers for deliveries for products that were impacted by -- in the Miho factory. But aside from that, I can't -- I'm not aware of any others to point out.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Okay. And then my follow-up, any buyer's remorse after pulling the National deal?
Ron Slaymaker
Kevin, do you have any remorse to spending $6.5 billion to buy National?
Kevin March
Frankly, I can't -- I'm pretty enthusiastic about us getting that deal closed. When you take a look at the opportunity, we have actually accelerated the growth of the National portfolio. It's pretty exciting. Our incremental cost to accelerate that growth was exactly 0, because we already have a sales force in place. So as soon as we can expose their products to 10 times the size of the sales force, we should expect to see a meaningful shift in a probably short order in the revenue growth of those products.
Ron Slaymaker
I mean, there are just not very many opportunities, Ambrish, to be able to pick up a 12,000-product Analog portfolio and a very high-quality Analog portfolio and basically be able to get it at a reasonable market price such as we were able to with this acquisition. And we've obviously spent a lot of time out meeting with investors. And frankly, the feedback from our largest investors has been very encouraging regarding that acquisition, TI's use of capital for that acquisition and what they believe we'll be able to do with it. So I think they share our enthusiasm for bringing that National team onboard and doing it as quickly as we can. All right. Ambrish Srivastava, thank you for your questions, and we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
The next is Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
In light of that National acquisition and the fact that you're investing, as you pointed out, in field sales and engineering, does that change your dynamic? I know it hasn't closed yet, so you haven't kind of got the green light completely. But why add field sales and engineering when you're bringing on National's sales force and their engineers on top of it? Is the growth opportunity that strong?
Kevin March
Actually, it is, Ed. I mean, we're continuing on our organic growth pursuits that we've had all along. Recall that we spent the last year and a half expanding our manufacturing capacity with the idea of rapidly growing organically our own internal portfolio of some 30,000-odd Analog products. That has not changed, and the expectation for each of those businesses inside our portfolio to have growth rates at running 2x fair market has not changed. And so in order to do that, we continue to want to add people in areas where we see the actual growth opportunity at. The exciting part, again, for us is it's incrementally quite easy for us to add the additional 12,000 products that National's portfolio will bring to us into our sales people's hands and on those same calls now have an even higher probability of walking away with a sale every time they show up with a customer.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, so just to reinforce, because we used to get this question a lot from investors, whether our aggressive growth goals for Analog would be purely met organically or whether we would do it via acquisition. Our goal, in turn, for the organic growth has not changed whatsoever, and that's basically to be growing 2x the market. So we're continuing to execute the strategy to make sure we deliver on that goal, and then what we'll be doing with the National portfolio will certainly be in addition to that. So Ed, do you have a follow-on question?
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Well, I was going to follow-up to that one, but -- so incrementally, I mean, obviously you talked a lot about helping out National by adding so many more sales force to their feet on the street. But then you got the National guys helping you guys out too, and that's incremental to, I guess, what your organic growth would be, then, I expect.
Kevin March
It certainly cuts both ways. I mean, there's a -- great sales people are hard to find, and great FAEs are even harder to find. And we're combining these teams together, and we're pretty encouraged we've already got the largest sales force in the industry and it's going to be even larger. So I think the ability to multiply on that growth standpoint is clearly in our favor.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, and I think, Ed, you're familiar with National, I know, but I forget the exact numbers. Something like 45%, 46% of their recent revenue is coming from the industrial market, and that's a much stronger position in industrial, and a lot of it comes because of the power management capabilities they have for high-voltage type of applications. And so they will have relationships with customers and, certainly, portfolio, what do I call, lead-in type products that we will be able to benefit from with those customers. And hopefully, we'll go in selling microcontrollers, DSPs and other products those customers might be able to take advantage of as well. Okay. Ed, thank you, and we'll move to the next caller.

Next is JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC
Just a little bit more, if we could, on Japan. I'm curious -- you moved, it sounds like, more than you originally planned to other facilities, 80% up from 60%. I'm wondering what percentage of those parts are already qualified, or when do you think they will be qualified?
Kevin March
JoAnne, I think initially, we had indicated that somewhere around 60% or so was available in [ph] other factories, and we've since been able to increase that to about 80%. Qualification is under way for many of those products already. It's really a function from two sides. One, we've got to qualify it inside the factory they're moving those products into. And the second part is the customer has to gain confidence that parts are actually working as they expect them to work. So that's probably going to be taking us through this quarter and maybe even the next quarter on some of these products.
Ron Slaymaker
So just another data point I would add is our fab these days, we have about 100 devices qualified for production there, and we're adding about 10 new devices per week into our fab. If you just go back a month ago before the earthquake or, I guess, a little more than a month, we were probably adding at a pace of about five new devices per week in our fab. And certainly, the acceleration that's happened since then is because of trying to move those Miho products and provide some production alternatives there. Do you have a follow-on, JoAnne?
JoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC
Yes. On the composition side, you've had a month or so to look at this. I'm wondering how the composition of your existing inventories matches up against the shortfall out of the Miho facility, whether you'll be able to draw down inventories to meet customer demand or whether there isn't a particularly good match there in the inventory sets?
Kevin March
There was already material that Miho had produced that was in our assembly test sites. We had some finished good materials as well. We had a better recovery of wafers than we initially anticipated after the earthquake. We thought more were damaged than we had actually believed to be the case initially. So between those, we've got some inventory to be able to handle our customer demands, but clearly not enough, which is why we are re-qual-ing many of those products into other factories. And it's also why we had to re-profile the lead times on those particular parts, because we don't have enough material on hand to meet the demands of those customers.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you, JoAnne. We'll move to the next caller.
Operator
The next is Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
I know you probably can't answer this definitively, but how confident do you feel that you're incorporating most, if not all, of the impact from Japan? And in that vein, are you incorporating any impact from any sort of demand disruption from Japan domestically?
Kevin March
Chris, right now, we've given you our best estimate, which we think is -- with what we know today, an all-in number, if you will, that is we think about $0.05 impact in the second quarter. As we get further and further into bringing equipment up and actually making sure that they function as intended, that may change. But right now, we think that's a good number. The kind of knock-on effect I alluded to in my opening remarks, and that is given that our revenue grows sequentially in the quarter, we expect to be about half of what we would normally experience on a seasonal basis. If we run the math on that, we think that that's about another $0.05 of earnings foregone from a revenue standpoint in the quarter. So between the foregone earnings of $0.05 and the actual expected increase in recovery costs of $0.05, it looks out to be about a $0.10 impact in the second quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Yes. Do you guys expect any sort of makeup in the second half, especially on the gross margin side? In terms of modeling, should we assume that once you get back to the revenue levels you had last year, your gross margins will be the same or similar?
Kevin March
Yes, Chris, we'll just remind you, again, that $0.05 that I've talked about for second quarter costs will pretty much all go through cost of revenue, so that will have a negative impact on our gross margins. But to the extent that, that pretty much wraps up the repair cost and the recovery costs, we should expect to see our gross margins begin to move back to the levels that you grew accustomed seeing us at, at those revenue levels.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you, Chris. Let's move to the next caller.
Operator
Next is Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
First question, your guidance range is fairly wide, up one to nine. And I was just wondering if the variables there are simply Japan, or is there anything else that's behind that range?
Kevin March
Tore, I believe that range is very consistent with what you've seen from TI historically. We usually start with a range at that level and then try to narrow it as we move into the mid-quarter update. But this is consistent with what we've historically provided at the beginning of the quarter.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, very good. And can you also clarify a little bit more what's happening in distribution channel? I think you said sell-through was very strong, TI inventory was down, yet you've done a good job to sort of get the inventories back up. So what exactly is happening there? I mean, are distributors wanting to build more inventory? Or -- just trying to understand it better.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I think -- well, sell-through was strong, and frankly, we had expected it to be strong, coming into the quarter. Now it's certainly part of the characterization we gave back in January that we thought we were coming into an above-seasonal first quarter. And you only have to go back to their, those distributors' reports, where they were talking about order strength and fourth quarter positive book-to-bills to come away with that type of consideration. I would say that inventory is about where they would like to have it, and frankly, where we would like to have them. As we mentioned, days were down a few. But basically, in the six-week range for their inventory, that's about where they have historically been, especially if you make adjustments for the increasing amount of distributor inventory that we're carrying on consignment programs. So consignment moved up a little bit. About a third of our distribution revenue is now being supported on consignment programs. And as that continues to move up -- and by the way, we will also, as we bring that National portfolio onboard, we will move that into consignment programs with distribution as well. But as the percentage of our distribution support that is supported by consignment inventory moves up, then naturally the amount of inventory that the distributors need to carry would move down correspondingly. So -- but again, I would say they're generally right in the range where they would like to be. Okay. Tore, I believe that's two questions. So we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
We go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
Just a question on calculators versus your regular semiconductor business. That's usually up, the Calculator side, in the second quarter. Any reason, Japan or otherwise, that, that wouldn't constitute the usual two to three points of sequential growth?
Ron Slaymaker
No, I think you got it right, Ross. If you look at Calculators from first to second quarter, very typical would be a doubling of their revenue. And there's no reason where we wouldn't expect that same. So that could be 2.5 to 3 points of company-level revenue growth first to second quarter coming from that seasonal lift in Calculator demand. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
Yes, different topic, though. On OpEx, your OpEx went up about $36 million sequentially. You mentioned about the investments in Embedded and Analog. Is that the majority of that $36 million, and should we think about that sort of magnitude going forward as you continue to invest? Or were there onetime things in that sequential comparison that won't occur again as we go forward?
Kevin March
Ross, the only onetime thing, just to point back to, we do, do our annual pay and benefits increases in the first quarter. So there's about 2/3 of a quarter's worth of that in there. So you'll see a bit more of that as we go into next quarter as we get a full-quarter effect of that. Plus, back to your earlier question about calculators and so on, from a seasonality standpoint, we typically see our SG&A go up a bit there on marketing cost. So you'll typically see our OpEx move up in the second quarter. I think last year, if you go take a look at that, it's a good way to think about how this year might play out as well.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, and the only other point I would make, Ross, is we provided annual -- we don't do it for SG&A, but for R&D guidance of $1.7 billion. Now certainly, that could round up or round down to that number, but that's -- that will give you also some rough guidelines on that. Okay. Thank you, Ross, and we'll move to the next caller.
Operator
The next is Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company
Kevin, any thoughts on the amount of debt that you're comfortable taking on associated with the National deal?
Kevin March
Yes, Craig, we talked about we would probably issue somewhere between $3 billion and $4 billion of debt as part of that acquisition, and I don't have any more updates for you on that. I still think that's probably a good number to frame for modeling purposes.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Craig?
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company
Yes, just you talked about lead times, pretty clear message there. As you look at pricing dynamics, especially in High-Volume Analog and Power Management, any change to pricing over the last month or two, especially since the quake?
Ron Slaymaker
Craig, pricing pretty much across the board is trending normally. So I don't think we've seen anything that we would say is, first of all, abnormal to begin with, much less that we would correlate to the quake. Okay. Craig, thank you for your questions. We'll move to the next caller.
Operator
The next is Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated
Could you give us an update on the market share you believe you had with OMAP 4? And in terms of the market share gains that you expect over the next few quarters, is that relative to previous OMAP products?  Or is it relative to the competition? And if so, why do you say you were getting share in that space?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. So I don't have a share number for you, specifically. But there's probably lots of third-party people that make their living at trying to make that assessment. So I guess I would just reference you in that direction. In terms of gains that we're making and what gives us confidence that we will see share gains, it's as simple as looking at the pipeline of wins that we have under way. And to some degree, Tristan, it depends upon how you define the market, and I don't mean that cute. What I mean, though, is that our view of mobile computing and the opportunity there is a pretty broad definition of the opportunities. So it includes tablets and it includes smartphones, but it also includes areas like data terminals. The guys in the brown truck that deliver the package to you that pull a little data terminal out and record the delivery and has you sign on the pad, we view that as an OMAP, a potential OMAP application. In fact, we have wins in that space. So again, a very broad definition of the opportunity for mobile computing, and by no means does that diminish our enthusiasm for OMAP in smartphones and in tablets. In fact, I would say both of those are must-win areas, but we also have a much broader definition where we're going to be able to take that same OMAP technology and put it into a lot of different areas: eReaders, personal navigation devices I mentioned previously are all areas where today, we have OMAP design wins in that pipeline that I'm referring to that these aren't demo projects that somebody did at a trade show. These are production programs that we have in development for customers that will be going into production in 2011. And so there's always uncertainty as to how much success a particular product will have out in the marketplace. But in terms of the quality of the customers, the size of the potential opportunities, we are quite confident that it's going to translate to very solid market share gains for us in that market. Do you have a follow-on, Tristan?
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated
Quick follow-up on that, the production for RFAB, any type of guidance in terms of production we could expect from RFAB by end of this year? And also, how would that compare with the peak potential output from that same fab?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Tristan, what I would say today is the revenue amount coming out of RFAB is still relatively small. We've said all along that we are capable today from an equipment perspective of ramping RFAB up into about a $2 billion production level and that we will pace that based upon market demand. Certainly, events such as we've had in Japan have resulted in somewhat of an acceleration there. But I don't have a specific number to be able to say we'll be at this dollar value or this percent utilization, other than it's ramping nicely, maybe even ahead of plan, based on the added motivation of getting those Miho devices qualified over there.
Operator
We'll go next to Ramesh Misra with Brigantine Advisors.
Ramesh Misra - Brigantine Advisors LLC
Thanks for squeezing me in. Ron, very roughly, what was your percentage of revenue from Japan? And longer term, do you expect that to change? So in other words, are you seeing customers in Japan looking to diversify their supplier base from being heavily Japan-centric to something that's a little more balanced?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Our percent of revenue from Japan last year was about 10%. And to the question of are we look -- do we believe customers will look for more diversified supplier base?  I don't believe so. I think our -- I mean, I shouldn't say I don't believe so. What I mean is, I think that it's way too early for customers to be going through that. They're focused on bringing their factories back into operation in that earthquake zone. I don't think at this point they're trying to figure out whether they should be there or whether they should be someplace else. That can happen and probably very likely could happen later, but I haven't heard of a customer reevaluating their location status.
Kevin March
I would just point out also that the output from Miho is not just sold into Japan, it is sold around the world. So it's -- there's not a direct connection between Miho or Aizu factories and the actual revenue that we gain in Japan.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, one thing I'll mention as a longer term benefit for TI is it's always -- there's cost to our customers, there's distractions to our customers to requalify our product from one fab to another fab. But as we've said before, because of the supply disruption out of Miho, there has been an intensified effort on behalf of the customers to go ahead and help us internally multi-source those products into other fabs. And that's something that, just from an operational and logistics perspective, we'll benefit from over time. Having the same devices in production at multiple fabs and having those customer qualifications already in place just always provides us a different level of flexibility. Okay. Ramesh, do you have a follow-on question?
Ramesh Misra - Brigantine Advisors LLC
Okay. That is helpful. Very quick one. On your mid-quarter update, you had said that you felt that the PC business had bottomed and begun to rebound. Are you still seeing that, I guess, broader PC including the mobile?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, Ramesh, that, in fact, is correct. I think what we said was earlier in the quarter, because there had been a chipset recall, we had seen disruption in that business, but that as we moved later into February, as that other supplier basically got back online and moved forward, we had seen, even at the mid-quarter update, recovery in our PC-related business. I would say that did continue through the month of March. So that business is continuing well at this point. 
Okay. And with that, we'll wrap up. Thank you for joining as. A replay of this call is available on our website, and good evening.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter and Year End 2010 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year 2010 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web. 
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for March 8. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update. 
In today's call, we'll describe our views on the demand environment, where we are in the correction and our near-term outlook. We'll also talk about the financial impact of the three new factories that we have now brought online and the opportunities for growth that these factories provide. Finally, we'll provide a retrospective view of the year and our expectations for the years ahead. 
I'll start with the demand environment. As a reminder, from the second quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2010, the SC industry had six quarters of strong growth. Our own revenue in the third quarter of 2010 was up 79% from the first quarter 2009 trough. In the summer of 2010, the industry began to slow and then declined in the fourth quarter. During our October and December calls, we said that we believed the slowdown would be both short and shallow. We were in an environment where lead times were shortening and inventories were being quickly reduced. At this point, we believe the correction is mostly complete. 
TI's lead times have now completed an orderly reduction and are back to normal as we had projected in our last call. During the fourth quarter, we were able to replenish our inventory levels, which will help us keep lead times normal during 2011. 
Regarding customer and channel inventory, while there are some customer-specific examples where inventories are higher than they desire, we see some of the important end markets like PCs and LCD TVs having largely completed their inventory corrections. In the PC market, TI revenue from battery management products bottomed early in the fourth quarter and grew through the remainder of the quarter. 
In the LCD TV market, our customers tell us that their excess inventory was significantly cleared in the fourth quarter and to expect higher demand in the current quarter, as a result, even though new orders for the quarter were down again from the third quarter.  After a very weak month of October, net orders were appreciably higher during the month of November and December. 
Let me translate all of this to our outlook. Historically, the first quarter for TI would be down about 5% compared with the fourth quarter. The middle of our current first quarter guidance range is a little better than seasonal. In addition, our backlog coverage as we enter the current first quarter was higher than recent years of history for our first quarter. To summarize the demand environment, we believe the slowdown that started in the summer of 2010 is mostly complete. 
Turning to our fourth quarter results, revenue in the fourth quarter was slightly better than the middle of our range of expectations. Revenue declined 6% sequentially and was up 17% from a year ago. Analog revenues declined 4% sequentially and grew 20% from a year ago. The sequential decline was primarily due to Power Management products given their higher exposure to the PC market. High Volume Analog and Logic products and High-Performance Analog products declined to a lesser extent. The 20% increase in Analog revenue from a year ago was mostly due to strength in High-Performance Analog products, although HVAL and Power Management both had double-digit growth. 
In Embedded Processing, revenue declined 7% sequentially and grew 31% from a year ago. The sequential decline was due to lower catalog product revenue, with revenue from products sold into communications infrastructure and automotive applications about even. The 31% increase from a year ago was primarily due to catalog products. Communications infrastructure revenue also grew, and in fact, its growth rate exceeded 30%. Growth from products sold into automotive applications was lower, although still double digits. Total wireless revenue was about even sequentially and from a year ago. 
Baseband revenue was $435 million in the quarter, down slightly from $438 million in the prior quarter and down from $465 million a year ago. Sequential growth in the OMAP applications processor revenue was offset by lower connectivity revenue and a slightly lower Baseband revenue. From a year ago, higher connectivity and applications processor revenue was offset by the lower Baseband revenue. In our Other segment, revenue declined 14% sequentially and grew 23% from a year ago. Most of the sequential decline was the result of the seasonal decline in calculators. DLP revenues declined by about the same amount as revenue from our transitional supply agreements increased. 
As a reminder, when we recently acquired our Aizu Japan and Chengdu China fabs, we agreed to continue to supply Spansion and SMIC with products from those factories on a transitional basis while we ramp our own productions in those facilities. The financial impact of these agreements should largely offset any carrying costs associated with those new factories and will be reflected as part of our Other segment. The 23% growth in the Other segment from a year ago was due to a combination of these transitional supply agreements, higher custom ASIC revenue and higher DLP product revenue. I should also note that the gain on our sale of a product line is included in the result of the Other segment. 
Distribution resales declined 4% compared with the prior quarter, not much different than our overall semiconductor revenue trend. We were able to help distributors replenish a few days of inventory in the quarter, helping to position down for expected growth. 
Shifting briefly to our full-year 2010 results, TI revenue grew 34% in total. Each of our core businesses contributed strongly to this growth, with each area growing in excess of 40%. Analog revenue grew 42%, with strong growth in HVAL, Power Management, and HPA. Embedded Processing grew 41%, led by especially strong growth in catalog products. 
In both Analog and Embedded Processing, we continued to benefit from the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, combined with the significant scale advantage that our field sales and applications force provides us. This means we have the ability to call on more customers and engage with them more deeply compared with our competitors. We believe the share gains we earned in 2010 were largely results of this. 
In Wireless, the combination of applications processors and connectivity products grew slightly more than 40%. Wireless Baseband revenue was $1.7 billion in 2010, essentially unchanged from 2009. As a percent of total TI revenue, Baseband declined from 17% of TI in 2009 to 12% of revenue in 2010. We continue to be encouraged by our strong design position and momentum in OMAP applications processors. With our dual core OMAP 4 applications processor generation, we have a combination of low power and high performance that we believe is unmatched in the industry. We are now in volume production of our first OMAP 4 device. 
We are deeply engaged in collaborating with multiple customers on tablet programs that reach across TI product lines, including OMAP 4 applications processors, single-chip wireless connectivity solutions that integrate four radio technologies: WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth and FM, and Analog Power Management technologies that optimize overall power distribution and consumption within the tablet. There are a host of other examples of OMAP's broadening design in success, including eReaders, personal navigation devices, portable data terminals and many other devices that can leverage OMAP's combination of high performance and low power. Now, Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Ron and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial performance this quarter again illustrates the benefit of our transformation to a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing and our associated manufacturing strategy. We've discussed for sometime that the additional manufacturing assets that we acquired over the past 15 months would have minimal negative impact on TI's financials because of the low prices that we paid for this equipment. 
In the fourth quarter, we ramped production at three new factories. RFAB, on 300mm Analog fab located in Richardson, Texas, the Aizu Japan fab that we acquired from Spansion Japan; and the Chengdu China fab that was previously operated by SMIC. As a result, this was the first all in quarter from a financial perspective and we are now depreciating all these acquired assets. While we're now carrying the full weight of this depreciation, loadings of TI products at these factories are still low given the early stages of our production ramp. These factories provide us with tremendous headroom for growth, more than $4.5 billion in total additional revenue. As we load them with TI analog products, the profit potential is significant. 
As you might expect, TI factory utilization was down in the fourth quarter, impacting gross margin. This was only partly the result of new capacity additions. It is also due to our lowering of production loadings in our other factories in response to the weaker demand environment. In other words, we had three variables influencing gross margin in the quarter. 
On the negative side, we had higher costs from new factories and we had lower utilization in our existing factories as the market slowed. On the positive side, we were able to make nice strides replenishing inventory for those products whose lead times had been extended for much of the past year, largely returning those products to move to normal lead times. Given these cross currents, we're pleased with how our gross margin performed in the quarter. In total, gross profit fell 8% sequentially and our gross margin declined 150 basis points to 53% of revenue. 
Turning to our other financials, the combination of R&D and SG&A decreased $26 million in the third quarter. We had a gain on the sale of a product line of $144 million in the quarter. Operating profit for the quarter was $1.23 billion or 34.9% of revenue. Without the gain on sale, operating margin was 30.8% of revenue. Net income in the fourth quarter was $942 million or $0.78 per share. In the earnings per share calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units in which we pay dividend equivalents. 
In the fourth quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $14 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have reported. As you'll note in the release, earnings per share included $0.14 from the combination of the gain on the sale of a product line and a tax benefit that was primarily associated with the restatement of the federal R&D tax credit that was retroactive back at the beginning of 2010. I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. 
However, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $1.23 billion. This was down $88 million in the last quarter, and up $230 million from a year ago. Capital expenditures declined to $301 million in the quarter and included additions to our assembly and test capacity, as well as our Analog wafer fab capacity. We used $600 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase 19.5 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $153 million. We increased our inventory by $96 million in the quarter and inventory days to 83. With this inventory position, we have returned lead times to normal levels. Orders in the quarter declined to $3.13 billion. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 0.89 the quarter. Orders bottomed in the month of October, with November and December orders appreciably above that level. 
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.27 billion to $3.55 billion in the first quarter or down 7% to up 1% sequentially. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.62. Our estimate for 2011 R&D is $1.7 billion. 2011 capital expenditures and depreciation are expected to be about $900 million each. Our estimate for our 2011 effective tax rate is 30%. Please note that our estimates for 2011 depreciation is approximately the same as we had in 2010. As I described in October, the additional depreciation associated with our acquired manufacturing assets will be mostly offset by the roll off of depreciation from capital expenditures five years ago. Needless to say, even though our fixed cost in the form of depreciation will be essentially unchanged, our ability to grow and to respond to customer demand will be much higher. 
Before I wrap up, I'm going to make some brief comments about 2010 overall. It was a good year for TI and our shareholders, with strong 34% revenue growth, gross margins have expanded 570 basis points to 53.6% of revenue and operating margins that moved up 1,320 basis points to 32.3% of revenues. We didn't just ride the rising tide of a growing semiconductor market. We believe we also gained significant market share overall, as well as in each of our core businesses. We've described to you for sometime the potential that we believe exists in a transformed TI and I believe 2010 provided a glimpse into that potential. 
Our challenge going forward is to demonstrate that 2010 wasn't a one-off year. We must prove that we can continue to grow our Analog and Embedded Processing revenues significantly faster than those markets. We need to expand our wireless connectivity and applications to process server positions in the smartphone market, as well as in tablets. And we needed to continue to manage our Baseband business for maximum cash flow while it continues to become a smaller part of our company. 
If we do these things right, our shareholders have also continued to benefit. For example, in 2010 alone, our Return On Invested Capital was 30.7% and we generated $3.82 billion of cash from operations. This allowed us to repurchase $2.5 billion of our stock and pay dividends of almost $600 million. Combined, these cash returns to our shareholders amounted to about 10% of our initial market capitalization when we entered the year.
Key to all this is that our Analog and Embedded Processing products are highly differentiated and not dependent upon the latest manufacturing technologies. Therefore, our capital requirements are relatively low. High differentiation and low capital requirements allow us to be more profitable and we don't have to channel all of our profits back into the manufacturing operations. As a result, we expect to continue to be able to provide significant returns to our shareholders in the years ahead. With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions]

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
You talked a little bit about the bookings trends in November and December. Could you just talk a little bit about what you've seen so far this quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
I won't break it down week by week, Tore but I will say that everything that we've seen both on the order front, as well as shipments or revenue has been strong thus far in the quarter. So we've seen nothing thus far that would discourage us at all from the outlook that we've provided.
Kevin March
Let me just add to that, if I can. Our backlog coming into the quarter was actually higher than we've seen from first quarter over the last few years, which gives further confidence to the outlook that we're providing.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
And I realize you were to able to build a little bit of inventory in Q4. What's your inventory plan for the March quarter?
Kevin March
Specifically on the inventory plans per se, but we do expect to continue to build inventory on those parts that have high demand that we want to keep short lead times on. And clearly, the shape of the 2Q demand will dictate just how much inventory we try to position if we go through the quarter.
Ron Slaymaker
But keep in mind, Tore the other factor, even though we have a plan to build inventory, depending upon where we land in that revenue range, that could impact our inventory expectations or actuals as well.
Operator
We'll go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Let me just start by off by asking in terms of where you've seen bookings improvement. So you called out the books, you also talked about LCD TV. I just want to understand whether you've also seen that from distributors as well? So if you are able to kind of walk through by end market, however you can just give us a sense of where bookings are coming from?
Ron Slaymaker
I guess I would say it is reasonably broad-based now. Again, the overall trend was down. But we specifically called out what we were seeing in PCs and some of the HDTV space because those were areas that in prior calls, we had noted that there was inventory correction underway in those areas were particularly weak. To hit on distribution, I think I said in the prepared remarks that our distribution resales were down about 4% sequentially. I think I noted that we were able to help distributors build a few days of inventory. But I would say their inventory levels are at very comfortable levels from an absolute standpoint. They're just over six weeks of inventory currently. And if you look at historical levels, we've seen them generally in the eight to nine weeks. Now, you probably need to adjust that for about 30% of our distribution revenue that we now support with consignment. But even with that adjustment, certainly inventories are at very, I'd call, normal or typical levels compared to history and at a comfortable level based on what the distributors are expecting in terms of their future resale demand.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Can I just ask you about OMAP 4? You've talked about a prospect for OMAP 4 but one wouldn't help but notice that your OMAP 3 was designed out from one of your large customers. I just want to kind of get a sense of how we should be confident about the prospects of OMAP 4, especially as you see more and more competition there, get more tablets based. Are there any comments you can make there? And also, just types to clarify your stance on the tablet market with OMAP 4.
Ron Slaymaker
Did you mention a specific competitor in the tablets space?
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
That's right. We've seen [indiscernible] get very aggressive. We've heard comments about how much share of gains within the tablet market. And that's been probably the one product; one of shipping now is tablets that we know. So I just want to see now what makes you comfortable about OMAP 4 prospects in the light of all the competitions resting in the system.
Ron Slaymaker
What makes us comfortable are the designs programs we have underway and design programs that are specifically slated to go into production. Let me just say these are not long-term development programs. These are programs that are going to result in relatively near-term revenue. The competitor you referred to, NVIDIA, to their credit, was the first out with a dual core applications processor. I believe they had a couple of months, maybe a quarter lead on our OMAP 4 product. OMAP 4 began sampling fourth quarter a year ago. So we've had that product in customers' hands for over a year at this point. We're well along in development program. And again, them being first for customers that are trying to get out with tablet programs, right away, especially some that are based upon the Android operating system, they're the player, they were the first player out so there is a natural alignment there. But I guess what I would say is we fully are comfortable that we will be there as these programs hit stride and ramp into real volume. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are in volume production now with OMAP 4. And we're not just in production to put those products in inventories. In fact, we're shipping to a customer that plans to ramp their tablet production based on OMAP 4. So again, we've acknowledged for a long time the tablet market, as is the smartphone market will be a competitive market. But I think you're going to find that translates to great opportunity for TI across a variety of product areas.
Operator
We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
First question, this quarter is a little bit unusual from the standpoint of your competitors are saying different things about their own lead times. Some say they're all the way back down to normal, consistent with what you're saying. Others are suggesting their own lead times are still elevated. Do you have any sense that you can give us for sort of industry average with the combination of some competitors still being extended and others still being all the way back down?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, I agree completely with what you're describing, that I actually think different competitors are at different points. I know even last week, I was listening to a call where a competitor, a very credible competitor was talking about their lead times have progressed but they still remain extended, we'll take more time. I think the best thing I can say about our own situation is I believe we got on top of the situation earlier in terms of capacity investments and we brought that capacity online. And that's what translated to lead time reduction for us. I think you can always have demand fix your lead times. If it turns down enough, I think if anything for us, this respite in demand we've had over the last couple of quarters really just allowed us to get the capacity investments that we have been making, get it online, get some inventory in place and get our lead times back to normal. I think the other thing that's going to be important is depending upon what happens with growth in our industry, in 2011. I think we feel completely comfortable with the headroom that we have on our capacity now that will allow us to grow quite aggressively, if that's what the market wants to do. And at the same time, maintain our lead times where we and our customers want them to be. I think you'll find if we get into some heady growth in 2011, a lot of our competitors that have not made capacity investments and maybe lead times have adjusted maybe more recently because of slower demand environment over the last quarter, I suspect you'll find them in a different situation with their lead time trends in that kind of environment.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
If I could ask specifically about how you feel that your position within power management in the tablet space? I know another one of your competitors have referenced the fact that they lost the socket, the power management socket, in the tablet and I know everybody's trying to figure out who potentially gained that socket and I wondered how well positioned you think you are in that space?
Ron Slaymaker
There's a broad question and there's an implied question. Let me answer the broad question, which is I think we are very well positioned in the tablet with our power management. And you know well, we're well-positioned overall in the marketplace with power management but certainly, tablets are a targeted area for us across a number of product lines just because that's a new emerging space with a lot of opportunities. In fact, maybe I can even diverge for a second and talk about that opportunity overall. I'll stay away from the implied question, which was... were we the player that picked up their lost socket? But I will say we're well-positioned and we think there's a lot of opportunity. Let me maybe just kind of walk through a little bit our view of the tablet opportunity for TI. I know there's a lot of dialogue amongst analysts and investors on how big is that opportunity and how does it compare to a PC. For us, we believe there's over $30 of content opportunity in a tablet. And that goes across Analog, OMAP and wireless connectivity. And kind of the break out of that is the Analog content alone is over $10. The OMAP content, the apps processor opportunity is in the $15 range and then there's probably an additional $3 to $5 of content opportunity for connectivity. By no means do we have all of that in each system. In some cases, we are playing on Analog and maybe not on OMAP. But certainly, that's the opportunity. If I compare that opportunity to a PC for TI, I'd say the biggest difference is that in a PC, the processor, as well as most of the connectivity value really is dominated by a single player. And that's not an opportunity for TI. Of course, unlike a tablet, a PC includes a hard disk drive where we would have probably $1 to $2 of content per system on average. But the net difference between that PC opportunity and a tablet really represents a very significant opportunity for TI. The breadth of our portfolio across Analog, OMAP and connectivity, I'll just say gives us a tremendous opportunity to carve out what could be a very, very significant piece of this important emerging market and we plan to make the most of it.
Operator
We'll go next to Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
On the gross margins, can you give us a flavor of the moving parts to go into Q1 and Q2 as it relates to your business and more particularly your utilization rates? Do you expect them to decline again in Q1?
Kevin March
Shawn, in the first quarter, I already mentioned that we felt the full effect of bringing three new factories online. So that clearly had an impact on us. The utilization in the fourth quarter was actually down quite a few points. And that wasn't all just attributable to the new factories. We consciously slowed down production in our remaining factories, with the exception of those products where we had extended lead times. We continue to build inventory on those products alone in order to get lead times back to normal. So, while we bring it on the new factories and define overall utilization, the weight in our margins in the fourth quarter. Going in the first quarter, we expect utilization maybe up another point or two, not significantly, but up a little bit and really will be a function of both how demand shapes up in the first quarter and more importantly, how our outlook begins to shape up for second quarter and beyond so we can have inventory ready on time to maintain the achievement we've had on bringing lead times in.
Ron Slaymaker
Just to ask and clarify Kevin, so the new factories that were being already accounted for in the fourth quarter for the most part, all the assets that we had previously acquired from Qimonda, Spansion and the China fab that was all in. There's not another chunk to come along in the first quarter, correct?
Kevin March
There's not another chunk to come along, it is all in. In fact one of the best ways you could see that is look on our cash flow statement and look at the depreciation line. You will see a step up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. If you just multiply that times four, it's consistent with our $900 million depreciation we have for 2011.
Ron Slaymaker
So fourth quarter was already at the 2011 depreciation run rate.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
So on lead times, are there any other areas where your product lead times are still the tightest or are actually going out in Q1? And you mentioned your end markets that were good. Are there any specific end markets that are still soft or you expect the weakest sequential growth in Q1?
Kevin March
On lead times, the overwhelming majority of products are back to a normal lead time. There are still some exceptions but there always is in a normal industry cycle anyway. There are some parts where we'd prefer to have shorter lead times and some customers would prefer that also, but that now the minority of parts as opposed to the majority. Most of that is just fine. We expect now that we've gotten lead times largely caught up, we'll continue to use a relatively seasonal down period in the first quarter to make sure that we've got much more attractive lead times in the event that 2011 becomes a stronger year as Ron was talking about earlier so we can maintain what we've got in there.
Operator
We will go next to Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
So you mentioned that the inventory correction looks to be over in certain parts but maybe not over in other parts. Can you just talk about the various end markets and what stages you see them being at vis-a-vis, any sort of inventory issue? And I guess maybe throw in your expectations for the end markets this quarter and the rest of the year?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, let me take a stab at it and Kevin may have a few comments to make. We're not going to be able to walk through market by market. I think what we have tried to do is identify in the few areas that we specifically have previously noted the inventory correction was the most significant. We've tried to provide some guidance or perspective that we think that inventory correction is largely complete. If you go more broadly, there are some customers that probably are totally clean. There are other customers that would not be in similar situation or still have more to go in terms of cleaning up inventory. And now, it will vary customer by customers, maybe somewhat market by market but probably more customer by customer. I don't know that we're really going to do us a lot of benefit to walk through each of those other than what you may gain from listening and talking to those customers directly as they report their own result.
Kevin March
I think that's right. Just to reemphasize on what Ron opened with though, the PC space we saw at least for our battery management products bottomed in the beginning of the fourth quarter and grew steadily through the balance of the quarter. TV space seemed to have bottomed out in the quarter. And indications from our customers that their inventories are largely cleared and we can expect resumptions of orders in the first quarter. We talked about communications infrastructure continuing to be solid in the quarter, automotive being recently solid. Smartphones are actually quite strong and with the adoption rates, consumer level around the world, one would expect that, that would probably be -- continue to be quite strong going into 2011. And then the industrial space, we had talked about 90 days ago that industrial had been enjoying quite a few quarters of very strong growth led by inventory replenishment, as well as just in demand growth and then we expected that, that growth rate will probably slow down in the fourth quarter and in fact, it did. It slowed down to just in demand kind of growth and we expect that to be the norm going forward.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
So in 2010, your Analog, Embedded and other businesses all grew roughly the same within a few points of each other. Can you give us your sense of relative to your overall TI revenue growth, where you would expect those three product regions to grow?
Kevin March
Chris, I'll just remind you that our objective that we talked about is growing those core areas in their respective markets. And in fact, we did that this past year. They've done enough in a couple of years if you take a look at them. The total company grew at 34% and the core areas grew at 40% plus, a little over 40% for the non-baseband wireless, about 42% for Embedded processing and 43% for Analog. So, clearly very strong growth rates and a lot of momentum given the scale of sales force and the scale of the portfolio, plus more recently the scale of our manufacturing capabilities. Our ability to outgrow our competitors certainly seems to be more highly probable today than you might have thought a couple of years ago, especially in light of the observation that Ron made earlier. And that is, we did take action in late 2009 and especially 2010 to increase our manufacturing capacity, which allowed us to begin bringing our lead times in many cases before quite a few of our competitors could. Many of our competitors would not necessarily take similar actions and should we have a resumption of growth as we go into second quarter and beyond, it could be difficult for some of them to respond to customer demand, which increases the probability again that we will outgrow our marketplace in 2011.
Kevin March
And Chris, as I know you're well aware but just as a reminder for broader audience, there is Baseband revenue that will decline over the next couple of years. And that's 12% of our revenue both fourth quarter, as well as for the year. I found it interesting that even though it didn't contribute to company growth at an absolute level it held those dollars, Baseband dollars, held relatively stable from '09 to 2010.  Yet, as a percentage of revenue, it continues to decline, it continues to I would say it as be less important to us and less impactful to us. So that will continue to wind down and certainly, not provide the growth contribution that the core areas will. And just to give you a sort of a refresh on the numbers, the baseband revenue is over 90%, 3G, this point, if you compare that to a year ago. It was 66% 3G. So what you've seen is both as the non-3G market has not shown a lot of growth and to some degree as our customers brought on alternative suppliers in the non-3G technologies, that is now a minimal part of our revenue base. Sometime this year, they'll have a supplier for 3G on Baseband. And you can expect at that time then, incursion or degradation in that 3G revenue for TI. But just stay in tune what their alternative suppliers and what that customer says as to the timing of when that will be. It's not right now, is what I would say.
Operator
We'll go next to Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Ron or Kevin, maybe just a clarification from an earlier question but in a circumstance where we're kind of an average growth year call it a 5% to 10% for the industry, do you feel that the capacity you've added is going to be a competitive advantage? Or another way of asking the same question is do you think of the industry absent your capacity is going to be relatively tight and really by adding capacity the way you have, you can therefore take market share? And that's sort of in an average growth curve?
Kevin March
Glen, if we just kind of take a look again at the capacity of the industry, you're well aware that with the onset of the downturn after the third quarter of '08, something in the order of 17% of available capacity was taken off-line and pretty much permanently off-line. Since then, there's been some capacity added but the last reports I saw suggested that total industry capacity, and I'm not including memory in that statement is somewhere around 90% of where it was in the third quarter of '08. I would just say that we're still under capacitized given demand if you will because the total market is now back above where it was in third quarter '08. So even if you just have an average kind of growth rate like you're describing, it would certainly seem that the market is going to be very stressed on capacity going into 2011 and competitors who have not thought ahead to put capacity in place and they find that rather difficult to deal with. What we find particularly attractive again is that the capacity that we have brought online has been at price points, cost points that we simply have not seen in the past. So if it turns out to be a slow growth year, it's not going to have much impact financially on a negative standpoint. If it turns out to be or strong growth year, we should be able to convert that into very profitable revenue at a rate beyond what our competitors can manage.
Ron Slaymaker
And Glen, I'll just also note rhetorically, when was the last time our industry has growth at an average growth rate? Usually, it's very aggressive or in decline, you know that as well as any of us.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
You talk about OMAP 4, which is a dual core solution today. Can you talk about your plans if you have any for a quad core solution and as part of that, can you address whether or not you think that's even a relevant architecture to have in today's market?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't know. I think if you look at the one, call it the next-generation core, I don't think we specifically announced that we're using it for OMAP. But then again maybe we did. We've licensed in fact, I think we were the initial licensee from ARM for their Eagle Core. So I don't know that necessarily we go a key player in additional parallel courses as maybe moved to higher performance directions such as Eagle. But I guess we always have that flexibility.
Operator
We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James & Associates
I'm not sure if you discussed it but can you talk about if your mix of Analog between high-volume, power and high-performance remain roughly the same, percentage wise, as you sort of discussed in the past?
Ron Slaymaker
Steve, it actually has. When we looked at how 2010 landed overall versus 2009, you might recall in 2009, we've described that breakout, 40% HVAL and then 30% each High Performance Analog and Power. And the good news is and frankly, what we had tried to set as expectations was we thought we were at a point where we would have HVAL contributing at about the same pace as those others. So that makes an impact, that happens and the mix did not change 2010 compared to 2009. So again, further reinforcement of a lot of the work that we have done to have HVAL become a major contributor to our growth in fact has followed through to reality.
Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James & Associates
With regard to HVAL, as you mentioned, you put a lot of work into that. I know you have a number of wins. You've taken some technology transferred to other areas. Does that suggest as we go through 2011, HVAL will now perhaps outgrow the other categories?
Ron Slaymaker
I don't know that we would expect it to outgrow the other categories. I think our expectations, and this is not a 2011 statement, it's a longer-term statement, our expectation is that the opportunity and our growth should be pretty well balanced across power, HPA and HVAL. So that's probably as specific as I'd like to be at this point.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
Kind of a question that followed on from Chris' question earlier, rather than by end market, if you talked about your better than seasonal guide by the four product segments you have, are there any big outliers in what's being better than seasonal, worse than seasonal or right at seasonal?
Kevin March
Ross, I don't think there's anything really specific to point at. Part of it is that we had a slightly below seasonal fourth quarter and so that's down looks the other way when you go into first quarter. But again beyond that what we had dragging on us was that PC and consumer space and with the TV space in the fourth quarter. As we indicated, we now are seeing PC begin to pick back up and indications from our TV customers is that the TV, people that we supply, is that we would expect to see a resumption of orders in the first quarter. Beyond that, there's not any one place that I would additional color to.
Ron Slaymaker
And Ross, as you understand probably, we try not to take our forecast or outlook and break it down by individual segments or product lines. But we probably will -- probably serve us well to stay with that approach.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG
The TV and PC together, what that represents as a percentage of sales? Then the real follow up, on OpEx, it dropped nicely in the fourth quarter. I know you give full-year guidance to R&D, but what are the puts and takes for OpEx in the first quarter specifically?
Kevin March
Ross, the OpEx was down in the fourth quarter and that's fairly typical where we see people taking more vacation time and so on. So you'll tend to see OpEx decline, which it did nicely. We would expect in the first quarter, OpEx to increase. A good is to look back at last year. Last year's fourth quarter, our OpEx was up around $30 million quarter-over-quarter and that was a direct effect of the increase that we typically put into place in the first quarter, as well as just far fewer vacation days in the quarter. So again, we'd expect to see a similar up on a quarter-to-quarter basis to what we saw a year ago. In addition to that, you might note that I did give R&D guidance as being up a little bit from what we spent this past year and that will start immediately in the first quarter. So I would expect it to be up OpEx in the first quarter at a faster growth rate than what we saw in the year-ago quarter, again on the function of paying benefit increases, fewer vacation days and stepped up spending on R&D.
Ron Slaymaker
For your question it's a mix of revenue, that is TV and PCs, you're going to get a bonus answer and I'm going to breakout our revenue overall by market. This is for 2010 as a whole. Communications was 42% of revenue, and that's down a few points from 2009. And I'll also note the biggest piece inside of communications is communications infrastructure. Computer was 22% of 2010 revenue, down a point from '09. Let me break that 22% out because it goes across several different areas. PCs actually is about 9%. That's what we sell directly into PC manufacturers. Beyond that, we also have sell into storage manufacturers both in terms of hard disk drives, as well as optical. That's about 6% of revenue. Servers is 1%. Monitors are 4%. And really think of that as DLP front projector revenue. And then printers are 2%. And then continuing at the TI level, industrial is 14% of revenue or was 14% last year. And that's up a few points from 2009. Consumer was 11% and that's unchanged from '09. And inside of that, Ross is the TV number, but I don't have a specific breakout for television. Automotive last year was 8%, up a couple of points from '09. And then education, which is really our calculator product, was 3% in 2010, down one point from 2009.
Operator
We'll go next to Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital
Maybe from the fourth quarter and as you look at the first calendar quarter guidance, could you give us, Kevin, any feel for the contribution from the revenues associated with the factory service deals that you have in China or in Japan? And separately, rather in the vein of Ross' question on the OpEx side, in seeing a somewhat lower gross margin in the calendar fourth quarter, could you give us some feel for what some of the puts and takes might be in what appears to be a slightly lower gross margin for the first quarter?
Kevin March
Tim, on the revenue from the Transition Services Agreement, we've focused in the past and still hold forecast that we expect those revenues to be less than 1% of our 2011 overall revenues. And we won't break it down any more than that or by quarters anymore than that. I would just put a little bit more color on that, remind you that with the Chengdu fab, as we disclosed, that transition service agreement will run for three or four quarters before it winds down. And with the Spansion fab, that transition services agreement will run for up to two years and winding down during the course of that period. But overall, revenue is expected to be less than 1% of our 2011 revenue.
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital
Is the contribution Kevin fairly similar in the fourth quarter and the first quarter? Or is that helping, to some extent, with the slightly better than seasonal guidance?
Kevin March
It will be fairly similar quarter-over-quarter. Fourth quarter versus the first all in quarter for all three of those factories, specifically those who are doing the transition services agreement on. So, first quarter should be offset. And your second question Tim on OpEx?
Timothy Luke - Barclays Capital
More on gross margins puts and takes as we begin the year.
Kevin March
You indicated you felt maybe gross margin might be a little different in the first quarter. I would remind you that we do expect utilization to be up a little bit in the first quarter. I'm not quite sure how you're putting that into your model, but do make sure that you've got the OpEx properly accounted for on 4Q going into 1Q. That is it was up $30 million a year ago. It should be up more than that this quarter because we're stepping up our R&D. Also, don't forget that should just stock dividend equivalent adjustment that we have to make on our earnings per share. We need to make a similar adjustment when you do your model so you get back to what you think is the target GPM percent of course.
Operator
We'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research
The orders down 9% this quarter, revenue guidance down about 3%. Is that mismatch strictly because of the order linearity in the quarter? And can you give me some feeling I guess if October or is it a little bit more normal might those two numbers, orders and revenue guidance been more closely matched?
Kevin March
What we really see in there, Stacy, is as lead times came in, as they started coming in the third quarter, we already began to see our book to bill fall below one, which is really quite normal. So, customers who may have been putting six months backlog on us, as we began to move the lead time in, didn't have to give us backlog orders as far out in time. Frankly, they could go for a few weeks or even a couple of months without putting new orders on and still have the backlog coverage they want. So we saw that sort of phenomena going on in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And it's quite normal and was quite expected. The other thing that we did see, that gives again reassurance as to the outlook that we provided for the first quarter is that we had a backlog coverage going into first quarter that frankly was higher than we've seen for a number of years. That's consistent I think with what we've been talking about, the markets, the major markets of PC and TVs we talked about, pretty much cleared their inventory in the fourth quarter and were beginning to see kind of a normal order pattern beginning to show up as we came into late fourth quarter and currently as we move further into the first quarter as well.
Ron Slaymaker
I would add maybe two other things, Stacy. Again, it's not new but just reiterating what we said. Our views of the corrections and adjustments to customer inventories and where they are in that progress is part of the reason. Another reason is, maybe the last reason would be that just what we've seen quarter to date in terms of strength, both in terms of orders and revenues play into that confidence as well.
Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research
Regarding the R&D guidance, can you give us some feeling for where you're investing the incremental spend in terms of the specific types of projects or areas?
Kevin March
It's going to be across the core area, Stacy, of Analog, Embedded Processing and the non-baseband portion of wireless. But I would just say that given the size, Analog will get most of those dollars. And then you'll get a distribution of that into the Embedded Processing next and the remainder, the growth will go into the non-baseband portion of wireless. But it's all in the core product areas. It is not in other areas.
Operator
We'll take our final question from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
Just a follow-up to an earlier question, on the $435 million, which is baseband, how do we think we should model that? It sounds like no incremental suppliers to your big customers until mid-year. And so, flattish first half and then a decline. How should we think about that?
Ron Slaymaker
John, you've heard us say before that if you straight line from where we are today down to zero in the first quarter '13, the only thing we can tell you is that'll be wrong. You'll have some quarters above; you'll have some quarters below. I know qualitatively, I've tried to describe that most of that revenue is 3G and until they have a 3G player ready to start supplying that revenues, well, I won't say it's stable, but it will move with our customers' own business levels. But we've kind of given up forecasting when they're going to have a specific alternative supplier on board. I'm going to shift that risk to you as the analysts now. But you at least know that our mix of 3G to be able to base that on.
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
If you look over the last decade, you guys have always done a good job growing R&D slower than you grow revenue, and I know you're not going to him to easily back into a revenue guidance for the year but when you look at the R&D guidance up over 8% for the year, is there something unusual about this year that is a structurally high investment year? Or when we think about the core business x Baseband, is that leverage that you guys have been able to show in the past still applicable?
Kevin March
I don't know what your revenue assumption is John but it sounds pessimistic. You said R&D up...
John Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG
Is there anything that you see in the R&D for this year specifically which would drive R&D growth faster than revenue growth?
Kevin March
No.

Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at www.ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.
Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for December 7. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update.
In today's call, we'll describe how TI's strategic position in our core businesses of Analog, Embedded Processing and smartphone chips continues to strengthen. We'll discuss our manufacturing strategy and recent additions that we have made to our analog capacity. We'll also provide our perspective of the near-term demand environment.
Revenue in the third quarter generally tracked closely with our initial expectations in the quarter. In July, the middle of our guidance range projected about 6% sequential revenue growth. We held that level with our September update and in the end, we delivered 7% growth.
Although our results are good, demand is a bit of a mixed bag. The industrial market was strong for us in the third quarter as it continued a cyclical recovery. We believe this market has now recovered and, therefore, we expect industrial growth will be somewhat less robust in the fourth quarter. In communications, wireless infrastructure was strong as operators continue to expand capacity to support increased data traffic. Accordingly, demand for chips that we sell into smartphones was also strong in the quarter. As we said at our September update, we saw a notable slowing in demand for products that we shipped into the PC market during the third quarter. We expect demand from our PC customers to remain subdued in the fourth quarter. Similarly, some of the consumer-related markets, such as televisions, also slowed in the third quarter, and we expect these trends to continue through the current quarter.
The increase in TI revenue was driven by growth across all of our segments. Analog revenue grew 5% sequentially and 35% from a year ago. Sequentially, Analog revenue was up most in High-Performance Analog, where we have higher industrial exposure. High-Volume Analog & Logic and Power Management products both grew, although to a lesser extent, with their exposure to the computing and consumer markets. From a year ago, all three product areas contributed to growth about the same and all contributed to TI's market share expansion in Analog.
Embedded Processing grew rapidly again this quarter. This partly reflects its exposure to markets that performed well, including industrial and communications infrastructure. It also reflects continued market share gains for TI and the strategic importance of Embedded Processing to our company. Sequentially, Embedded Processing grew 12% with both communications infrastructure and catalog products contributing about equally to this growth. Catalog products include both digital signal processors and microcontrollers. From a year ago, Embedded Processing grew 47% with catalog product being the biggest factor in the growth.
Wireless revenue grew 6% sequentially and 11% from a year ago. Collectively, products targeting the smartphone market, both being connectivity products and OMAP applications processors, grew 6% sequentially and 37% from a year ago. These are the Wireless products that we're investing in for growth. We've had tremendous design-in success especially with our latest generations of OMAP applications processors across a range of smartphones and tablets, and we look forward to solid growth as our customers' new product transition into volume production. Baseband product revenue was $438 million in the quarter and grew 5% sequentially and declined 3% from a year ago.
Our Other segment revenue grew 10% sequentially, driven by custom ASIC products, DLP products and calculators. From a year ago, this revenue was up 29%, with growth from DLP products and custom ASIC products being the biggest factors.
Distribution resales were up 8% sequentially in the quarter, about the same as TI revenue overall. We were able to help distributors build a few days of inventory in the third quarter. We're comfortable that their inventory is appropriate relative to current levels of demand and to historical metrics. Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial performance this quarter underscores the benefit of our transformation to a company focused on Analog and Embedded Processing.
Gross profit increased 8% sequentially and our gross margin moved up another 30 basis points to 54.5% of revenue. The combination of R&D and SG&A increased $38 million from the second quarter with most of the increase in R&D, especially for our core businesses.
Operating profit for the quarter was $1.23 billion, an increase of 11% from last quarter as we once again pushed the bar higher from last quarter's record high. Operating margin in the third quarter was 32.8% of revenue.
Net income in the third quarter was $859 million or $0.71 per share. In the EPS calculation, please note that accounting rules require that we allocate a portion of net income to any unvested restricted stock units that receive dividends. In the third quarter, the amount of net income excluded from the EPS calculation was $13 million. If you don't make this adjustment, you'll likely calculate EPS to be $0.01 higher than we have recorded.
I'll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for your review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $1.32 billion. This was up $756 million from the last quarter and up $484 million from a year ago.
Capital expenditures increased to $396 million in the quarter and include additions to our assembly and test capacity as well as our Analog wafer fab capacity.
In July, we announced that we had purchased additional 200-millimeter fab and 300-millimeter equipment as part of Spansion-Japan's bankruptcy proceeding. This purchase closed on schedule at the end of August, and we are now porting TI's Analog process technology into that fab.
Earlier this month, we announced that we also acquired our first wafer fab in China. This 200-millimeter operational fab was also purchased at a substantial discount and will support our growth strategy for Analog in the years ahead. With these acquisitions, we believe we are very well positioned with wafer fab capacity to support our intermediate-term growth plans.
Return on invested capital in the quarter moved up to 34%. Our strategy is to drive significant growth while also generating higher returns our investments. Having purchased manufacturing assets that have long productive lives and purchasing those assets opportunistically at low prices is an important part of the strategy.
We used $600 million in the quarter to repurchase 24 million shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $143 million in the quarter. We increased our inventory by $75 million in the quarter while lowering inventory days by one day to 75.
Our lead times have continued to decline as we bring additional manufacturing capacity online and get better positioned with inventory. Orders in the quarter declined to $3.43 billion. TI's book-to-bill ratio was 0.92 in the quarter.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.36 billion to $3.64 billion in the fourth quarter or down 10% to down 3% sequentially. Part of the decline will be associated with the normal seasonal decline in calculators following back-to-school as well as seasonality in semiconductors. Depending on where we land in this range, revenue could come in a little below normal seasonality due to the impact of continued subdued demand from our computing and consumer customers.
We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.67. Our estimate for 2010 R&D now rounds up to $1.6 billion. Our estimates for 2010 depreciation, capital expenditures and the annual tax rate are unchanged.
In summary, we continue to execute on a strategy that is focused on significant expansion of our market position in the Analog and Embedded Processing markets, as well as the strong growth resulting from increasing demand for smartphone chips. These are all large, diverse markets that provide us an excellent opportunity for long-term growth. Combining the financial returns of these markets with growth that is significantly above market rates will deliver an earnings model that we believe will be attractive to long-term shareholders.
We are also maintaining a strong discipline on capital and spending levels. If we find great opportunities for investment, we have a strong balance sheet and have resolved to move aggressively to pursue them, such as you've seen us do with the manufacturing assets that we've purchased over the past year. If we're generating cash beyond the needs of the business, we're proud to return it to our shareholders through share buybacks and increased dividends. For example, since the end of 2004, we've lowered our shares outstanding by 32%. This means that all else being equal, our shareholders are now getting 47% more earnings per share than they would have had we not done these repurchases. And in September, we announced our board authorized an additional $7.5 billion in repurchases or about 25% of our recent market capitalization and another dividend increase.
We're confident that continuing to tune our business to generate higher growth and earnings while also maintaining a capital model that lower our shares outstanding will be a good combination in the years ahead. With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. [Operator Instructions]
"
2010-10-26,Q&A," Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Danely of JPMorgan.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Just to clarify, you continue to expect the lead times to normalize by the end of this quarter?
Kevin March
Chris, lead times did come in, in the third quarter, and we expect them to continue to come in, in fourth quarter. And if all goes well, then as we enter next year, we should have lead times back to normal.
Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co
And then as my follow-up, it seems like the PC and the consumer end markets are below normal. Is everything else roughly normal? Or is anything above normal?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, I would say probably -- is this a fourth quarter question? I guess what I would say is you're right. Those are the areas that would be below kind of the normal run rate. Probably the one area I would say that continues to be strong is comms infrastructure. Handsets, since we only have one customer there really, I don't want to provide any specific commentary. Industrial, I would say probably the best description there is that it's normalizing. It's transitioning from third quarter, which is really an extension of the first three quarters this year, where it has been growing pretty rapidly due to that cyclical recovery. But I would say fourth quarter would represent more normalizing to probably a more typical seasonal pattern from industrial. So you did identify really the two areas that we would call out as being weaker. Those being computing and parts of the consumer markets.
Operator
Our next question comes from Glen Yeung of Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
Ron or Kevin, it just doesn't feel like this cycle is as dramatic as maybe we've seen other cycles in the past. At least, that's my perception. I wonder one, if you agree with that. Two, when do you think that inventory issue might be over and what are the clues that you have that suggest that to you, if that's in fact what you see?
Kevin March
Glen, I think your perception probably is shared by us. That is that the adjustment that we're seeing underway are starting now is probably more focused and not broad-based and is probably generally pretty mild. If you look in the past, when you look at book-to-bills, typically, if we get to four, five, six quarters of positive book-to-bills and followed by a couple of quarters of negative or near one book-to-bills, I would typically suggest that maybe a couple of quarters from an adjustment phase before we have a resumption of demand. In the PC and consumer space, as we've discussed here, we saw demand soften up in that quarter, so we're probably halfway through our first quarter on that. And so if we take a look out, it would be, from our view, reasonable to assume that we get through this adjustment process over the next quarter or two, and then we see a resumption of overall end market demand.
Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc
There's a press release just a little while ago about ZTE spending a bit of money. You guys are named as one of the people with whom they'd be spending. I wondered if you could just shed any light on that particular announcement and help us to understand whether or not this is something that's new with these guys, with ZTE, and if there are any material elements of the contracts we should know about.
Ron Slaymaker
Glen, I guess I probably don't have a lot to say. I'd refer you to ZTE in terms of anything they may want to offer. But we've had a strong presence in China overall, and we've had a relationship specifically with ZTE for many years. So I think this is just an extension of a lot of good things that had been happening for TI for some time and our growing momentum in that market, which is one that we see is going to be especially important for TI in the years to come. But beyond that, I really don't have anything specific to say about that one specifically.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra of Robert Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated
The ramping capacity you're putting in place implies a lot of market share gains over the next couple of years. What's your pricing outlook for Analog with regards to that strategy and also in lieu of the current weakness that we're seeing in some end markets probably at the low end?
Kevin March
Tristan, I don't think that the capacity that we're adding necessarily has any bearing on our pricing outlook per se. But capacity, you may recall, that we began over a year ago with the acquisition of equipment from Qimonda, who was in bankruptcy at the time, to begin to put 300-millimeter equipment into our fab, our Richardson fab. We went through a second phase on that with another location they had in Dresden where we purchased equipment to complete Phase II in RFAB. In addition last quarter, we announced acquiring Spansion of Japan out of bankruptcy. And this past month, we announced our first manufacturing acquisition for manufacturing plant in China. To put in perspective where we're at in those acquisitions right now, the RFAB qualified its first products this quarter, and we do expect to ship our first revenue-generating wafers out of that factory this quarter. It will ramp up consistent with demand. As Spansion is concerned, the one we acquired in Japan, we expect to have our first wafers out of that factory by the end of this quarter as we ported one of our processes into that factory. And with the Chengdu factory in China, in fact, we had already been using that factory as a foundry for some of our HVAL products, and we will be porting additional products into that factory over the next couple of quarters. So we would expect those factories to ramp up fairly slowly on our products consistent with whatever we see in demand. In the meantime, those two factories, the one in Japan and the one in China, in both cases, we have transitional service agreements with the sellers, whereby we are selling them some products out of those factories that, to a large extent, will offset our operating costs as we bring up our own process technologies in those factories.
Ron Slaymaker
So Tristan, I guess the only thing I would add is if you think about what Kevin said, I mean, even with RFAB or we're moving into production this quarter, as of now, we have one product qualified and moving into production. So really, if you think about the timing of that as well as the other two factories and you compare that to what Kevin said previously about this period of market weakness, our view is going to be relatively short-lived and mild. Those factories ramping really are probably coming on more online on the other side of this period of weakness as opposed to a lot of market weakness is underway.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated
How do you expect resales to track in Q4 versus sales that you mentioned that your inventory level in the channel were at normal levels? Was it fair to assume that you don't expect any type of adjustments for this coming quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Tristan, I probably -- I guess as I'll stick with our normal practice which is we don't try to forecast resales in the out quarter. I mean, probably the best I can do is point out that if you look in the prior quarter, the third quarter, resales generally tracked very closely with TI's own revenue trends, but I don't have a specific projection for you on resales in Q4.
Operator
Our next question comes from Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Ron, thinking about 300-millimeter here and where we are on this kind in the whole cycle, you've got things moderating a bit. Industrial seems like it's peaked out. Am I taking it correctly in saying it's not necessarily slowing down, it's just not going to grow as fast as we have seen over the last several quarters or so?
Ron Slaymaker
I think you have it right. It is slowing down but the comparison is to a cyclical recovery, so it's moving more to seasonal patterns. It's not expected to go through a -- at this point, we don't see a correction per se. We just see it moving to a more normalized seasonal patterns.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
So if we've got things returning to normal, you're bringing up 300-millimeter, it sounds like pricing remains firm. You've had a nice ramp of margin improvement here. Why shouldn't we expect say through next year that margins will continue to improve as your cost base drives down. It doesn't sound like we're in a downward cycle with demand and yet your costs have got to be starting to drop, especially if you bring up this new fabs cost operating costs in terms of the agreements you've gained with the people you're buying them from.
Kevin March
Edward, clearly bringing on these factories, at these kind of cost profiles, certainly is a favorable outlook for our overall margins. Importantly, as Analog and Embedded Processing become a bigger portion of our overall portfolio, that also will give us more tailwind on our margins. But the fact of the matter is we're not really focusing on trying to improve our margins so much as we are focusing a lot more on trying to improve our top line growth. You've heard us talking for a number of quarters now about having a growth objective, whereby we are considerably outgrowing our markets and gaining market share from our customers. And that's really where all our energy and focus is at. That doesn't mean that we will not let margins fall through as they produce themselves, but that's not what we're aiming at and that's not the purpose of the acquisition of those factories. The purpose of the acquisitions of those factories is really to support the top line growth. And happily, those factories came to us at very inexpensive costs.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Just as a clarification, then. If it comes down between you're not getting the top line growth that you're after and your margins are at record levels, we would be reasonable to assume that the margins will be capped and maybe a little more aggressive pricing profile so that you can build the top line?
Kevin March
I don't think I'd make any assumptions, Edward. I think that we don't set the prices. The markets set the prices, and we can't anticipate how competitors will respond to customer demands. What we're really focused on is making sure that we have adequate capacity to grow as rapidly as we can, as our customers will accept our products. But to infer that, that would lead us to a pricing decision would be an incorrect conclusion, because frankly, prices are set competitively, not unilaterally in our space.
Ron Slaymaker
And as you've heard us say for some period but for the broader audience, especially in Analog, pricing is determined more based on the quality of the product, the specifications of the product, the performance levels of the product, and you have to be competitive on pricing. But that's not how you win business. You win business based upon the quality and performance levels of the product. And so even in a weaker market environment or if growth is not producing the levels that we expect, you don't change that fundamental dynamic by changing your prices. Changing prices or lowering prices below market just leaves the money on the table. It does not result in incremental revenue for the vast majority of our product lines. There's a small part of our product line that represents less than 5% of our revenue that would be considered commodity type products that is price-elastic, but again, that's a net relative to, I think, the broader product portfolio.
Operator
And our next question comes from Ramesh Misra from Brigantine Advisors.
Ramesh Misra - C.E. Unterberg, Towbin
My first question is in regards to your capital spending. So you've been very opportunistic over the last 12 to 18 months, but it sounds like you're still looking for opportunities here? And if you found inexpensive fab, you'd still be expanding capacity. So at what point would that stop?
Kevin March
Ramesh, what I have indicated to in my opening remarks was that we believe that we have acquired enough capacity to meet our intermediate-term growth objectives. So we're pretty satisfied with what we've got so far. Now that's not to say that if we continue to find some of those factories at price points that frankly are unheard of in our time in this industry that we may not consider them for acquisition. But our focus now is on bringing these factories up that we have and bringing price up in the production, getting ready for what we believe will be a resumption of growth in the industry in the next couple of quarters.
Ron Slaymaker
I think Kevin was just saying in general, we look for investment opportunities that make sense for our business that could be smaller acquisitions or that could be the capital equipment that you've seen us. But probably the former would be the priority.
Ramesh Misra - C.E. Unterberg, Towbin
In your Other segment, did you see weakness in the consumer-oriented parts of it as well such as calculators? In other words, was your strength in the Other segment driven predominantly by your custom ASICs?
Ron Slaymaker
It wasn't. I don't want to say predominantly. We actually saw calculators increase sequentially from the second quarter to third quarter but that's just seasonal. Back-to-school usually peaks in the third quarter for us, and third quarter typically increases somewhat beyond second quarter. The biggest area of sequential strength in that Other segment was in custom ASIC. I would probably know the couple of areas inside of that. One is we do have a significant part of our custom ASIC business that goes in the communications infrastructure, both wireless PlayStations as well as the enterprise side and both increased sequentially in the quarter. And then we also sell custom ASIC products. This is kind of more one off but for touchscreen controllers going into smartphones that's also did nicely for us in the quarter. So that's a little bit of insight into the custom ASIC. The other area that we mentioned was DLP. DLP is still being dominated in terms of that revenue base by front projector business, and it continues to be a nice business and it's even have shown some recent growth for us, so no real change on that front though.
Operator
And our next question comes from Uche Orji from UBS.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
Ron, can I just ask you, within the Edge file business, you talked about weakness in computing and consumer products. How was that stabilizing now in terms of booking strength? And within that also, can you talk about whether you have any position in the tablet markets and what that will mean for TI?
Ron Slaymaker
I think if you look at HVAL, you are right. There's probably there, the computing tie is more through products that go into hard disk drives. Our Power Product line in Analog also sells into PCs, some of the Power Management products, but HVAL is probably more through hard disk drives and storage products. I think your description of that -- well, I'll just say we expect that it will continue to be, what I said before, demand will continue kind of the current trends that we saw in the third quarter of slowing going into the fourth quarter as well. HVAL also sells into a range of other products such as smartphones. Some of the Power Management areas in smartphones, they sell into some video gaming on the consumer side. And even though we've said consumer televisions are weak, there were other areas such as video gaming on the consumer side, and that actually did reasonably well for us in the third quarter. And I'm trying to think if there are other areas of notable to mention. Those are probably the ones I would tie. Yes, maybe a final one would just be infrastructure. It sells into some of that communications and wireless infrastructure as well, and of course, that's almost anything that's touching infrastructure for us that would be, I guess, on both the HVAL side but then also some of the HPA products tie into comms infrastructure as well. And as I said, anything that we have selling into infrastructure whether it was the ASIC products I've mentioned, the Embedded Processing products or some of these Analog products have done well. And we would expect to continue doing well into the fourth quarter.
Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank
We've talked about tablets. We've seen some strengths in tablets markets. And my question here is how does that impact TI across the board, one would obviously expects gains for the OMAP business, but I would like to get a sense of your focus there and your positioning in some of the upcoming tablets? And then how that cuts across other segments of your business through -- we talked about HDD. Obviously, tablets are going to cannibalize the PC. What would be impact of that on TI? Or do you have a commensurate gain also on tablets offset in the weakness there? So any comments you can make as what it means for TI across with your OMAP business?
Ron Slaymaker
So I would say we saw a lot of -- I guess I would describe it as principally various Analog products, for example, Power Products that go into tablets. We saw strength in those areas as you might guess in the third quarter. That strength was not -- even though it's a nice growing business and offset some of the weakness that we saw along on the PC front or the notebook front, it wasn't the PC exposure these days just because of the relative size of that market, of course. It's higher for us. We'll see how that changes over time. But those tend to be some of the more -- those type of products tend to be a little less visible, I guess you might say. I know I see all the various tear downs and they try to describe who has this processor or that processor. Products like Power tend to run under the radar. A couple of other areas I would mention the audio amplifiers, some of the connectivity products, certainly, there's opportunity in tablets. And then, as I previously mentioned clearly, OMAP as the main processor to handle some of both the applications, the graphics, et cetera, certainly, is a great opportunity. But the opportunity goes well beyond OMAP, and we're already benefiting even in third quarter from the growth of tablets, and we expect that to just broaden as products like OMAP transition into production in that space.
Operator
Our next question comes from Shawn Webster of Macquarie Capital.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
On the factories, is what you're spending for the factories in China and Japan part of your capital expenditure budget? And then can you add some color on, you said you were getting some revenues from some of these factory agreements? Can you quantify that? So how much that's contributing into Q4?
Kevin March
Shawn, the factories, some portion of those acquisitions are in capital and some portion of those acquisitions are being accounted for as an acquisition of the business. In fact, you could see that on the cash flow statement with our earnings release. For example, on the Japan acquisition, we used net of about $130 million acquiring all of those assets and about $59 million of that is for an acquisition of the business in the balance acquisition that goes through CapEx. With the acquisition in Chengdu, we will initially used about $140 million in acquired net asset. And most of that will probably through the acquisition of the business. The remaining $35 million or so will be earned out on the acquisition over the course of next year. So it's a bit of a mix. Some of it's going through CapEx and some of it is acquisition of a business. As far as the revenue that we expect, we anticipate that the revenue that we will get through those transition service agreements will be less than 1% of TI's revenue. And by and large, what that will wind up doing is absorbing the cost of those factories during the period that we are bringing up our own process technologies and tie those factories.
Ron Slaymaker
So transitionally, I guess the other way that we tend to look at this, yes, there will be a little bit of benefit as we have some of that revenue in Q4 that we did not have in Q3. But at the same time, I'll remind you that we also are selling our cable modem business, and we expect that transaction to close in Q4. And for the most part, what we lose in Q4 transitionally on cable modem will be about the same amount that we will gain through some of these transitional supply agreements.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
Maybe just on gross margins and utilization rates, can you give us I guess your view on the puts and takes for gross margins going into Q4 and maybe into the first half? And also, can you share with us what your utilization rate trends were in terms of are they higher in Q3, lower in your expectations for Q4?
Kevin March
Shawn, we haven't publicized our utilization rates in a while but that would just leave it to say it that they were relatively flat for the last couple of quarters, and with the increasing capacity coming online and our expectation of decline in revenues going into the fourth quarter, we expect our utilization probably to drop a little bit, but I don't think there's going to be any material impact especially given the cost of the capacity we brought online. We don't give a GPM forecast. We just give a revenue and earnings per share forecast. And I think I'll just leave it at that for now.
Operator
Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri of CLSA.
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Ron, on the distributors growing inventory a little bit, I'm just wondering, given that demand is weakening on the margin and also you're heading into a seasonally weaker period, why would the distributors be building inventory? Is it because there is some pockets of strength? Or is it because some regions needed more inventory if you describe then?
Ron Slaymaker
I think it's because they needed more inventory in certain product lines and certain areas. I mean, keep in mind, lead times have been extended and supply has been constrained for some period. And even though we've made progress, lead times are still, as Kevin pointed out earlier, extended beyond where we really want them as of right now. And so I think, as things have loosened up a little bit, we and the distributors took advantage of that in the third quarter to put in place some inventory that they really had been trying to get in place for some time.
Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.
Kevin, on the gross margin, just wondering about as we head into the first half which is seasonally somewhat softer, besides the utilization coming down maybe a bit, should we expect any incremental depreciation from some of the new acquisitions?
Kevin March
Srini, there will be some incremental depreciation. And in fact, with the qualification of RFAB this quarter, we expect to see depreciation going up a little bit in the fourth quarter. But I would remind you also that there's a natural roll-off that goes on. So while depreciation may be up for a couple of quarters, I expect it will come back down as we move into next year. In fact, if you just kind of step back and take a look at the broader picture, you may recall that we depreciate on a five-year straight-line basis. If you go back to 2005 and look at our capital expenditures back then, it was about $1.330 billion if I recall. And that's beginning to roll off and will roll off over the next couple of quarters. Our CapEx forecast for this year is $1.2 billion. And I mentioned earlier that some of those acquisitions are going through acquisition of the business. So if you add it all together and we're probably talking about $1.4 billion or so of assets that we're acquiring this year that will be depreciated. So to a large extent, what's rolling off will be replaced with the acquisitions that we've made in 2000 and plan to make here in 2010. And so year-over-year, we don't expect our depreciation to change all that much. We'll be able to give a more precise outlook on that after we close the fourth quarter. But for some early planning and for trying to figure out what depreciation might do for GPM, that may help frame that for you a little bit.
Ron Slaymaker
So, Kevin, I guess I would just add on the question. So fixed cost are relatively stable. But what about some of the variable costs then associated with the new factories we're bringing on?
Kevin March
The variable costs of RFAB will scale with revenue. So clearly, staffing and material cost and so on are highly variable and will be brought on only as revenue pulls demand through that factory. And then the variable costs associated again with the acquisitions in Japan and China, by and large, are being offset by the Transition Services Agreement as we bring up our new processes there. So we expect a fairly smooth transition unless those Transition Services Agreement begins to shift downward, and that cost is left behind, that should happen about the same time that we're bringing up our own production inside those factories and we can absorb that into the revenue-generating wafers.

Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research
Very quickly on the Wireless business, so you had all pieces up but we had OMAP application process as they were up definitely little less than connectivity. And I actually found that a little bit surprising. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you think is driving I guess the larger offset that you're seeing particularly in connectivity in terms of end market or products. And if you could comment a little bit on how you see market share in application processors, particularly as that market is growing very strong when you have competitors like Qualcomm and some of the other guys that are also making their pushes in there as well?
Ron Slaymaker
Stacy, I guess I would just say that what's driving growth in connectivity are just a series of design wins that we've accomplished over the last several years. I believe we have the most integrated connectivity solution that's out there centered up on our WiFi solutions. And even if you look at where connectivity has been over the last few years and where it's going, clearly, there's a trend towards integration and a lot of the players that kind of were a single technology players just don't have the capability to integrate and do it as quickly as TI has, where we played across historically WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, FM radio. And so, it's quite natural for us to have the capability to roll that all altogether into an integrated solution. So the trend toward integration in the connectivity market has positioned just favorably worked to TI's benefit. We've won a lot of designs as a result and you're seeing that in terms of revenue growth. Now before you take that and extrapolate it too far, as I said in the prepared remarks, we've also had tremendous success in designing in OMAP 3 and OMAP 4 product generations as well. And so, I think you'll see that even though for the last few quarters, connectivity's probably been the fastest growing, that could rapidly change and go through a period of time where OMAP is growing fast. So I think you'll see both of those areas grow, but it will kind of happen in fits and starts based on as new generations of product roll out and as design wins move into production.
Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research
I think part of my first question was also on application processes as if you could address that. But my follow-up would be one more in gross margins just really briefly. I'd like to see if you could give me any color on for next quarter. Do you anticipate any sort of impact either the positive or the negative from the 300-millimeters you start to ramp back to volume? And is there sort of any measurable impact on the gross margin front from the foundry arrangement from Spansion and from Chengdu?
Ron Slaymaker
Stacy, I think we hit the apps processors in the first discussion, so we'll just going to move on and let Kevin answer the gross margin question.
Kevin March
Stacy, I think that the short answer is no on the impact from GPM. I did mention earlier that we will see depreciation go up a bit in fourth quarter because we have now qualified most of the equipment in RFAB. So clearly, that will be there. But I don't think it will actually move the needle that much from an overall GPM standpoint.

Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
My question on ROIC, Kevin. You do give out the number every quarter. I'm just going back looking historically. I don't think you guys have been as high and now you're bumping up against that other analog company that's only slightly more profitable than you. Is there a target that you're managing the business to, Kevin?
Kevin March
No. On the return on invested capital, you're right, it's pretty high this quarter. We're about 34.2% by my math there. I wouldn't say that there is a model per se other than that we're mindful of the fact that profitable enterprises has have to return on their capital in excess of what their of cost of capital is. So clearly, as long as we're above that, we believe we're adding value to our shareholders and clearly, we are well above that right now. One of the things that high ROIC does do for us is that it allows us to generate healthy levels of cash. And as we've seen here, certainly for an extended period of time, cash in excess of what we need to actually grow and operate our business on a day-to-day and quarter-to-quarter basis, which allows us to be pretty aggressive on buying back shares and also over time, returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends as well.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
And a quick follow-up, Kevin, and actually, maybe Ron could answer it as well. What is the normal seasonality for the OMAP and the Connectivity business for Q4? Or given the design win momentum you have, is that not relevant in the coming quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Ambris, I would probably agree with the latter. I think in general, what we're seeing there are secular trends that go well beyond any kind of normal seasonality that might apply in the wireless market. So I guess I would agree with your conclusion there that, that doesn't matter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Caso of Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP
I wondered if you could talk a bit about the strategy going forward on adding the new capacity. And there's obviously been a lot of talk from some of the analysts side some of your competitors about where the low hanging fruit is for you guys. What do we see as we go through the next year in terms of where you guys would expect sort of the most growth as a result from this new capacity?
Kevin March
Chris, the capacity we're putting in place is aimed directly at our Analog portfolio. If you take a look from a 300-millimeter standpoint, clearly, the higher volume first, especially those parts that are developed in our HVAL business as well as some of our higher volume Power parts and certain other parts would be prime candidates to go to that factory. I also mentioned earlier that the factory in Chengdu, China was already manufacturing some parts for us for our HVAL business and we'll continue to do that. And as we port our processes in there, we expect to put our Power MOSFET business into that factory as we go into 2011. And then as it relates to our factory in Japan, the process reporting there will be initially ideal to suit the High-Performance Analog business portfolio. So each of those factories will be able to support all three elements of our Analog. But again, they're really aimed at the Analog portfolio. As we look into 2011, with the fab capacity brought online, we'll be continuing to pay attention to our assembly and test capacity and make sure we that keep that ahead of the output from those wafer fabs.
Ron Slaymaker
So, Chris, the only thing else I would add or even just respond to this reading various sellside notes from visits to various competitors, it seems like the common denominator is that these competitors feel 300-millimeter is directed at somebody besides them. And what I would say is 300-millimeter is going to go across the board in Analog. And that means HVAL, it means Power and it means High-Performance Analog. And we won't delve off too deeply here. But 300-millimeter, we have a lot more flexibility given the automation systems in that factory to take a 300-millimeter lot of wafers and subdivide it down into two wafers of product A and four wafers of product B. That lot does not have to all be at the same product. So therefore, the argument that somehow 300-millimeter scale doesn't apply to certain areas such as High-Performance Analog makes no sense to us. And I think you'll see us move forward accordingly.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP
And I guess you guys had stopped breaking out Baseband within the Wireless. If you could give us just a bit more color, however, on sort of where we are in the transition away from the Baseband business relative to kind of what you've talked to us in the past?
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, we actually do break it out. I gave it in my prepared remarks. It was $438 million in the quarter. So that grew looks like about 5% sequentially and it was down 3% from a year ago. So again, probably nothing really has changed. I think what we've described before is that if you basically just straight-line it from here to zero by the end of 2012, you'll have quarters that you've seen, some quarters that are above that line, some quarters that are below that line. And so really, it's probably no different in terms of guidance from us. It will be a bit noisy, but that's probably about the best that we could recommend. No change in terms of when we expect that revenue basically to be essentially to zero by the time we go into the year 2013.
Operator
Our next question comes from Adam Benjamin of Jefferies.
Adam Benjamin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
You commented the fact that you thought this was going to be sort of a shallow problem here in terms of demand, and I was just curious what gave you confidence that, that's going to be the case and why based on the orders you're seeing or just some customer feedback, that will be helpful.
Kevin March
Adam, I think that a lot of times in the past, we've seen what are typically described as inventory corrections in the summer aftermarkets, it's brought on by usually an excess of inventory in the channel or more often an excess of capacity driving that excess of material. And in fact, we appear to see just the opposite of our channel inventory remains fairly lean, at least from indications from our products that we can get from permission from our customers for our products. And broadly speaking, it looks for us for the whole industry, I've seen numerous reports that indicate that total installed capacity for wafer fabs from starts standpoint globally is still down significantly from its high point in third quarter '08. Most recent stats I've seen suggest that it's still running around 14%, 15% below where it was back then. So we don't have excess capacity driving excess production. Generally speaking, we do not see much evidence of any excess components of ours up in the channel. What we do seem to be seeing is after the sweet cyclical snapback last year at many of these channels, we're seeing growth rates now that are beginning to mirror much more to what's happening in the global economy from overall demand. So from that standpoint, and just from the history of these kinds of adjustments. We'd expect a couple of quarters of relatively mild adjustment and a resumption of growth. We're not making a prediction as to what that growth looks like when it resumes, but we expect it will be a resumption of growth after a few quarters of pause.
Ron Slaymaker
And I guess just to add to that, Adam, if we talked about order trends, I mean, our orders, and of course, in third quarter, we're a step down from what we saw in the second quarter, but we also didn't see orders spiral down as we move to the quarter month-by-month. They actually stepped down in July and held up that level relatively stable through August and September. So that's just another data point, I guess, you might say is what's driving those comments from us.
Adam Benjamin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Just on the Connectivity business, I was curious how committed you are to that business going forward? Obviously, you have some significant customer concentration and you've done pretty well in terms of the portfolio and ahead of many or your peers, but I'm just looking out longer term. I know you're not going to tell us you're going to shut it down or sell it tomorrow, but I'm just curious how committed you are in terms of R&D investment going forward given that you're not in the Baseband market going forward?
Kevin March
Adam, I'll go ahead and answer that for you. I think that the R&D investment is probably good intro to an answer on that. Over the last year, we have pretty much removed all of our investment in the Baseband as we talked about multiple quarters now and directed that over to the non-baseband portion of our Wireless portfolio, which is both connectivity as well as the apps processor. Included the apps processor is getting a large share of that R&D investment. I would add that connectivity is also, as we're finding different markets for those products to be sold into, but clearly, the lion's share of the R&D is going into the apps processor space. So that is a space that is ripe for growth not only in cellphones, but in tablets and other applications as well such as personal navigation devices, infotainment systems onboard in cars, a number of different spaces where those products can be used.
Ron Slaymaker
And Adam, I guess the only other thing I would say is I know there's all these ongoing relentless debate about integrated solutions with Baseband and Connectivity products of Baseband and applications processors. But if you just look at it, our Connectivity and OMAP revenue is up over 50% year-to-date. And so, it's a great growth businesses and that's up 50% while -- I mean, it's clear we're getting out of the -- we're pulling back on Baseband and exiting that marketplace. So again, I think that data and evidence increasingly proves that can be a very good growth business for TI even without being in the Baseband business. So we'll keep riding that one hard. We like it.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
First of all, it looks like your Embedded Processor business saw a pretty nice increase in its operating margin, and I was just wondering what that came from in. I know it grew sequentially, but it was a pretty steep increase in operating margin. I'm just wondering where that came from.
Kevin March
Tore, that's really just getting leverage from the revenue growth that you saw there. The overall operating expenditures, we increased those. You might recall back in first quarter, we moved quite a few resources from our Other segment into the EP segment, into the Embedded Processing segment, which temporarily depressed operating margins there. And now as we're seeing the revenue growing very strongly there, we're just simply getting a great deal of leverage off of that.
Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
The follow-up is on CapEx. I think CapEx hit more than 10% of revenue, that's the first time in a long while. I mean, let's take Q4 '09 out of the equation here, but it's above 10%. I'm just wondering, are we getting to peak there? Are we going to start to see a trend back down to sort of the 5% to 7% level here?
Kevin March
Tore, our goal remains to be in the 5% to 8% level. And as we've indicated, that, that should be what you'll see us doing over time. We won't let that artificially to prevent us from going after very attractive opportunities such as you've seen us move on here recently. But in fact, for purposes of modeling, you should continue to expect us to operate at 5% to 8% and consider what has occurred here recently as an opportunistic aberration.
Ron Slaymaker
And clearly, I think you've heard us quantify how much revenue we can generate off of the capacity that we purchased. Clearly, that's multiple years of capacity needs probably, if anything, you could even see us moving to the lower end of that range in the near term.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
I understand your comments about that fourth quarter just the inventory, you didn't want to make a comment on that. But how about tax and zone inventory for the fourth quarter? Would you expect it to be flat up or down?
Kevin March
Jim, we grew inventory in dollar terms in third quarter and yet our days dropped about another day on us. And in fact, we would like to continue to try to grow some, especially in those areas where we have lead times that are beyond what our customers expect of us. So we will continue to operate the factories, focus on those areas where we're still short on overall capacity. And given the fact that we would expect revenue in the fourth quarter, below in third quarter, that should have some impact on our days of for as long as we go in the fourth quarter.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
The buyback you guys announced was terrific as you guys talked about a quarter of the market cap as the authorization. Your cash flow generation is terrific, but even you guys don't have that much cash in the balance sheet. Would you ever be willing to think about taking on some leverage in order to fulfill that buyback? Or should we just think about the buyback coming in as the cash flow growth continues?
Kevin March
I think it's the latter, Jim. You should look at us using our free operating cash flow for purposes of that buyback. We have no intention of doing accelerated buyback.
Ron Slaymaker
In general, thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.

Good day and welcome to the Texas Instruments, second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI’s CFO is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI’s website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for September 9th. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update.
In today’s call, we’ll provide an update on our strategic progress, discussing how the quarter’s results align with our longer term objectives. Our core businesses are the Analog, Embedded Processing and the smartphone focused applications processors and connectivity products and our wireless segment collectively made up 67% of our revenue in the second quarter. They grew 11% over the first quarter and 53% from a year ago. They are also the areas where we’re focused our R&D investments with 88% of our total second quarter R&D spend focused in these areas. These are the growth engines for the future. 
Part of the attraction of our Analog and Embedded Processing businesses is the breadth of their position across the electronics industry. With these products, we have the potential to sell into literally every electronic product that is produced. This includes computing applications such as fast growing tablet computers and at the other end of the market spectrum, includes industrial applications such as smart meters.
As we’ve seen over the past year, these end markets often move at different speeds. The recovery that began in the first half of last year initially began with the high volume computing and communications market with the industrial markets not beginning their recovery until late in the year. 
Although some of the high volume markets are now normalizing into their more typical seasonal growth patterns, the industrial market has continued its recovery. For TI this is evidenced in the strength of our various catalog product lines such as catalog micro-controllers and digital signal processors in our Embedded Processing segment as well as high performance Analog and power management products in our analog segment. 
These catalog products are typically sold through distribution often in low volumes to a large number of customers across the world. Our revenue in the US and Europe regions are both weighted toward industrial applications and both areas performed well in the quarter. 
These catalog product lines will particularly benefit over time from the size of TI’s field sales and applications force and the breadth of our product portfolio as we have a stronger capability to call on more customers and sell more products to those customers.
The notable area of weakness in the second quarter was in wireless where we experienced an unexpected slowdown late in the quarter. We believe this weakness was a customer specific issue and not a broader reflection on the market. I’ll discuss that more in a few minutes. 
Overall, TI revenue in the quarter was up 9% sequentially and up 42% compared with a year ago. Analog revenue grew 11% sequentially and was up 56% from the year ago quarter. All three of our major Analog product areas were solid contributors to this growth in both comparisons although sequential growth was most significant in high performance Analog due to its strong position in the industrial market. 
Over the past five quarters, HVAL revenue has continued to pace well with our other Analog areas and was up more than 50% from the year ago quarter. This provides additional confirmation that HVAL has turned the corner and should be a strong contributor to our growth in the years ahead. 
Embedded Processing revenue grew 17% sequentially and was up 47% from a year ago. Catalog micro-controllers and digital signal processors were the areas of strongest growth in both comparisons. The relatively large size of the micro-controller market, combined with the potential for TI to gain significant share represents our most significant Embedded Processing opportunity. Micro-controllers led our embedded processing growth in both the sequential and year on year comparison as our investments in this area are producing results. 
Wireless revenue was up 1% sequentially and up 18% compared with a year ago. Revenue of $311 million from applications processors and connectivity products for smartphones was up 6% sequentially and 52% from a year ago. These products are redefining our wireless segment and are delivering strong growth. Baseband revenue, which as expected, continued to decline, was $416 million, down 2% sequentially and about even with a year ago. Basebands are now 12% of total TI revenue compared with 17% in the year ago quarter.
As you know, we made a strategic decision to exit the Baseband market and as we do, we’re maximizing profits during our multi-year wind down of this product line and using these profits to fund growth in other areas. Revenue in our other segment comes from a mix of product lines, mostly DLP products and calculators as well as royalties. Although there will be significant variance in growth across these product lines, collectively they will have relatively lower growth. Nonetheless, they had strong profitability. 
In the second quarter, revenue in our other segment grew 9% sequentially. Calculated revenue increased seasonally and more than offset a decline in royalties. From a year ago, revenue in the other segment grew 42% mostly due to strength in DLP products. From a geographical perspective, Asia Pacific, Europe and the US regions grew sequentially while Japan declined. All regions were up from a year ago.
Turning to distribution, re-sales or sales out of our distribution channel were up almost 15% sequentially. Once again, we believe this represents share gains for TI across multiple distributors. Even with a strong resale growth, we were able to help distributors build some inventories to support future growth. Distributors’ inventory remained low by historical standards at about five weeks of inventory, similar to the past few quarters.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks Ron, and good afternoon everyone. As we’ve shifted TI’s focus to Analog and better processing, we are addressing better opportunities and our financial results are reflecting this through higher levels of profitability, better earnings per share, lower capital requirements and higher returns. Our gross profit expanded by 12% sequentially this quarter as revenue grew and grew in the right areas. 
Gross margin also increased by 150 basis points to 54.2% of revenue. Operating expenses increased $41 million in the first quarter. Almost all of this increase was focused on our core businesses. 
Operating expenses declined to 22% of revenue in the quarter. Restructuring charges in the second quarter were $17 million. This was for US pension plan settlement accounting associated with actions that occurred in 2008 and 2009. The distribution of these charges across our segments is included in our earnings release.
Operating profit for the quarter was $1.11 billion. This is the best operating profit TI has ever produced. Operating profit was 17% higher than the prior quarter. From the year ago quarter, operating profit was up $764 million. In both comparisons, the higher operating profit reflects higher revenue and the associated gross profit. 
Operating margin in the second quarter was 31.7% of revenue. Not only did our core businesses drive most of our revenue growth this quarter, they’re also grown 75% of the incremental profit. That increment in the second quarter was $759 million or $0.62 per share, an interesting comparison to the third quarter of 2007. 
Prior to this past quarter, 3Q ‘07 was our high level mark for operating profit. This quarter’s operating profit exceeded that quarter’s by 9%, even though revenue in that earlier quarter was 5% higher. Earnings per share is an even better story, up $0.10 or 19% compared with 3Q ‘07 as our operating profit gains have been further amplified by our stock repurchases. These results clearly represent the power of the portfolio changes we’ve implemented and the benefit they have provided to our financial results.
I’ll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. Well, however, let me make just a few comments. Cash flow from operations was $552 million. This was down from last quarter due to income taxes that we paid in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was about the same as a year ago. 
Capital expenditures increased to $283 million dollars in the quarter. Expenditures include the purchase of Analog wafer fab equipment as well as assembling test equipment.
Recall that we announced earlier in the quarter that we have begun the buildup of phase two of our analog capacity expansion at RFAB with the purchase of additional 300 millimeter equipment from commodities’ bankruptcy proceedings. We will continue to make opportune capacity investments to support our analog growth as these opportunities arise. 
Just last week we announced that we will be buying additional 300 millimeter equipment to help complete the RFAB phase two buildup as well as an operational 200 millimeter fab and an additional fab facility that can be equipped with 200 millimeter or 300 millimeter equipment as needed in the future.
These facilities are located in Japan and were purchased as part of Spansion Japan’s bankruptcy proceedings. The purchase price on this manufacturing capacity is attractive and these purchases will help give us the capability to significantly grow our analog business while providing strong returns on these investments. I should note that in the second quarter, our return on investor capital moved up to 31%. Our strategy is to continue to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations while making sure we have capacity in place before we need it.
We used $750 million in the quarter to repurchase 29.7 million shares of TI common stock and paid dividends of $147 million in the quarter. We were able to increase our inventory by $73 million in the quarter while inventory day held steady at 76. We have continued to improve our delivery performance and our lead times have continued to decline as we bring additional manufacturing capacity online and get better positions with inventory.
Even as we have continued in an orderly process of reducing lead times, demand from our customers has remained strong. Orders in the quarter increased to $3.7 billion. TI’s book-to-bill ratio was 1.07 in the quarter. Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.55 billion to $.3.85 billion dollars in the third quarter or 2% to 10% sequential growth. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. 
Our estimates for 2010 R&D and depreciation are unchanged from last quarter. Our estimate for 2010 capital expenditures have increased to 1.2 billion from our prior estimate of 900 million, reflecting the additional manufacturing equipment acquisitions. 
In summary, we continue to execute a strategy that will allow us to grow our analog and a better processing business significantly faster than the respective markets. Results in the second quarter confirmed the attractiveness of the strategy both in terms of the top line growth that can be produced as well as the earnings potential of these businesses and we’ve continued to pave our path for long term growth with low cost acquisitions and manufacturing capacity that will provide us competitive advantage on (inaudible) the company with unmanageable fixed costs.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks Kevin. Operator you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourselves to a single question. After our response, we’ll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up. Operator.

2010-07-20,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from Chris Caso of Susquehanna Group
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Group
Hi, thank you. First I guess if you could comment on the bookings in the quarter and you talked about in the press release up 2% sequentially. That looks like it’s slower than the growth we’ve seen in the past couple of quarters. But it sounds like the book-to-bill was actually a bit stronger than that, what you just said. If you can give some color about what you’ve seen there?
Kevin March
Sure Chris. What we saw was bookings actually broadly crossed all of our products and markets and across all the regions. We actually think the orders are coming in probably more consistently with underlying demand. You may recall that last quarter our book-to-bill was 1.14 and this quarter at 1.07. We believe what we’re seeing here is the effect of us in orderly fashion beginning to pull our lead times in, we’ve given our customers more confidence that don’t have to place orders on those (inaudible) as far out in the future as they have for the last three quarters and in addition the underlying demand is going on -- is increasing orders as well as the market share gains.
So combined, we think the order pattern is beginning to align up a consistent way with the changing lead times and just underlying growth through market growth as well as market share gains.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Group

Yes thank you, and I wish if you could talk a little bit about inventory. You talked about -- you said you built some inventory at distributors during the quarter, what’s the plan going forward? Obviously you’ve got plans to add a bunch of capacity and in addition to that I guess you are also moving to a consignment model with some of those distributors. Can you talk about as you build that inventory, is that showing up in the revenue number or is that mainly going to consignment at this point?
Kevin March

Chris, I believe we talked about re-sales of distribution were up about 15% last quarter and in addition we were able to build some inventory in the distribution channel. I would point out that the turns in that channel continue to be at a certain low levels of about five turns overall. 
On the point of consignment, that inventory cost when it was previously carried on the distribution books, is now moving on to our books and will constitute some growth that you’ll begin to see in our held inventory. But at 76 days, I’d categorize that has continued to be very lean inventory balances overall. 
As we go forward, we will continue to convert more distributor inventory to a consignment arrangement and so that we’ll shift from their books onto our books, but that will be over the next year, year and a half or so before we complete that process.
Ron Slaymaker
Jeff, as a correction, distributor weeks of inventory are about five, not turn.
Kevin March
Okay Chris, thank you and let’s move to the next caller please.

And our next question comes from Uche Orji of UBS.
Uche Orji -- UBS
Thank you very much. Can I just focus a little bit on the embedded business where you’ve seen some really strong growth; you mentioned micro-controllers being the key driver. Any color you can give us as to specific end markets strength that’s driving that strength in embedded and just as a matter of explaining whether that share gains or whether the overall industry has seen some strength in embedded, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Ron Slaymaker 
Uche, I can try to give you some, however you also have to keep in mind that the area that we said was growing more significantly in embedded processing were the catalog products, so just by definition those catalog products go into lots of different end markets and it’s not any particular end market that’s driving it. What I would say is that just in addition, catalog grew strongest but we also saw growth in coms [ph] infrastructure and automotive as well but it was catalog products that were growing more significantly and when you think about that, think about applications mirroring with one that I think I mentioned previously, motor control, you get equipment like safety equipment, medical equipment, those type of applications that come in. 
Do we believe we are gaining share? I believe so and we haven’t seen the competitor’s report but with 17% sequential growth in that business, I would venture to say that probably represents pretty clearly market share gains from TI in that area, pretty some of what you’ve seen for the last five years from TI in that area where we have been growing well above market growth rates in embedded processing and the reality is we are kind of feeling the investments in that area as well. So if anything over the course of time, we would expect to maintain that relative out performance versus market overall if not even accelerate that. 
Do you have a follow on that, Uche?
Uche Urji - UBS
Yes I do actually. Can I just ask you about wireless? Okay so probably we say just say we’re seeing early signs of the Nokia share ship to other supplies into Nokia. The baseband chops into the revenues, I’d like to get a sense as to how much this contributes to your profits for the quarter and also as we grow through the rest of the year, any sense as to how much of the baseband revenue is 3G verses 2G and should we see the modeling this going down to zero say by 2013? And that’s my last question, thanks.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay Uche, I’ll take the latter part then I’ll let Kevin make any comments he would choose about profitability there. The composition of baseband these days is 80% of that revenue is 3G and then that would leave 20% basically representing the older technologies. By comparison in the year ago quarter, 50% of that baseband revenue was 3G. So we’ve seen a very significant market shift over the course of the past year away from the older technologies and towards 3G and I believe you commented that I would agree that in terms of competitor pressure at Nokia where again they’ve acknowledged and they have a strategy to multi-source products, this year basically the competitors that they have on board will be addressing those older non-3G technologies which represent 20% of our baseband technology and then the 80% that is 3G to the best of our knowledge it will be 2011 before they have any other alternative suppliers on board with 3G basebands there. Kevin, the question regarding the contribution of baseband profitability to TI.
Kevin March
Yeah, Uche on that question there, we’ve talked in the past about the baseband products operating about a 40% kind of gross profit margin level and we’ve described in the last couple of quarters how we’ve removed pretty much all of our R&D spending on that product line. Request for that -- support for that; customer service support low entry and things of that nature, factory planning still goes with that. 
However given the nature that basebands are largely going to a single customer, we don’t really think it’s appropriate for us to give any further commentaries to profitability that would be happening inside of that particular product family.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Uche thanks for you questions and we’ll move to the next caller.

Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra of Robert Baird
Tristan Gerra -- Robert Baird
Hi, good afternoon. Regarding the Richardson fab, could you give us a sense of what percentage of that fab output potential could be in production by year end assuming that can end demand trends remain stable and when you would expect follow up.
Ron Slaymaker
Tristan, Which fab are you referencing?
Tristan Gerra -- Robert Baird
Your new a 300 millimeter fab.
Ron Slaymaker
RFAB, okay. You want to give an update on that Kevin?
Kevin March
Sure. RFAB is still on schedule to harvest our first production products exiting that factory by the end of this year. We announced of course phase one of the equipment claim to that fab late last year that would give us an incremental $1 billion of revenue capacity when fully up and running. 
In the last quarter we announced that phase two, which will give us a second incremental $1 billion total, about $2 billion of delta revenue capability when fully up and running. Of course phase two will be fully up after phase one so expect that next year or beyond. But the quick answer is that by the end of this year we expect to have qualified products shipping from that factory able to begin to generate revenue.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Tristan do you have a follow up?
Tristan Gerra -- Robert Baird
Also on the wireless revenue growth for Q3, would you expect seasonal or below seasonal output and or trans-quarter of a quarter and do you think that the 3G mix will continue to increase?
Kevin March
Tristan, that’s probably -- I think over time, it makes sense that that 3G mix will continue stay on the trend that it has been. But whether that holds for any particular quarter is probably more precise than I would want to get and then similar just in terms of our outlook, we try to keep it at the company level as supposed to individuals segments or products lines. I really don’t have a forecast for you on what we’ll expect from wireless there. But again, in general we would expect to track overall, the general performance of our customer in that market.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay Tristan, thank you for your questions and let’s move to the next caller.
Tristan Gerra -- Robert Baird
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri of CLSA
Srini Pajjuri -- CLSA
Thank you. A couple of questions; Kevin, given that the lead times are now coming in, what are you expecting for the turns business this quarter versus another -- past few quarters?
Kevin March
Srini, I don’t have a specific forecast for you on that. I would just note the terms have been pretty quick at five weeks for an extended period of time right now and so those things tend to change at a fairly slow pace but beyond that I don’t have a specific forecast for you.
Ron Slaymaker
Is there a follow up, Srini?
Srini Pajjuri -- CLSA
Yeah, just on the wireless Ron, you said that one of the customers were a week late in the quarter. I am just wondering, was it specific to the baseband business or was it more broadbased across all the products lines and also if you can address whether you expect that business to come back this quarter, thank you. 
Kevin March
Okay Srini, I think in that customer’s own pre-announcement, they described general weakness in their high end business. So as you might expect that goes across more than just basebands. It would be across apps, processors and connectivity products in terms of where we saw some unexpected weakness. 
Now, that being the case, if you look at the sequential trends, one you’ll note is that basebands were down where the other areas collectively still went up. So again that was -- but from what we were expecting with let’s say early June when we gave mid quarters guidance, all those really softened up somewhat because of that particular customer.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay Srini, thanks for your question and we’ll move to the next call

Our next question comes from Ramesh Misra with Brigantine Advisors.
Ramesh Misra - Brigantine Advisors
Good afternoon, Ron and Kevin. In terms of putting your growth numbers into historical prospective, can you give us an idea of where historically Q2 growth has been and where Q3 growth has been?
Kevin March
Okay Ramesh, what I would say is, Q2, if you look at just the last five years, the average has been at 10%, but also you kind of have to allow, at least consider last year's Q2 was exceptionally robust with 18% sequential growth. If you just move to the -- take that out and move -- look at the five years prior to that, it would have been 2 percentage points less, so 8%. So again, what we just reported, I would say generally right now that range of seasonal Q2. With respect to Q3, again the five-year average is 8%. Last year's Q3 was similarly robust with 17% sequential growth. So if you look at the five years prior to that and basically exclude the third quarter '09 you would get to a 5% growth number for sequentially Q3. 
Ramesh Misra - Brigantine Advisors
Just a quick one, Ron. In terms of gross margins, obviously, very strong last quarter. I presume that was mostly mix related. But where should we be thinking of gross margins kind of through the rest of the year or any visibility there that you can provide beyond Q3? Thanks.
Kevin March
We've talked in the past about the portfolio that should produce gross margins over time averaging around 55% and this is going to be just really a change in our mix as we move over time. I think we just did 54.2% this most recent quarter. Our focus as we move out in time now is really on top line. We believe the portfolio is able to deliver the kind of margins we talked in the past and the focus now is shifting really to accelerating our top line growth and being more aggressive with our market share gains.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, thank you very much, and let’s move to the next caller please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Great guys, thanks so much for taking the question. I'm sorry if I missed it, but I didn't hear, I don't think, where were lead times at the start of the quarter, kind of where are they today, where do you think they'll be at the end of the quarter?
Kevin March
Jim, lead times, we didn't actually characterize the number on it, that's why you didn't hear it. They came down a little bit again in second quarter as you saw in the first quarter. So we continue to make progress as we bring more capacity online and you could actually see the way we're supporting that is through de-stocking our fresh goods inventory. 
And if you actually look at our balance sheet, you'll see that's where most of our inventory build was at. As we continue to bring capacity online, notwithstanding variability and demand going forward, we’d expect that lead time to continue to come down. And it's coming down pretty much across the board, so that is -- those items that were greater than 16 weeks, we saw some of those coming down to less than 16. Those that were greater than 14, we saw some of those come down to less than 14 and so on in each of those tranches as you take a look at them. We would expect continued progress on that front.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Jim, do have a follow on?
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs
Yeah, my follow-up will be about maybe competitor lead times. What are you hearing about what competitor lead times are doing as yours come in a little bit?
Kevin March
The sort of anecdotal evidence that we're hearing, Jim, is that at least some of our competitors are actually experiencing extended lead times. We, of course, don’t order from them, so we don't know exactly what that means but we are hearing those kinds of things and we're having customers coming to us and asking us, we can't help out with some of those issues. Their customers are also recognizing that unlike our competitors, we in fact had been pretty aggressive in putting in capacity not only opening a simple test site to the bottom of the downturn last year, but starting RFAB late last year and more recently the announcement we just did last week of the acquisition of the Spansion Japan factories. That seems to be resonating well with our customers and in fact, we believe this is helping us win additional orders that should accelerate our growth going forward and accelerate our gains against those competitors from a future standpoint, let alone current lead time issues that some of them are starting to experience.
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, I just want to kind of reiterate some data I think that we shared at the Analyst Meeting. If you look at capital spending between the year 2007 and 2009, TI's capital spending was basically up 10% over that time period, where when we look at, general, the math of our competitors collectively, they were down -- and I believe this is an analog-specific comparison -- they were down on average 57%, and that doesn't even comprehend the fact that many of these analog competitors took a lot of capacity offline. 
So, in addition not to spending on new capacity, they were taking capacity offline. Customers see that data. They see the spending we're doing -- that we did through 2009 plus what we've done in addition to that and frankly, they know how that's going, they know how to extrapolate into the future, know what that situation is going to result in, in terms of availability of product and that's why I think the situation Kevin's describing is there. They're already seeing some of these various competitors start to extend lead times while at the same time they are seeing TI pulling lead times, plus as Kevin said, really lay the path for our future in terms of these capacity investments. 
So frankly, we think that's big; we think it's going to be a big differentiator for TI over the course of the next few years.
Kevin March
Okay Jim, thank you for your question and we’ll move to the next call.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Hi guys. Ron, pretty much on that topic you were just talking about, between the Spansion addition and then the Qimonda equipment, you talked about adding $3.5 billion of revenue capacity. I guess, two questions on that. First, can you tell us how much you paid for those Spansion assets? And then secondly, the $3.5 billion is about 2.5 to 3 times how much dollar growth you've seen over the last four years in your Analog business. Are you just getting more optimistic about how fast you can grow revenues or is this kind of a pull forward of CapEx? How should we think about that kind of big investments you’re making?
Kevin March
Ross, I'll go ahead and answer that. I think -- we started talking last year that as we were coming into the downturn and watching what was going on there that we would remain poised to be opportunistic to go ahead and take advantage of acquisition of capacity as well as companies, if it made sense for the smaller companies we can buy in, because the prices are so attractive. 
This is just a continuation of what we talked about back then. We have been able to acquire these manufacturing assets at extremely attractive prices. In the case of Qimonda, we were able to discuss what that pricing was. In the case of Spansion, we have not disclosed that. But I can say to you that our estimate is that the original acquisition cost of that capacity we bought is close to $2 billion and we spent -- got it for a very attractive price, one that we are not at all concerned about will cause us to have an undue level of fixed cost to have to incur should the demand take a long time to play out. 
But to go back to what Ron said a few moments ago, with the underinvestment that we’ve seen from a competitor standpoint, we expect our growth rate in fact should be poised to accelerate versus our competitors, and we may look back on this a couple years from now and find this very inexpensive type capacity acquisition to be a very opportune move for us to make the company much larger.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
So it's safe to say versus that $2 billion original acquisition price or cost what we paid was a small fraction of that, is that correct, Kevin?
Kevin March
Very small fraction of that.
Ron Slaymaker
And Ross, the other thing I would point out is, when you're looking at $3.5 billion of incremental capacity or revenue generation, I mean look at our Analog business alone, second quarter '10 over $1.5 billion, so annualize that and call it a $6 billion business. I think, last year, we were at $4.2 billion, and it's still growing. So, as we said, the strategy is to have that capacity in place before we need it. We're not trying to forecast exactly over what time period we will fill it up, but just keep in mind we're at a $6 billion run rate in terms of that revenue level today.
Kevin March
Do you have a follow on, Ross?
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Yeah, it will be a quicker one, I promise. Just -- what did the calculator business do in the quarter? I thought you guided it to be up about -- well even more than that entire other segment grew.
Kevin March
Ross, I think that we had suggested that Calculator was typically up around $65 million 1Q to 2Q, and it came in a bit stronger than that, but it was within its normal pattern that we've see in year's past.
Ron Slaymaker
And I think we also described in the release that there were some offset with lower royalties to that higher revenue as well. So Calculators was completely consistent with our expectations, and maybe even a little bit more.
Kevin March
Okay Ross, thanks for your questions, and we’ll move to the next caller.

Our next question comes from Craig Ellis of Caris & Company.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company
Thanks guys. Just a quick follow-up on the CapEx. What percent equipped will Richardson be after the Spansion assets are added?
Kevin March
Craig, we think that it will be close to half the clean room will have equipment in it, so we'll have still half the clean room available for future expansion.
Craig Ellis - Caris & Company
Any thoughts on when the company would be looking to build that out then Kevin?
Kevin March
That's going to be a function of when we continue to find the kind of opportunistic equipment acquisition that we've got in these last couple of quarters. We really -- our interest there is to build that in a very cost effective fashion and not to build it at any cost. And so you'll probably continue to see us do what we have done, and that is when we see the right price for the right equipment, we will go ahead and pursue it and that will likely be in advance of when we actually need it.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Craig, thank you and we’ll move to the next caller please.

Next question comes from Sumit Dhanda of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sumit Dhanda - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes, hi. First question, Kevin or Ron, in terms of the outlook for the third quarter, the sales increase you're talking about outstripping the order growth which hasn't necessarily been how you've guided revenues in recent quarters. So just wanted to get some more detail on the thought process around that and is the backlog build stronger, either the anticipation of that later into Q3 and also further out into Q4, any color you could shed on that?
Ron Slaymaker
Sumit, let me ask you just a clarification. When you're saying our revenue outlook outstrips our orders, again our book-to-bill in second quarter was 1.07. Can you explain what you mean when you say outstrip our orders?
Sumit Dhanda - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I meant growth rate; the growth rate in revenues versus the growth in orders witnessed in recent quarters?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. I would just say again I think what Kevin explained previously, part of the reason that book-to-bill was coming down probably would be levels that would be more consistent with true end demand is, what a lot of you guys have described for some time, although it's probably happening in a more orderly fashion than what some of you would have projected. And that -- as lead times have -- as we progressed in reducing lead times, customers no longer need to provide us the very extended visibility that they had done let's say, six months ago when lead times were kind of out at their peak level. 
So, with that lower visibility, the new orders are basically coming in to replenish at a level that is consistent with the true demand as opposed to the rate of orders basically reflecting a backlog that was extending out over time. So, probably that's about the best I can do in terms of trying to explain that. Do you have a follow on, Sumit?
Sumit Dhanda - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Just along those same lines, anything that you could offer up in terms of the momentum or the trajectory of orders that you saw through the second quarter and then initially here into July and then what's the inventory outlook on your balance sheet into the third quarter?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, I don’t know that I can sit there and describe a trajectory as we move through second quarter. I would say that orders quarter to date have remained strong and fully consistent with the outlook that we just provided in terms of revenue.
In terms of our inventory expectations, we do not at this point try to project any kind of inventory plans because our inventory plans for the third quarter really have more to do with our outlook for the fourth quarter so we may give you more visibility as we move to the quarter but at this point, we typically don’t.
Kevin March
Okay Sumit, thanks for your questions. And we’ll move to the next caller. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Glen Yeung of Citi.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Thanks. Maybe -- just wanted to open that last question. When you think about third quarter, your guidance is slightly above what would be considered normal seasonal. Can you give us a sense as to what part of your business you think may be tracking ahead of plan or ahead of normal?
Kevin March
Glen, I’d say it’s broad based. We do need to keep in mind that our third quarter is typically the quarter when customers will order material in anticipation of fourth quarter holiday sales, and even some orders in anticipation of the first quarter Chinese New Year holiday sales so this seems to be shaping up consistent with that. 
In other words, we’ve got a global economy that’s still growing, albeit at a pace that may be just a little bit down -- summarily the second half versus the first half. It’s still growing nonetheless and the order pattern that we have seen reflects that, it’s broad based, it’s probably been very strong and as we indicated earlier in the industrial and automotive segments that Ron talked about it and it’s probably gotten more to a normal seasonal kind of demand pattern in some of the other areas such as computers and handsets.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Okay, thanks. And as a second question, you guided 2010 depreciation to I think the same guidance you had before, but I’m thinking about -- you’ve now added some incremental capacity, obviously through both Qimonda and Spansion acquisitions, and I’m wondering if you were to conclude phase one of RFAB and then basically do nothing else with the assets that you’ve bought, what would be the increment to depreciation we would expect to see in 2011 or 2012?
Kevin March
Glen, I don’t have a forecast for you out quite that far but I would just kind of point you back to some of our spending over the last few years. Our depreciation over the last 12 months has been a little bit less than 7% for the last 12 months revenue. 
Our CapEx, if you include the most recent acquisitions, have been under about 9%. We’ve been talking about a CapEx target of between 5-8% so I’d say the spending is pretty consistent with that sort of -- kind of goal, that is that you’ll probably see depreciation in the 5-8% kind of range over time, and looking forward with the CapEx that we’re doing right now, it’s probably going to be still inside that range just fine.
Of course that’s a function of what you wind up with revenue up to 2011 and 12, but anticipation of the growth there, which of course is what we’re expecting with the capital acquisitions that we’re making. 
I would expect to see that depreciation kind of stay inside that range without actually getting into a dollar amount right now.
Glen Yeung - Citi
Kevin, what we have, I guess, disclosed up to now is for RFAB, the phase one purchase of that commodity equipment worth a little over 170 million, is that correct?
Kevin March
Correct, 173 million.
Ron Slaymaker
And then we bought additional commodity equipment that was roughly 75 million if I remember right, plus some incremental equipment that we didn’t disclose the amount of from Spansion, and Glen then you take those numbers, make an estimate -- maybe for some incremental equipment from Spansion and our depreciation schedule for 5 years will get you roughly into our ball park, and that’s not -- that would be pretty much before phase one or phase two of RFAB. So, at least that will help.
And then Kevin, just clarification on Spansion, the 200mm fab is an operating fab currently and when we first purchased it so that in the additional depreciation associated with that fab is already in our depreciation guidance which was unchanged that we just provided. Is that correct?
Kevin March
Correct.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, so obviously the incremental depreciation associated with that 200-milimeter Spansion fab is not very significant. Okay Glen, thank you for your questions and we will move to the next caller.

Our next question comes from Craig Berger of FBR Capital Markets.
Kyle - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Hi this is actually Kyle asking a question on behalf Craig. For your gross margin, you were talking about over time you were looking to get to 55%. However, you qualify that qualify that saying your shorter term focus is going to be top line revenue. When do you envision getting to the 55% level?
Kevin March
Actually our shorter term and longer term focus is on revenue growth. We believe the model is well on its way there, and at this point in time rather than really focusing on that kind of model and discussion of that, our focus going forward is on the top line because we believe with the portfolio we have, it will deliver the results that we've talked about. This is how we'll maximize our earnings growth in the future by growing our top line.
Ron Slaymaker
And Kyle, I'll just remind you. I mean, we just reported 54.2% gross margin. We're almost to a point where we'll be rounding 55%, so hold your breath.
Kyle - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Just a quick one, your WiLink 7 product on the multimode radio product, how is that doing? Can you add some color to that, please?
Ron Slaymaker 
Kevin, I believe that one would be for you.
Kevin March 
Well, I'm going to have to confess I don't have very much knowledge on that front, Kyle, I'm sorry.
Ron Slaymaker
Kyle, unfortunately I don't think either of us probably have a lot of specific insight into where we're with that product line, unfortunately. Although if it's a product for handsets, which is where most of our Wi-Fi focus is, we have a very strong position. I think, I mentioned before that connectivity for TI is really focused on both discrete GPS chips as well as Wireless LAN, and I'll just note that industry analysts would estimate that last year, we had about 55% share of handsets are really smartphone Wi-Fi market share. So again that doesn't gets to the specific product that you're describing or asking about, but we have a very strong position and you can rest assured we're doing what we need to do in terms of new product development to extend if not expand that share. So, the other thing I would just point out on that is all of the connectivity options in a handset Wi-Fi is the least penetrated, but it's also the most rapidly expanding. So, we like that combination for our connectivity products, and that we have share in the connectivity technology that is growing fastest in handsets. So, we think great growth in terms of revenue in terms of that product line and we expect more going forward.

Our next question comes from Shawn Webster of Macquarie Research.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
Just to clarify real quick, the new CapEx guidance, that includes Spansion acquisition?
Kevin March 
Yes, it does, Shawn.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
Then on the gross margins, can you walk us through what changed sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and comment on utilization rate trends, and do you think utilization rates will be up flat or down for Q3?
Kevin March
Shawn, I guess probably about three or four quarters ago, we stopped discussion on utilization specifically, we were discussing it when it was illustrative of what was going on, it was dropping so fast and coming back up so sharply. Our utilization levels have fared back to a much more normal level, are somewhat elevated right now given the strong demand which is why we're adding capacity. Our utilization levels really didn't change that much last quarter to this quarter, and I wouldn't expect them to change too much going to next quarter partly as a function of we're bringing on additional capacity, and so we're kind of staying ahead of it now.
Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research
Just what else changed in driving gross margins?
Kevin March 
On gross margins, yeah, really what we wind up with is mix as I had in my opening comments, not only was the majority of our revenue delta in our core product areas, but the majority of our profit dollars came through that, and that mix contributed along the GPM line as well as the operating profit line.
Ron Slaymaker
So again, just to reinforce, Analog grew 11% sequentially last quarter, Embedded Processing grew 17%. So as those areas continue to pace faster than our revenue overall, we'll continue to benefit.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christopher Danely of JP Morgan.
Christopher Danely – JP Morgan
So you talked about continuing to make progress on the lead times. Do you think that those will go back to normal levels by the end of the year?
Kevin March
Chris, I can't give a precise answer on that, I sure would like to be able to say yes, but that's going to be not only a function of the order mix that comes in, but also a function of just how fast the top line continues to grow. I mean, I’d get – it’d be fairly safe in saying that we are growing at the upper end of our guidance, it’s going to be harder than it is if grow at the midpoint or at the lower end of our guidance, but beyond that I couldn't give you a specific forecast.
Christopher Danely – JP Morgan 
And then as my follow-up, can you just give us a sense of how much your capacity is going to increase say over the next six months and then also in the first six months of next year with the new fab coming on?
Kevin March
Yeah, I think the biggest capacity increase really are on two fronts over the next six months, that's we've already discussed with the RFAB and that is 300-millimeter RFAB coming up and actually getting production material on that by the end of the year. That will be at relatively low volumes at first as you can expect, but it will ramp up all through next year. And then as to the Spansion fabs, we will get started pretty quickly here on getting process adjusted in there, so we can start wafers in those fabs by the end of the year, but I don't expect to see them qualify for production until sometime in middle of next year when we could start to actually generating revenue on product coming out of that.
Ron Slaymaker
So near term over the next six months the capacity expansion is a combination of 200-millimeter equipment that we've redeployed and spanned out through various fabs as well as the assembly test equipment. And then as we move through 2011, first half will be primarily affected by RFAB increasing and then second half would be a combination of further increases at RFAB as well as the 200-millimeter Spansion fab that would be in production by call it mid-2011.
Kevin March
Correct.

Our next question comes from Doug Freedman of Gleacher and Company.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company
Kevin, you guys have had a very successful acquisition strategy that's worked along the way and helped drive some of the market share gains you're seeing. Is it possible for you to quantify for us what impact your acquisitions have had on market share gains and how you are looking at acquisitions going forward?
Kevin March
Doug, actually I can't comment on that because I don't know the specific answer to that question. I'm sorry. It's clearly important to us in that most of these acquisitions that we've done are quite small and when we expose to the extent that becomes product mix [ph] exposure to our sales force, we find those very attractive because often times we can sell the product as fast enough to recover our purchase price and furnish our order, but beyond that to say how much it’s actually increased our market share gains, I’d be a bit hard to press, really articulate a number right now because I just don't know the answer to that.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company
Sure, if I could focus a little bit on what's happening with all the cash? You guys did a nice job of buying back some stock this quarter. Can you let us know is there is any change in thinking between buybacks and dividends and then also what your thoughts are on your hiring plan and if you could, what is your outlook for your own internal IT budgets?
Kevin March 
 I heard three questions in there, but I'll give…
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company
That's right.
Kevin March 
Yes, the multiple choice; you can pick your favorite.
Doug Freedman - Gleacher & Company
You didn't answer the first one.
Kevin March
Doug, on the cash, as you observed, we didn't pick up our buyback since last year. We bought back $500 million of shares in the first quarter and $750 million in the second quarter. As we've been doing – by the way, we have about $1.3 billion of unexpended authorization remaining. As we've done over the past few years to the extent that stock buybacks remain accretive that will be one way that we use cash, but really it’s important to note that the first priority for our cash is to just towards [ph] growth and that will be as you've been seeing us do either through acquisitions of companies, as we acquired in about a few moments ago, or opportunistic acquisition of capacity. And of course, the third way that we use the cash is in the form of when the Board approves to deliver back to shareholders in dividends. On the hiring front, I don't have any specific comments on that other than to say that as we bring on these factories, we've already talked about in the Richardson fab that several hundred people will hired to staff that fab as the equipment comes online, and we did mention in the acquisition announcement last week of the Spansion factories that we would hire almost all of the people that are there, that's 450 plus people that we'd hired there. And as to the IT budget, that's something my CIO would like to know and I'll talk to him about when we do annual plan times for next year.
Ron Slaymaker
So, we'll get back to you on that one, Doug. Kevin, let me ask you a question just on Spansion. So we have roughly 500 people that we may be have employees – that employed and we don't have output until sometime mid 2011 in terms of TI Analog product, how do we – I mean are those costs going to be a drag on TI profitability over the next year I guess is the question?
Kevin March 
We expect to be providing continuing transition services. Spansion is already supplying to a customer out of that factory and we expect to continue to do that while we're bringing our own manufacturing processes in there and to a large extent, we would anticipate those transition services would largely offset our carrying costs of that operation while we're bringing up our Analog processes.
Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Smigie of Raymond James.
Steven Smigie - Raymond James
I was hoping you could talk about the Analog a little bit here. In terms of the high volume Analog and logic, would you say that that is back to levels that you were at, at the peak, I’m just trying to understand what's driving the 50-ish percent type growth there, and how we should be thinking about that growth going forward?
Ron Slaymaker
Steve, I don’t -- off the top of my head, I don’t have the data on HVAL back to say second half, ’07 so I don’t know whether we’re -- how the comparison is as to how we moved back to peak levels. 
We certainly know we’ve moved very aggressively off of the -- off of, I would say the last five quarters. I think first quarter ’09 was when we saw that revenue bottom and it’s grown very nicely since then and we would say that represents really a turnaround of business. It’s not just -- I’ll call the cyclical bounce back in that revenue but in fact a lot of the things that we had been talking about really since I believe it was the May ’08 analyst meeting that we had done to restructure and create efficiencies in that business are in fact coming to fruition.
So again, that’s where we would declare it truly as a turnaround as opposed to a cyclical recovery and we do expect HVAL to continue really what you’ve seen over the last year, which is to grow consistent with the other two Analog businesses and contribute consistent with those -- with the overall analog revenue as opposed to the drag that it had been previously.
Do you have a follow on, Steve?
Steven J. Smigie - Raymond James
Yeah, if you could just -- how meaningful is the logic within that high-volume analog sales growth going back? Is it really the analog or is logical participating actually there and just -- I know you don’t give too much detail on the breakout, but is it meaningful, what’s in that HVA?
Ron Slaymaker
Yeah, I would describe it this way, it’s a relatively small part of that business overall. There is commodity, product and more in that area so we have -- I don’t want to say it’s not meaningful; certainly it’s meaningful although it’s a pretty small part of that HVAL business and even inside of that space, you would have to say there is a trend away from commoditization as they try to address more higher valued opportunities within there so it’s relatively small and getting smaller as a percent of the total from a logic perspective.
Okay Steve, thank you for your question and I think operator, we are going to have time for one additional caller and we’ll stop there.
Operator
And our next question comes from Tim Luke of Barclays Capital.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Thanks. Kevin, I was wondering if you guide up two to ten and bearing in mind that you saw some weakness at the end of the quarter in the wireless area. Are you expecting that to be broadly seasonal now, having seen the softness at the end of last quarter or how should we think about that?
Kevin March
Well, I think that Ron characterized earlier that if you take out last year seasonally, you might see 3Q grow to something like 5% in our forecast right now. The middle of our forecast is something like 6% right now so we’re probably in a round, seasonal kind of growth and honestly, it’s pretty broad based, it’s across all of our product lines, there’s no one area that we’re looking as being different from what we’d normally expect versus any other area right now.
Tim Luke - Barclays Capital
Thanks Ron. Just with respect to the regions, I was wondering if either of you had any color on how you had seen the order patterns from Europe develop as you’d gone through the quarter and if we begin to look at the third quarter -- obviously one recognizes that your capacity constraints have too much impact but can you give some color on what you’ve seen out of that region?
Ron Slaymaker
Tim, I don’t have data on the order patterns by regions but I do on revenue and what I would say specific to Europe is Europe grew pretty much the same pace as our revenue did overall so if there’s weakness to come, it’s still ahead of us. We did not see it at all in the second quarter. So again, Europe, revenue grew at the same pace as TI revenue did overall last quarter.
Okay Tim, thanks for your question and overall, thank you. We’re going to wrap up. Thank you for joining us. 
A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.
Operator
And this does conclude today’s conference call. We thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

Good day and welcome to Texas Instruments first quarter 2010 earnings call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ron Slaymaker. Please go ahead, sir.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Vivian. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI’s CFO, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through TI’s website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause TI’s results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI’s most recent SEC filings for a complete description. Our mid-quarter update to our outlook is scheduled this quarter for June 8th. We expect to narrow or adjust the revenue and earnings guidance ranges as appropriate with this update.
In today’s call, we will address TI’s plan for growth, we will talk about our progress to transform TI to a company-focused on Analog and Embedded Processing, how it’s driving our growth today, and our plans to support growth in the future. We’ll address near-term trends and inventories and lead-time, as well as our strategy for capacity to make sure we are positioned to grow in the years ahead.
Revenue in the first quarter slightly exceeded the high end of our range of expectations. Earnings landed at the top end of our expectations. Demand was strong and broad across end markets and regions, while supply chains across the electronics industry continue to be constrained, and inventories appear to remain lean.
Revenue in the quarter was up 7% sequentially and 54% compared with a year ago. Analog, Embedded Processing, and our core Wireless products, excluding baseband, were TI’s growth drivers in first quarter ’10 and we are investing to accelerate their growth from here. They received about 90% of our R&D investments in the first quarter. These businesses comprised 66% of our first quarter revenue, up from 61% a year ago and 58% in the first quarter of 2008.
Analog revenue grew 8% sequentially and was up 70% from the year-ago quarter. Once again, all three of our major analog product areas were strong contributors to this growth with each expanding about equally from its fourth quarter level. For HVAL, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of solid sequential growth further evidencing the turnaround in this business that we told you to expect and that is now being achieved.
A more important metric could be that our Analog revenue is up 8% compared with the third quarter of 2008, a quarter before the industry entered the downturn. While not all of our peers have reported, I believe this growth will compare favorably when results are in. The importance of this metric is that it captures performance a very longer period of time and indicates who is growing stronger out of the downturn.
We are working to extend our lead with investments we’ve made in product technology, sales support, and manufacturing capacity. Just last week, we bought another 100 tools for 300 millimeter analog production, taking off phase two of RFAB. Embedded Processing revenue grew 7% sequentially and was up 39% from a year ago. As a reminder, the year-ago quarter benefitted from growth in our communications infrastructure business, as China deployed 3G infrastructure.
The strongest areas of growth this quarter in both comparisons were in our catalog products that are used in a wide range of applications. Catalog microcontroller products were especially strong in the year-ago comparison. Similar to Analog, Embedded Processing revenue was up 3% from the third quarter of 2008, which should compare favorably to competitors.
Wireless revenue declined 5% sequentially and was up 27% from a year ago. Baseband revenue of $424 million fell 9% sequentially and was up 6% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger mix of 3G products. Basebands are now down to 13% of TI revenue compared with 15% in the fourth quarter and 19% in the year-ago quarter. Revenue of $293 million collectively from applications processors and connectivity products was even with the fourth quarter and was up 80% from a year ago. This was up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2008, another indication of our strong performance in the smartphone market.
I should note that we have moved our low-power wireless product from our Analog segment to our Wireless segment. We made this move because the wireless organization is better suited to support the significant growth opportunity. This low-power wireless product line is based on products that were included in or subsequently developed from our 2006 acquisition of Chipcon. Revenue from these products was $68 million in 2009. We have a chart on our website that shows our Analog and Wireless segments historically adjusted for this change.
Other revenue grew by 19% sequentially. Royalties increased, and we had a strong sequential growth in custom ASIC products as well as growth in DLP products and calculators. From a year ago, Other revenue grew 68%, mostly due to strong growth in DLP products where revenue more than doubled as well as strengthened loyalties, custom ASIC products and calculators.
From a geographical perspective, almost all of the sequential revenue growth came from the US, Asia-Pacific, and Japan regions.
Turning to distribution, re-sales or sales out of our distribution channel were up more than 10% sequentially. We believe this represents share gains across multiple distributors. Even with the strong resale growth, we were able to help distributors build some inventories to support future growth. Even so, distributors’ total weeks of inventory remain about five, similar to last quarter and low by historical standards.
Now Kevin will review profitability and our outlook.
Kevin March
Thanks, Ron. And good afternoon, everyone. Our gross profit expanded by 6% sequentially this quarter, as revenue grew. Gross margin declined slightly by 20 basis points to 52.7% of revenue. Operating expenses increased $27 million from the fourth quarter. As I explained in January, this was mostly the result of higher compensation expenses that resulted from our stronger financial outlook for 2010. For example, accruals for employee profit sharing and annual raises in February.
Operating expenses were 23% of revenue in the quarter within our planned operating models. Restructuring charges in the first quarter were $10 million. This was for US pension plan settlement accounting associated with actions that occurred in 2008 and 2009. The distribution of these charges across our segments is included in our earnings release.
Operating profit for the quarter was $950 million, 9% higher than the prior quarter due to higher gross profit. From the year-ago quarter, operating profit was up $940 million due to higher gross profit. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.7% of revenue.
Net income in the first quarter was $658 million or $0.52 per share. Included in net income was $7 million of discreet tax charges that were associated with the change in tax treatment of Medicare retiree growth subsidies. I’ll leave most of the cash flow and balance sheet items for you to review in the release. However, let me make just a few comments.
Cash flow from operations was $710 million. This was down from the last quarter’s $1 billion due to higher receivables. Cash flow from operations was up in the year-ago quarter due to higher net income. Capital expenditures declined sequentially to $219 million in the quarter. Expenditures included the purchase of additional assembly and test equipment as well as additional analog wafer fab equipment.
Our process qualification work at our 300 millimeter analog wafer fab, RFAB, is producing good results. The initial wafers that we began producing in January have completed processing with good early yields. We continue to track well to our goal in our full process production qualification before the end of this year. In the quarter, we used $504 million to repurchase 20.6 million shares of TI common stock and pay dividends of $149 million.
We were able to increase our inventory by $74 million in the quarter with most of the additional inventories stages as work in process to support our forecasted higher 2Q revenue. Inventory days held steady at 76. Consistent with what we described in our mid-quarter update, our delivery performance has continued to improve and our lead-times have continued to decline, as we bring additional manufacturing capacity online and get better positioned with inventory.
Even as we have begun an orderly process of reducing lead-times, demand from our customers has remained strong. Orders in the quarter were $3.64 billion, up 12% sequentially. TI’s book-to-bill ratio was 1.14 in the quarter, up from 1.08 in the fourth quarter and our strongest book-to-bill ratio since the second quarter of last year.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.31 billion to $3.59 billion in the second quarter or 3% to 12% sequential growth. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of 56 –
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. We will continue with where Kevin left up there.
Kevin March
Actually what I’ll do is back up maybe a paragraph. I’m sure that’s caused a bit of distraction for everybody.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.31 billion to $3.59 billion in the second quarter, or 3% to 12% sequential growth. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.64. Our estimates for 2010 R&D, depreciation, and capital expenditures are unchanged from last quarter.
In summary, as the recovery continues to gain momentum, we are seeing the results from investments that we maintained even through the depths of the downturn. We have products well positioned, and field sales and applications team is second to none. Our production output is at an all-time high, and we have a multi-year ramp in capacity underway that will allow us to support our customers and therefore our shareholders with strong growth potential. And this capacity, both fab and assembly or test, is being procured at cost levels that will also advantage us competitively without burdening TI with a lot of fixed costs. We see this strategy as having lots of upside opportunity and manageable downside risk.
With that, let me turn it back to Ron.
Ron Slaymaker
Thanks, Kevin. While we are building the queue for Q&A, let me take a moment to remind you that we will be holding our 2009 Financial Analyst Meeting in New York next Thursday, May 6, starting at 2:00 PM Eastern Time. The meeting will be webcast. So if you are able to join us in person, pleased join the webcast.
Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we will provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?
"
2010-04-27,Q&A," Session
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Slaymaker. (Operator instructions) And we will take our first question from Christopher Danely with JP Morgan.
Ron Slaymaker
Chris, are you there? Operator, why don’t we move to the next caller and we will come back to Chris? Operator, are we still online?
Operator
Yes, sir. One moment please. And Mr. Danely, please go ahead, sir.
Christopher Danely – JP Morgan
Can you guys hear me?
Ron Slaymaker
We can hear you now, Chris.
Christopher Danely – JP Morgan
All right. Thanks. First question is on the gross margins, why were the gross margins down despite the increase in sales? And can you just maybe give us a sense of where gross margins can go for the rest of the year?
Kevin March
Yes, Chris, you may recall that in January when we had our fourth quarter earnings release and our first quarter call, I mentioned that we were reinstating compensation changes – compensation increases for everybody in 2010 and that we also based upon our higher outlook, we see related compensation such as profit sharing going up. And so really what you are seeing is the effect of that going through the gross margins line. In fact, if you adjust for that, the fall-through would be very closely better than expected it.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Chris?
Christopher Danely – JP Morgan
If you could just talk about where you can expect gross margins to trend for the rest of the year, i.e., can they go up much or will the compensation continue to impact?
Kevin March
Yes, we’ve established a gross margins target of 55% gross margin and 30% operating margin. And we remain very confident being able to achieve those. The main driver of that of course is going to be just the revenue mix, as we go forward. I think Ron mentioned already that Analog and Embedded Processing and the core Wireless Products are now about 66% of our total revenue that become a richer mix in most and a very nice gross margins. We would expect that mix to continue to richen up as we go through the year and the years follow, and the gross margins will move up accordingly. Beyond that, I won’t really give a specific time period as to when we think we will be achieving that 55% gross.
Ron Slaymaker
Kevin, could you speak just a minute on the compensation, how much of what we saw from fourth to first with kind of a one-time moving into the New Year versus what we just expected quarter-to-quarter going forward?
Kevin March
Yes, that’s a good point, Ron. The compensation changes that you saw in the first quarter, our annual raises are actually effective from February. So we saw two-thirds of the effect of that in the quarter. So we’ll see a bit more of that going into second quarter where the total rate will burden the quarter. And just on our outlook, our accruals that we take for other compensation for other compensation-related incentive type things such as profit sharing to be adjusted as well.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you, Chris. And let’s move to the next caller, please.
Operator
And we will go next to Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.
Tristan Gerra – Robert Baird
Hi, good afternoon. Sounds like your utilization rates went up in Q1, which I think maybe above the flattish expectation you had last quarter? And also if you could talk about your expectation in Q2 relative to your capacity ramps.
Kevin March
Yes. Tristan, our utilization rate really didn’t move that much. It was very consistent what we talk about. While we do expect utilization go up a little bit next quarter, it’s going to be that much again. We have – you may have noticed from our balance sheet, we are able to build some inventory in the first quarter even with our utilization not changing by that much. That helps position us well for growth going into the second quarter. And so we have just a small – relatively small additional wafer starts, we will be able to reach those types of revenue numbers that we gave in the guidance.
Ron Slaymaker
And Tristan, we don’t really have expectations that we are sharing on our second quarter utilization as that will really tie more to our third quarter expectations. Do have a follow-on, Tristan?
Tristan Gerra – Robert Baird
Also, given your expectation to face up the baseband business, are you changing your pricing strategy there or is it pretty much in line with what you’ve done in the past and perhaps also some pricing comments on the analog side of the business?
Ron Slaymaker
Tristan, I really don’t have comments on baseband pricing. Again, most of our pricing there tends to be driven more by longer-term contracts, but since most of our baseband revenue really goes to a single customer, it would be inappropriate for us to talk about pricing trend. With respect to analog, really no abnormal changes there. I think the analog pricing, in general, especially in the high performance area tends to be very stable.
And in areas like HVAL where it may tend to trend down over time, it tends to trend down based upon longer-term pricing agreements, and those are well understood trends that we engineer for. If I can broaden that, the only area where we have seen pricing that moves more with the near-term market environment would be on the commodity areas. And we’ve set pricing last quarter so that pricing has trended up. And in fact, we saw that as well in the first quarter. Okay, Tristan. Thank you. And let’s move to the next caller please.
Operator
We will go next to Adam Benjamin with Jefferies. Please check your mute function, Mr. Benjamin. Okay. We will go next to Uche Orji with UBS.
Uche Orji – UBS
Thank you very much. Can you hear me?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, we can, Uche.
Uche Orji – UBS
Ron, just one quick question, Ron. I mean, when you look at your revenue growth in the last three or four quarters, which have been fairly strong, and we try to consolidate with the ultimate end market, be it industrial, be it wireless. Are you concerned at all that inventory might be (inaudible) down the line with the OEMs. I mean, it just seems to be – evidently, you kind of categorize this yourself and try to figure out why this is happening, because that seems to be little bit of a disconnect with the stress [ph] we have seen with the component growth as of the end market themselves?
Kevin March
Uche, I guess the advice I would have in doing that comparison is, you can’t have the starting point be in the last three or four quarters, because in the first half of last year, especially first quarter of last year and probably even starting at fourth quarter ’08 as the downturn really started to take force, we were significantly under-shipping our customers, as they were reducing inventory. So, to look at growth trends coming off of that bottom when we were under-shipping customers is probably not an appropriate metric. I do believe that – first of all, let’s talk about the customer inventory.
You heard us say first of all with respect to distribution, our channel inventory. We were able to get some inventory built there, but weeks of inventory maintained at about five, which is by any historical metric point to be lean. We have an additional significant percentage of our OEM customers where we are managing their component inventory because it’s business that’s done on a consignment basis. And we know that it’s lean, and it tends to be very productive fab-turning inventory. So if you put distribution and the OEM consignment programs together, that represents about two-thirds of TI’s revenue base. So that leaves about one-third of the customers that we have, frankly, less direct visibility into their inventory level. But Uche, all signs and indications that we pick up is that inventories remain lean.
As I said, this is a general supply chain type of consideration that inventories are lean. The customers are trying to build inventory and bring in products consistent with our end demand. But they are really not to a point where they have been able to significantly increase inventory from the days or weeks basis. So certainly we watch it, we watch relative growth, we talk to customers about their needs and all of that. But we haven’t seen anything to this point that is setting off any kind of alarm. In fact, if anything, we are still the other way around where we are trying to continue to pull up our supply to be able to fully meet the customer’s demand with the service levels that they are used to from TI. Okay. Uche, do you have a follow-on?
Uche Orji – UBS
Yes, I do actually. Thanks for the answer. My follow-on is, if I look at the other revenues, that seems to be a very meaningful contributor to margins. I mean, one of the key contributors there of course is the royalties. Can you give us any comments as to what’s driving royalties at the moment? What – if you don’t give us the actual size of that number, but just to get a sense of what’s driving royalties right now. I know you started to deal with DRAM companies, and what the acquisitions are. And also within DLP, if you can also talk about what the acquisitions are within that? That’s my last question. Thank you.
Kevin March
Uche, I think on the royalty front, naturally that’s a function of how well our licensees are doing. And in general, we’ve got a strong market going on. I will quantify any of the business units underneath the Other segment other than to say what’s up and what’s down. Royalties was up sequentially. DLP was also up quite a bit. That also happens to be a very attractive margin business. And that’s on the strength of projectors. In fact, not only quarter-over-quarter, but also year-over-year, if I recall, I believe it doubled on a year-over-year basis.
And going forward, we are seeing continued strong demand, especially for the DLP into the future. Again, not being specific on that area because we don’t really forecast – forecast below the company level. Overall, what we will see next quarter just so it’s not lost on folks, as we calculate our business, it’s inside the Other segment. And you may recall, that has a seasonally stronger second and third quarter that’s when the back-to-school selling season happens. And so we will typically see an uptick from 1Q to 2Q for that business, and we are expecting about $65 million to both 1Q and 2Q in terms of revenue there, typically go up a little bit in the third quarter and then drop off again in the fourth due to the seasonal nature of that business.
Ron Slaymaker
Uche –
Uche Orji – UBS
Thank you very much.
Ron Slaymaker
Yes. Let me make a couple comments also just on what’s driving that DLP strength, because certain part of it is the year-ago effect of markets being weak in inventory. But actually inside of DLP, education is a very big market driver for our front projector products. And we are seeing a lot of strength now, especially for example in Asia, as schools and classrooms over there start deploying DLP projectors and the classrooms similar to what may a difficult year had done. And DLP has a very significant reliability advantage that makes it attractive to educational systems.
The other thing that is more recently starting to play out is a differentiator for our DLP front projectors is they are 3D capable. And so you certainly know about 3D and the cinema, but actually educational systems are using a 3D capability to help students better visualize things that wouldn’t normally pop out in tech books or in 2D diagrams. And then certainly, you don’t have to look very far to realize how big 3D is with movie cinemas these days. And what I would just say is almost all of that is being done on TI-based DLP projectors. Okay Uche, thank you for your questions, and we’ll move to the next caller.
Operator
We’ll go next to Shawn Webster with Macquarie.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie
Yes, thank you. Can you hear me?
Ron Slaymaker
Yes, sir.
Shawn Webster – Macquarie
Okay, yes. I was wondering – you said that five weeks wasn’t – was still lean. What is that historically? And in terms of your lead-times, when do you think they will be going to a more normal level?
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. The historical distribution has one in the eight to nine weeks range, and that’s over the past few years, maybe excluding last year. But if we go back longer – if we go back further in history, they would have even carried more weeks of inventory. Certainly, part of the reason that inventory levels have come down are just structure things that we’ve done from a consignment program. And just as a refresher today, we actually started, I guess it was in June of 2008, pulling consignment programs to distribution. Today about 30% of our distribution revenue is supported by consignment. So structurally, that will tend to bring down inventory levels. But even accounting for that inventory levels, distributors remain lean. And Kevin, do you – would you like to answer the second?
Kevin March
On lead-times, Ron mentioned during the mid-quarter earnings conference call that we have already begun to pull in lead-times, as we’ve been bringing on capacity to deal with the high levels of demand that we’ve had. And we have further programs, as we came out of the quarter. We still have a number of products that have been kind of longer than we prefer at this point that we bring significant progress coming to the first quarter. And remind me that we are going to continue installing additional capacity for each of the quarters of 2010, and we expect that should greatly enable our ability to bring new accounts back to the normal level.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, Shawn?
Shawn Webster – Macquarie
Yes, please. I was just wondering if you could provide us some color on how your order books looking going into Q2, what areas do you expect strength from, and what area do you expect the least growth?
Kevin March
Shawn, we don’t break our guidance down into particular markets. So I probably need to stay away from that. However, let me just say, thus far in the quarter, which is what, 26 days, orders are strong and fully consistent with the guidance that we just provided to you.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Shawn, thank you. And we’ll move to the next caller.
Operator
We’ll go next to Tore Svanberg with Thomas Weisel Partners.
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners
Yes. First of all, just going back to the lead-time topic, can you just put some parameters or numbers around where lead-times have been and where they are now?
Kevin March
We are talking about tens of thousands of part number series. There really is no one answer, but lead-times that were, say, in excess of 12 weeks, total back in to the eight to 10-week kind of range. Lead-times that were in excess of 16 and pulling back into the 12, 14 kind of range, it kind of seems across the board where unfortunately more and more of our products are moving back into a normal lead-time for that particular product, not all the saying that depends on the manufacturing process. Some process would take longer naturally than other processes. But the lead-times are all beginning to move back in consistent with those processes. But as I said, there is still some work to do on that that should be dealt with as new capacity continues to come online this year.
Ron Slaymaker
Hey, Tore. One way of thinking about it, I guess at mid-quarter, we were seeing data that allowed us to believe they had stabilized. And I think I described as we were making slight improvements in lead-times. Since then we’ve seen a lot of progress. And I would describe – compared to slight improvements at mid-quarter, I would describe the improvement as significant at this point. So they have turned. They have turned very clearly in the right direction, and we are making significant progress. Do you have a follow-on, Tore?
Tore Svanberg – Thomas Weisel Partners
Yes, one. You said the HVAL bases has grown four consecutive quarters and has fully recovered. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the bigger end markets that have been responsible for that recovery, please?
Kevin March
Yes. The only thing I would say is, I don’t know what I would say if fully recovered. I think we certainly believe we have it well on a path and we think the turnaround that we had talked about, I think, really for a couple of years now is well underway. But there are still – there is still work to do. There is still additional progress to be made in terms of further diversification of those products in the markets that we are working through. I think if you look at HVAL, really isn’t a single market, a variety markets. It’s even specific to first quarter, clearly computing and peripherals that we participate in with those products would include areas like printers, but maybe more significantly would be hard disk drive. Those were some examples. Probably automotive would be another one that I would mention as a notable area of improvement.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Tore. Thank you. And we’ll move to next caller please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Adam Benjamin with Jefferies.
Ron Slaymaker
Hello, Adam. Welcome back.
Adam Benjamin – Jefferies
Thanks, guys. Sorry for the snap though. Just had a follow-up on the lead-times, with the lead-times coming in on the back end mostly, can you talk a little bit about cancellations that you’ve seen maybe on a relative basis in Q4 and then comparing that to Q1 and then what you’ve seen so far in this quarter?
Kevin March
Adam, I can answer that pretty quickly. We’ve seen no change in lead-times. There is no abnormal cancellation. Pardon me. No change in cancellations. We will have no more adjustments there at all. In fact, I would just observe it during the quarter, even though we were improving the lead-times on a considerable basis, but again we did see (inaudible) orders in the quarter. We talked about earlier that book-to-bill (inaudible) 1.14. So really showing that customers continue to have significant demand for our products.
Ron Slaymaker
I think – to be honest there, I know there has been a lot of investor and analyst concern and worry about what will happen when lead-times pour in and what – how that might affect orders. But beyond that, I think that kind of focus really is missing the force for the three. In this type of very strong demand environment. So was there any noise in the order line associated with our changing lead-times? There could have been, but it was more than plump by just rising in demand, rising production from our customers. So again, I just – I would caution against getting to micro-focused on that detail and focus more on just the recovering economy and what that’s driving in terms of demand for semiconductors. Adam, do you have a follow-on?
Adam Benjamin – Jefferies
Let me just follow up kind of on a longer term basis on gross margin, I know in this quarter you mentioned you’re layering on some comp and some CapEx. And I’m just curious if you move throughout this year and really into next year how you’re thinking about the gross margin and where we should be thinking about where that can trend to?
Kevin March
Adam, we’ve been talking for a couple years now about gross margins working their way as we rebuild the portfolio to a 55% kind of structure. And that’s not to say that the ceiling of our floors to say that our portfolio should be able to deliver that on a fairly reliable basis. Going forward, we continue to be even more confident that we will be in those kind of gross margins, especially as we see analog and embedded processing becoming a bigger mix of our revenue overall.
On the CapEx front, we’ve talked for a while about CapEx probably running in the 5% to 8% kind of range – percent of revenue. And in fact, we are consistent with that. I was just looking over some data this morning, and our capital spending for the last 12 months has been almost exactly 8% of revenue, which bodes well for depreciation as we move forward also. So we should see depreciation throughout – on the gross margin. In addition to that, we’ve been acquiring capital at extremely attractive prices. So we are getting more capacities than we would normally get dollar-for-dollar of capital spend, which bodes very well for being able to grow our top line, which is where we are highly focused inside the company is driving top line growth at this point as opposed to trying to adjust the gross margin models.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you, Adam. And let’s move to the next caller please.
Operator
We will go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thanks guys so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. If we look forward the 300 millimeter fab getting ramped up, how quickly do you think realistically you could gain some kind of meaningful share coming out of that fab?
Kevin March
Jim, the schedule right now is for them to be shipping its first production worth product by the end of this year. We – as Ron mentioned, we just started Phase II expansion in that factory. The Phase I was to give us $1 billion of incremental revenue capacity. That’s what we announced a couple quarters ago. Phase two is a second $1 billion of revenue capacity, and we have just begun bringing equipment – just purchased equipment last week to support that, and we will be bringing that in very quickly. We would expect to probably have some fairly meaningful revenue begin to come out of there in 2011.
Ron Slaymaker
On that second phase offer?
Kevin March
Yes.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. All right. Jim, do you have a follow-on?
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs
I’ll stay on that. When do we think the first phase would be complete? I understand you will ship product in the fourth quarter, but when would that phase one be kind of fully ramped?
Ron Slaymaker
Jim, that’s going to be a functional demand I guess. Kevin would like to really forecast all the way out to the end of 2011 as to when each of those pieces of machines would be fully utilized, but they will certainly be ready to be fully utilized as we come out of this year and go into next year.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs
Okay, okay. So sometime early in 2011 then?
Kevin March
Generally available and we just wait for the orders.
Ron Slaymaker
Great, better. Thank you, Jim.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs
Thank you.
Ron Slaymaker

Operator
And we will go next to Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.
Srini Pajjuri – CLSA
Thank you. Kevin, a couple of questions. One, on accounts receivable, it went up a bit in the quarter. Given the tightness. I would have expected it to remain flat or actually come down a bit. If you can give us a bit more color to what’s going on there/
Kevin March
Yes. In the fourth quarter, what typically happens on our shipments in the fourth quarter are actually a drop off a fair amount in December, as customers put their factories on holiday and so on. And so our receivables will tend to decline and our days of receivables will tend to go down. Coming out of fourth quarter into first, we are back into a more normal manufacturing environment with our customers, more uniform factory loadings and full hour shipments are more uniform across the quarter, which in turn by contrast to fourth quarter range of receivables levels up when your revenue grows and you wind up your days going up as well. If you look on a year-over-year basis, actually very consistent on these bases.
Ron Slaymaker
Just relative linearity between fourth quarter and first quarter shipments.
Kevin March
Right.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Srini, do you have a follow-on?
Srini Pajjuri – CLSA
Yes, Ron. On the pricing front, Ron, you mentioned that you are seeing some beneficial pricing on the commodity side. Now that the leads times are coming in, do we expect any changes to pricing? I mean, do you expect the prices to kind of revert to the normal declines. And if so, what kind of impact should we have to expect on the gross margin? Thank you.
Kevin March
Srini, I really don’t want to try to forecast what commodity pricing might be. This is an area where first sometime I think since it’s really the beginning of the year, we have actually been on a what we call, controlled order entry process where customers just could not come in and place unlimited demand on us based upon a certain lead-time. We provide certain levels of support to customers that have been historic customers. And if competitors were having issues supplying product, we weren’t just going to be the benefactor for all of their customers to be able to gain support.
So commodity really has been kind of a different environment for the last few quarters, very difficult for this part with this kind of market environment in terms of how we and how our competitors move to a controlled order entry process. But the statements about lead-time reductions and such have not yet applied to those commodity products. That was more statements about general products in a better processing, high performance analog power, HVAL, those types of product areas.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Srini. Thanks for your questions. And we’ll move to the next caller.
Operator
We’ll go next to Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.
Sumit Dhanda – Banc of America Securities/Merrill Lynch
Yes, hi, guys. My first question, Kevin, you talked about OpEx going up and some impact to your cost line from higher compensation. A question on operating margins wise segment, it seems like that trend may have impacted all of your segments, but your Other segments. I was wondering what is special there. Was it just that royalty saw a bit uptick relative to everything else in the quarter?
Kevin March
Well, the Other segment actually doesn’t have none of the staffing level that you see in the three primary segments. And so there is not that much compensation to run through there compared to the other ones. And then again we have just very high margin kind of cash cow items, if you will, that are in that segment. And so dollar-for-dollar they tend to fall through quite rich, but really it’s going to come down to – you just don’t have as much compensation inside that segment that’s going to see the changes that we saw in the Other segment.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on to that?
Sumit Dhanda – Banc of America Securities/Merrill Lynch
Yes, I do have one. I know you refrained from commenting specifically on your baseband business into the second quarter. But just overall in terms of the year – do you expect the trends to be largely seasonal, better growth in 3G, offset by maybe some erosion in your hedge business? How should we think about it big picture basis?
Kevin March
Yes. Maybe if I can even move beyond this year, you’ve heard us say for some time and we’ll say it again today that we expect our baseband revenue to be essentially zero by the end of 2012. So if you take our first quarter baseband revenue of $424 million, $425 million and trade line that to zero at the end of 2012, I think what you are going to find is there will likely be quarters above this line and quarters below the line. The exact profile of the decline is going to depend upon our customers’ success in the market and the mix of their 3G versus older technologies, as well as our customers – I'm sorry, our competitors’ progress in delivering baseband product to meet the customers’ needs. So maybe some additional color that can help you to your own analysis on this is if you consider that today 3G baseband represent about 75% of our baseband revenue. And that’s up from about 50% a year ago as the market really has transitioned to these more advanced technologies.
I think it’s well known that our largest customer is intending to multi-source their baseband. And I think what you can expect in 2010 is that competitors should begin to support the older technologies that represented 25% of our baseband revenue in the first quarter. And for 3G, we don’t anticipate competitors to begin ramping new products there until sometime in 2011. So our revenue profile this year in 2010 is going to depend on how the competitive incursions compare against the ongoing market shift to 3G and also how our customer performs in that 3G market. So hopefully that provides you some level of insight. Okay. Thanks for your questions. And we will move to the next caller, please.
Operator
We will go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
Steve Smigie – Raymond James
Great. Thanks, guys. I’m not sure if I missed it, but could you – if you’ve already discussed the mix of high performance in power versus HVAL within analog?
Kevin March
We didn’t specifically break that out, Steve, nor do we – the only – we kind of do more on an annual basis. Think about last year, it was a mix of 30% HPA, 30% power, and the remaining 40% within the HVAL. But we don’t provide quarter-by-quarter updates there. Do you have a follow-on, Steve?
Steve Smigie – Raymond James
Yes. Could you just at least give some color within HPA, what may be driving – I'm assuming that’s up since we are rolling on up 7%. What product types are just generally driving that? Is it amplifiers, is it converters, et cetera? Just on a percentage basis, give us just color on what’s wrong with that?
Kevin March
Yes, sure. From product standpoint, you named several of them there, operational amplifiers, data converters, and then also in the first quarter, industrial interface products or the areas that grew fast sequentially. And our high performance analog business, price similar to lot of the other HPA players that you’ve seen out there, really has a pretty strong exposure to the industrial market and is benefiting as the industrial market continues to have a pretty robust recovery here. So those product areas that I mentioned but didn’t offer maybe more aligned with industrial market overall.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Steve. Thanks for your questions. And we will move to the next caller.
Operator
We will go next to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
Hi, guys. Ron, just first a little clarification. You said in your baseband business, 3G was 75% and 50% last year. Did you mean last year as in the first quarter of last year or the entirety of last year?
Ron Slaymaker
First quarter of 2009. So first quarter 2009, 50%, and first quarter 2010 has migrated to 75%.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
Do you have a kind of an average of what it was for the full year?
Ron Slaymaker
No, but I’ll get to somewhere between those two numbers. Sorry, I don’t have that data in front of me.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
That’s probably a pretty good guess. The follow-on question, shifting gears to the order book, I know guys – the duration of those orders can be three or six-month orders depending upon the type of customer. Has your lead-time being pulled in started to be visible in the duration of orders that people are placing, three-month versus six-month?
Kevin March
I would suggest that with a 1.14 book-to-bill and a growth rate that we are suggesting probably will consume all those orders next quarter. You can pretty assume, Ross, that we are still seeing some orders in the north of three months kind of window. Nothing north of six months. We just don’t recognize orders that far out. But probably a good portion of those in the three to six-month range. I don’t have the exact breakout, but that would be my expectation.
Ross Seymore – Deutsche Bank
Okay, thank you.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, Ross, thank you. And we’ll move to the next caller.
Operator
We’ll go next to Glen Yeung with Citi.
Glen Yeung – Citi
Maybe just following up on that last question, when you guys are getting orders now, are you going through a process of scrubbing those for anything you think may be kind of questionable order, and if your process any different now than may it has been in the past?
Ron Slaymaker
Glen, probably this is real simple. The process is the same as it has been for the last few quarters now. And so we are looking very closely at each order coming in and making sure that we are meeting true demand, what the customer needs to keep their lines up.
Glen Yeung – Citi
Okay, thanks for that, Kevin. And then my follow-up is on capacity growth. Are you guys able to quantify how much capacity you are bringing on maybe in 8-inch equivalent, let’s say, by the end of this calendar year? And then can you compare that point to where you were at, say, the end of 2008, i.e., are you above your ‘08 amount of capacity or below?
Kevin March
Glen, I don’t have those numbers. Certainly we talked about on the 300 millimeter the incremental revenue that that will give us. And we have talked about purchasing and deploying 200 millimeter equipment last year and more this year, but frankly, I don’t have the numbers for you to give you any further answer on that.
Ron Slaymaker
We are clearly adding capacity. I think you saw, I believe it was in the release, every quarter of this year of – the starting point is production now for the first quarter is higher than it’s ever been and our capacity increases sequentially every quarter, as we move through 2010.
Glen Yeung – Citi
Maybe just to clarify that, was there some capacity decline from your peak capacity levels in ’08?
Kevin March
No, we did not take any factories offline. The other factory we’ve taken offline in the last couple of years has been KFAB. And we’ve redeployed that. That was back in early ’07. And then there was an older factory that we had acquired with the Burr-Brown acquisition in Tucson that we also ran down in the early ’08 time frame. But during the downturn we took no capacity offline. In fact, we’ve added in the capacity.
Glen Yeung – Citi
Okay. All right, thanks.
Ron Slaymaker
Thank you, Glen. Next caller please.
Operator
We’ll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse
Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Kevin, if you guys hit the high end of your June guidance, you will start to see revenue that you saw make in sort of the December ’07 time period. But gross margins are actually going to be down a little bit from that December ’07 quarter. And I guess given that the mix has moved dramatically more towards analog, I’m just trying to figure out how we should think about that?
Kevin March
John, I don’t have the data in front of me from that time period back there. And I’m not quite sure how you are modeling the gross margin assumption. I would just remind you that the OpEx will be up a little bit though again next quarter, as I mentioned earlier, on our full quarter’s overall compensation change. So I don’t know how you are squeezing that through your model, but you should take note of that. But beyond that, I don’t have the data in front of me for that time frame in 2007. So I can’t respond to you well on that.
Ron Slaymaker
Do you have a follow-on, John?
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse
Yes. My follow-up, as we think about 300 millimeters coming online, how do we model that from a gross margin perspective? Is it just incremental depreciation or will you guys go through a couple quarters of kind of sub-optimal yields if we need to kind of work into the model?
Kevin March
Clearly, as we are ramping about, even as we speak, we are ramping up now. We are experiencing a cost there because everything that we are doing there is not inventory (inaudible) just being expensed. The way to think about the economics on that is, generally speaking, the die cost would be about 30% less than what the equivalent die would be on a 200 millimeter wafer. On LL parts, about 50% of your cost is in die and 50% is in the assembly or test. So you will get probably about 15% kind of manufacturing cost reduction in the apples-to-apples comparison to 8-inch. That’s really at the product level. And so as we look at turning that into analog revenue coming out of that factor, I think you can kind of model those numbers out and figure out the incremental gross margin, we will get out of that factory.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay, John. Thanks for your question.
John Pitzer – Credit Suisse

We’ll go next to Doug Freedman with Broadpoint.
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint
Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Ron, you offered some great detail on the ramp-down on the Wireless business in the baseband side. Can you actually talk more about what’s happening on the business that you are keeping, that the apps processors and the connectivity and what you expectations are for that business throughout the year and into next year?
Ron Slaymaker
I don’t have a specific forecast for you, but let me just say, it’s tied to a smartphone market where we believe you probably have smartphones growing on the order of 40% unit growth this year compared to last year. So being in a rapidly growing market is always a good thing. And then secondly, a thoughtful expectation that over the course of time we want to continue taking market share there across all the applications, processors, as well as the connectivity products. So it’s a combination. The strategy, as you might guess, is very attractive market in terms of growth, which is why we’ve centered up our wireless investment in that space and then also playing from the strength of our position and our technology with the OMAP applications processor.
And then a lot of connectivity right now is a lot of integration of multiple connectivity technologies into pure chip, both for power consumption and cost. And we are absolutely leading that integration. I think near-term on OMAP, the growth driver will be just the deployment of OMAP 3, which is our latest production part, and soon to be followed up with OMAP 4, as you might guess. So we’ve got a good pipeline of technologies, and we have a great pipeline of design wins. OMAP 3 will be ramping more than 50 design wins over the course of the next – over the next year into production, and we think that points to a very attractive growth opportunity. Do you have a follow-on, Doug?
Doug Freedman – Broadpoint
Yes. That’s great color. Thank you, Ron. Kevin, for you, on the OpEx side, you keep mentioning your target model 55% and 30% for the operating margins. That would imply 25% OpEx spending. You are actually running under that. Are we going to get ourselves in trouble here thinking that it’s based at the present percentages, or should we be modeling that percentage to come back up? Then follow-on to that is, what is your present plan for use of cash and your fab ratios?
Kevin March
Doug, on the OpEx, we are mindful of computing that OpEx percent with baseband removed. We know it’s going to be going to zero at some point. And so when you do that, we’re actually at about 26%. So we will continue to be very disciplined in how we manage the OpEx for the foreseeable future. As to the use of cash, you’ve seen us over the last few years using cash flow (inaudible) and dividend increases. I can’t make any specific forecast on those – on dividend increase of course because they are subject to Board approval. But as we continue to generate cash, we first try to deploy it internally for growth and to the extent that we’ve deployed as much as we can effectively growth with, then we will continue to do buyback and also continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. I don’t have a specific payout ratio for you that tried to model in or (inaudible) communicate right now.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thanks, Doug. And we’ll move to the next caller, please.
Operator
We’ll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein
Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just one question on the operating margins by business units. The core business is the non-Other stuff they all compressed. Embedded compressed quite a bit differently than the others. It was down about 500 basis points versus about 100 to 200 basis points for Analog and Wireless. Can you give me some feeling for – were the compensation increases and OpEx increases by business unit about the same? And what does that imply for the gross margins of those individual businesses and the change in those gross margins out of this quarter?
Kevin March
Really the biggest thing is we’ve got to kind of carefully look at us, Stacy, is we are still redeploying internally. I think Ron mentioned in his remarks that about 90% of our total R&D is now going towards three growth areas, the Analog, Embedded Processing, and the non-baseband portion of Wireless. That transition has been underway for really very aggressively during 2009, but even started earlier than that. So what you’re seeing on a quarter-over-quarter basis is a little bit more just to redeploy it. Again, some of that is coming out of the Other segment, going into Embedding Processing and so on. We’ve also stepped up our staffing level there quite a bit in the sales that you accelerate the opportunities we see, especially in the microcontroller space with the 32-bit opportunities that we see emerging on that side.
Ron Slaymaker
Kevin, I think you had a lot of TI employees listening very carefully to how you are going to answer that question. Stacy, do you have a follow-on?
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein
Got it. Yes, I do. Around the phase two for the 300 millimeter, can you give me a feeling for – you bought 100 tools. Is that how complete is the purchase for phase two? Can you give me a feeling for I guess the degree of discount you are getting for this equipment versus what you paid for phase one? I think phase one was, what, $173 million for the full 13,000 wafers per month?
Kevin March
Yes. Phase one actually supports part of phase two also by the way. One of the things that phase two is really good is on line balancing for us. So we spend about $75 million on those 200 – on those 100 tools that we mentioned earlier. And we will be needing to acquire some more tools to complete phase two. Overall, spending will probably be below what we spent on phase one, but that’s really because of your line balancing. And what I mean by that is some of the phase one equipment can support more than just incremental $1 billion of revenue we’ve been talking about. It supports into the $2 billion number. But without some of the line balancing equipment that phase two starts bringing and you really can’t get that kind of fruit. So that’s what you are seeing happening here. And our cost for that equipment so far in phase two has been quite similar to what we saw in phase one.
Stacy Rasgon – Sanford Bernstein
Got it. Thank you, guys.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. Thank you, Stacy. So, Kevin, what you just said was that the phase two – put it this way. The equipment purchase requirement for our second billion dollars of revenue at our fab should be less than what was required for phase one, which was the first billion dollars. Is that correct?
Kevin March
Right.
Ron Slaymaker
Okay. All right. And operator, we’re going to move to our final questioner here.
Operator
And we will go to Tim Luke with Barclays.
Tim Luke – Barclays
Hi (inaudible).
Ron Slaymaker
I didn’t know of you, Tim. (inaudible) go ahead.
Tim Luke – Barclays
Okay. Obviously you were successful in building a bit of inventory in the quarter. In the first quarter, are you thinking that you are likely or planning to build some more inventory in the coming quarter? And as you've now made some progress in reducing the lead-times, do you get the sense that your lead-times, Kevin, based on what you see now are likely with the plans that you have in place to be at the normalized levels by, say, the end of the third quarter? Or do you think that could happen somewhat earlier?
Kevin March
Tim, on the inventory build-out, if you look at into specific forecast on the inventory itself. I would just point out though, as I mentioned earlier to one of the other questions, at a 1.14 book-to-bill, really our orders are stronger than our outlook, which means we are getting orders that are probably out into the first quarter. And so in the second quarter, we will begin to build not only the second quarter deliveries but also third quarter deliveries. And to the extent that the revenue continues to grow, of course we have to build more inventory to support that. So you would see some growth if in fact we expect revenue to increase in the third quarter. But it’s too early for me to give you a forecast on that.
But as to the lead-times reach a normal level, I think our customers would love if I could say right now, but the truth of the matter is, we do plan on continuing to put equipment in place for each of the quarters of 2010. And it’s really going to be a function of just how strong demand continues to be. If it keeps on coming in at the upper end of our forecast ranges, it will take us longer to get that lead-time cleared up. If it comes in around the midpoint or lower, we’ll clean it up sooner. And clearly it is in our interest to try to get it cleaned up as quickly as possible, and I’d like to say the 2010 numbers.
Tim Luke – Barclays
A follow-up if I may is, given what you've seen, and you had a stronger than expected beginning of the year in the first quarter, then seasonal traditionally and maybe seasonal-ish in the second quarter, do you feel that you're now entering an environment that's likely to play out after the second half of the year largely according to seasonal norms given what you see? Or do you feel, given the strength of the beginning of the year, that you might expect it to be somewhat more moderate than the norm? And obviously Rich, in recent speeches, has been talking about how it's unusual to see a book-to-bill of more than one for five quarters. And this is the fifth quarter. But on the other hand, it seems you're saying that you've seen quite good order strength through the beginning of this. Do you have any further thoughts that you might be able to sort of share or frame with us in terms of expectation on how that book-to-bill might begin to trend? Thank you.
Kevin March
Look, I can give you a short answer and say I probably don’t know the answer to that question. But I would say that what we are seeing here is the results of economies are generally growing again and the consumers are beginning to spend again. We are seeing it in the automotive space. We are seeing the consumer space. We are seeing the industrial coming back. We know that inventories remain very lean, as we’ve been talking about. And it doesn’t appear to us that they are likely to become that cleared up, if you will, in the first half. So that would suggest that we will continue to see some interesting growth as to exactly what size – I don’t know how to forecast that for you right now.
Ron Slaymaker
So, Tim, one thing I would just add is, there has been a whole lot normal about this downturn and the subsequent recovery that we’ve gone through. I mean, I think the last 18 months has been highly unusual. So I wouldn’t try to force it into any kind of normal pattern matching. And then I think the other comment I would make is if you look at our second quarter outlook of – the middle of the outlook really is pretty seasonal for TI in terms of the second quarter. So we don’t have an outlook that we are issuing for second half, but at least the next quarter we can affirm our belief that it should be seasonal, at least in the middle of that range. Okay, Tim, thank you.
And for all of you, thank you for joining us. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.
