### **MVP overview**
* **Goal:** This project seeks to programmatically understand key topics and words of interest in the investor communications of TXN (and potentially other companies) via its publicly available transcripts for earnings calls, investor conferences, and analyst days. Successful topic modeling of these documents could allow an investor or industry analyst to rapidly recognize the most important topics of conversation regarding TXN's financial health and industry outlook. 
* **Process:** This project leverages 10 years of transcripts (in total ~75 documents with over 3mm words) of TXN's public communications, made available via Seeking Alpha's API. Public communications include earnings conference calls, investor days, and bank-sponsored investor conferences, and typically cover topics including the financial health of the company, industry trends, corporate strategy, and technology development. Text pre-processing was extensive to make this document set viable for NLP, with steps including **a)** omitting select proper nouns that were overwhelmingly numerous in each document (eg analyst names); **b)** eliminating low-value 'filler' words in addition to stopwords; and **c)** separating document sets by time period. 
* **Preliminary conclusions:** Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling of the transcript document list I've constructed yields optimistic results. The financial terminology inherent in these transcripts makes use of ngram tokenization valuable to an extent, though results are so far inconclusive of the optimal parameters for tokenization and number of topics. Based on the figures below, one can see that for 3-topic analysis produces word groupings that align to concepts like profitability, growth outlook, end market commentary, and general corporate strategy. For example, topics 0, 1, and 2 for Q&A in years 2014-2015 include high-density of words like (_gross margin_, _cash flow_, _free cash_, and _legacy wireless_ **[financial topic]**); (_end market_, _growth rate_, _global GDP_ **[demand topic]**); and (_embedded processing_, _wireless infrastrcutre_, and _personal electronics_ **[general strategy topic]**) respectively. These groupings generally align to my expecations with modest overlap acorss topics. 
* **From here:** I believe this is a viable project based on these results, contingent on further tuning of the documents/tokens. To develop this further, I will optimize tokenization of the documents, and quantify key word occurence over time. Notably, there is a thematic shift in conversation over the last decade of transcripts from operational strategy to financial decision making by the C-suite (cash flow and free cash seem to occur more frequently in the last 4 years), which is in-line with my company-specific knowledge for TXN.
