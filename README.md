### **Project scope**
* **Background:** It's heuristic knowledge among (successful) stock pickers that there are usually 3 major factors that drive a stock's valuation, such as product releases, outlook for the business cycle, competitive positioning, etc. Identifying these drivers can be time consuming, especially for an unfamiliar company or industry. Using transcribed company/investor commentary, I suspect that NLP can be a useful tool in understanding key topics of interest over time, requiring a fraction of the effort compared to manually reading dozens of documents.   
* **Data & implementation:** This project will leverage 10 years of transcripts (in total ~80 documents with over 3mm words) of TXN's public communications, made available via Seeking Alpha's API. Public communications include earnings conference calls, investor days, and bank-sponsored investor conferences, and typically cover topics including the financial health of the company, industry trends, corporate strategy, and technology development. 
* **Tool/technology requirements:** This analysis will employ topic modeling with LDA as a baseline. Visualizations will be constructed with Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
* **Objective(s):** An MVP for this project will identify a handful of topics and their trends over the lagging 10 year period in order to assess what concepts are at the forefront of the investment community's sentiment.
