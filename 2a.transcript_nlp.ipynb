       "array(['you we’ll go to of of for taking my and when at the last few quarter your reported sale have been significantly above your guided mean between to above your original outlook and that’s making it very hard to distinguish right between how to read your guidance because even now you’re guiding to a flattish outlook and what suppose to be seasonally stronger Should we take to be conservatism Should we take to be a peaking in the cycle how is the demand is so strong You’re increasing supply but yet your sale outlook is flattish it a very confusing message and would love your insight into how to interpret your guidance Are we reading them in the right way for the would perhaps normal seasonal pattern may not be the best measure to at thing in period this Certainly the last few quarter we would all agree have been unusual we’ve gone through and a we continue to move through and a you the last few quarter have been exceptionally strong Second certainly strong both and yearoveryear if you at our guidance it would suggest next again be a very strong in a you our guidance is the best estimate we have at this what we try to do and try to give you insight have a follow on from what you assume you are again implying conservatism unless you suggest otherwise real is when at the share buyback activity it been very low in the last few quarter there are only a few reason why would be right is the simplest reason maybe the stock is perhaps not attractive at these valuation or it could be preparing for some MA or is it some large CapEx or some caution about macro to trying to understand why is there such a material shift in term of your return of cash flow strategy right understand the dividend part been very strong but the share buyback activity been very low over the last almost a now we appreciate your view a to why you are not buying back your stock at the pace at which you have historically done so you happy to address one me take you back to how we about cash return it very well you follow u for many year heard u about this human capital management a in and out our objective when it come to cash returning to return all cash flow to the owner of the do through dividend a well a buyback Now never meant and doesnt mean every single or even every single where return is to be exactly right If you at our history over plus year it been actually above show our commitment to and commitment not changed are committed to returning all cash flow to the owner of the over you well go to the next please the next be of so much for taking the had two a well guess one clarification when you talked about automotive you up in the Did test right Did you not give a number of automotive correct up low single digit Toshi Got it Do you have followon in term of margin realize you run the management for margin clearly you had a very very strong in and you guide margin based on how thinking about utilization rate in your factory given what you about pricing in your both on the analogue side a well a the embedded side are you thinking about margin and of the OpEx leverage in your you so me emphasize a point you made do not focus on margin in how we run the you focus is on cash flow generation fact cash flow per share and how we can grow over the longterm right because we ultimately is what drive value for the owner of the you can do at margin you can do it at a lower margin or you can do at a higher margin depends on a number of factor and then to answer your a we have always guided over the longterm not only one or even many one but over the longterm to fall through is the right way to generally speaking in the right way to at to model the a we go a you put whatever revenue expectation you have there and fall through what about rate and youll be in the ballpark you Toshi consider two question if well move on to our next the next is to be of for taking my now you about running the to margin but to ask a margin anyways you were at you did very strongly with this you you had of royalty unexpected should have been about point of margin a understand it if do the math right then you had something in Austin cost last should have rolled off this would have been another point give or take actually wondering why margin were in fact if take out the royalty they would have been up point only with point of cost should have rolled off with a massive revenue increase whats on with what happened with margin in the current given all of me address one and then have to ask your quite understand part of your but … maybe royalty working margin maybe they weren’t … Exactly That’s the part did it you’re assuming royalty me address about royalty used to be in revenue and margin year three or four year yes we moved to other income and expense is in line other income expense it nothing to do with margin been for three or four year or so since we and the reason we moved is very de minimis it a relatively small amount average about a Of course in the big scheme of thing given our revenue is a relatively small amount and we expect to be continue to be small the other part of your last we had about a hit to our margin because of the winter storm in did about during the call we mentioned and all in margin yes you can adjust can you however you wish for to get the margin without impact right may make more when you at the trend Does answer your that’s very helpful you you have a one right still have a followup or my followup yes guiding revenue flat and guiding EPS down slightly either margin are down or OpEx is up Although mean normally optic seasonably into would be down a few point guess on those are you expecting any sort of different OpEx trend into a you would normally see in the normal is there something else on because normally it down well so the reason EPS is moving at the midpoint is the royalty we talked about right you take out from the EPS we delivered get to a more normalized EPS without royalty and then compare to the next youll see there nothing unusual there obviously we only give revenue and EPS if there something unusual in between the line we would point it out and there nothing unusual Nothings changing much between the other line right yep you well go to the next please next we have of afternoon for me ask the and want to go back to the revenue guidance sort of flat at the midpoint with down guess trying to wrap my head around the fact your deficiency of increased in the you your hotspot went up sound demand is still relatively strong yet there a part of your guidance could be down which having a hard grasping maybe you can about end market Are there any end market particularly theyre cooling off into the calendar why the down sequential have to go back to see quite a bit of to see you have a flat to down sequential when you down to clarify are you saying part of our would imply it could be down and the other part would imply it be up what that’s to clarify part of the you yes if there something unusual on within an end market or region or product area always provided insight into to help understand an outlook or even something happened in a current Ill there nothing unusual we feel we would need to explain whats on a mentioned earlier to Viveks on the topic seasonality isnt the best to be looking at a been moving through the last few quarter would what implies the revenue still be still be strong a follow on a my follow on on with the proposed purchase of Lehi should we about sort of the building on a planned pilot line on a planned but capacity at of slowed or how do we about of now your mix of capacity a Lehi come in next what mean for CapEx and the ramp of me tell you about me step back everyone objective when it come to CapEx is to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth specifically extending our low cost manufacturing advantage primarily millimeter right we’ve talked about for a long and it a core part of our stride of our competitive advantage is having manufacturing and technology advantage be the millimeter factory Lehi be our millimeter factory become operational sometime in the middle of next when the shell be completed and then we be deploying equipment there then were incurring CapEx because of CapEx a at the last call be higher both in absolute dollar and a percent of revenue because of then on top of at Lehi right which we didnt have last when we had talked when we had the earnings call now Lehi is to be on top of a purchase price which run through CapEx but then in addition to factory it ready for production once we qualify it but at relatively low volume still have to add CapEx at factory to take it to the volume we want and happen over of CapEx is to be is to run about half of what CapEx run talking over year right a we deploy equipment there both of those add to the strength or strengthen our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology with two more millimeter factory you we go to the next please be of for taking the want to ask on not to guide but of any feel you can for seasonality been out the window typically a down trying to get a better handle on the back half obviously the flattening market but at much higher level Anything you can throw out there for certainly there lot of speculation on how long the strong demand last and certainly read the range it to end soon and others it is to continue for quite some obviously a you stated we are not to forecast the or even comment on how long the cycle last because honestly a you we anyone know we can frame how the action taken and our approach a gone through the cycle in the phase u accelerate into the widely anticipated decline and enabled u to gain ground in the phase were working to ensure we gain strategic ground particularly in industrial and automotive and those gain reward u for year to independent of we are investing for the longterm some of the obvious thing you can see are the new manufacturing investment in If down here in you see crane up over the building counted six or seven at the max were up over additional Lehi some of the le visible one are the RD investment and new capability at ticom and those investment are continuing we wont we go through cycle wont be able to predict it but we can make the place stronger can continue to invest in our competitive advantage do you have followon wanted to ask you on inventory level way down at these sale level on a day inventory but your ability to grow absolute amount and if able to do in the start and you want to followup inventory level me everyone the objective there maintain high level of customer satisfaction while minimizing obsolescence which frankly is not an issue given our model are clearly below desired level we during the remark right are running about day and our target is to day part of the reason why we have the hotspot we talked about the same tell you we go back to last when the pandemic starting in fact of last everybody all our competitor were decreasing their inventory level slowing down factory went the other way right maintained and in fact increased our production level increased our inventory level They went from about day to some day almost along with our strategy our model helped to put u in a great position to take advantage of the situation and helped u do significantly better than our competitor over the last three or four quarter right we have gotten to a point where yes thing are inventory is now below desired level continue to add incremental capacity a we have talked about is in all of our factory especially but the next bigger tranche of capacity in with a we talked about earlier Once is operational sometime in the or next then that’s when we finish and when we produce revenue sometime in the half of next then add a significant amount of capacity and then shortly after Lehi also in line for additional revenue capacity there maybe quickly what might add to obviously whenever thing do slow we then use of to rebuild inventory in those position to be able to support growth in the future so add one more Both and Lehi those are longterm play right These are this is to strengthen our manufacturing advantage owning our own manufacturing which clearly proven over the last and a half we knew already but it proven how important is in the current environment They are to happen to help in the medium most likely but if they if thing slow down and it doesnt work out way is completely fine with u not why we are equipping those factor not why we bought were buying Lehi is for the longterm positioning of the to support longterm revenue growth in both and Embedded you go to the next please next we go to of you very much and had a on cash flow per share you at it on a quarterly if at the last year if at cash flow per share down it flat if at this on a it is up doubledigit but it lagged sorry for the background noise it always happens when on a call If at the month and then so in line with what you have consistently should we expect this to back to the doubledigit on an annualized Whats the right way to about the lag over the last year and how should we about it this is one most financial metric are this way too but if you want to at this over the longterm right any one or even any one they could be a choppy mentioned a of year when and even where trajectory not represent the longer arguably the same for or the month number you quoted right if you want to at this over the longterm and how we at it and whats to ultimately drive value for the owner of the right That’s fair Do you have a follow on did all the tightness and contrast this with the way you have managed the and the share shift show up quickly because these design are such long lasting and they change on a dime Are you seeing any discernible change in your design in activity a a result of what from your peer with the tightness and you managing your lead time and inventory much better than some of your peer you start off and if you want to add would a you we have started on the journey to have closer direct relationship with customer year with our investment on ticom investment in our sale application team investment in process and how we do and our structure of the last you saw a major step of taking more customer direct and operating with fewer distributor a well a transacting through ticom you of mix together with the pandemic c and our ability to do virtual sale call all those thing have positioned u well strategically especially in market industrial automotive those market where we want to gain strategic ground with availability and you thing move quickly but the supply shortage started showing up in the beginning of took a break in the or when the pandemic hit and then reaccelerated after there are case are unusual but there are case where customer redesign board because of availability describe a an outlier we do see case of but we see more case where you have design are being intersected a they through again our sale team are engaged from production all the way back into engineering and give visibility is a great strategic advantage and those benefit again be thing pay reward for u for a long to you for one last be of by the way for the other analyst go and beat you up on the flat guidance have to is on the auto revenue if we at the headline and to the folk in the auto supply chain there still a lot of shortage etcetera etcetera out there your revenue only slightly up can you explain the discrepancy seems it would be up a bit more than if there all these folk clamoring for part out there would point out it over doubled from a yearago it a bit more than up a bit and pointing to the sequential again last it up over from prepandemic level we are shipping more car from prepandemic level right our shipment into automotive are up and up significantly and we continue to add capacity and continue to we believe we are gaining share there a well to measure it over yes so we are our shipment are up there and up strong you have a followon guess the hotspot you seeing a few more hotspot last Do you the situation get a bit worse this or do you it get better do you youll start to get a handle on all these sort of supply issue out there guess it to depend on demand right are on the supply side a we we are adding capacity incrementally have been and we continue to do bigger tranche of capacity doesnt in until about a from now right a we talked about and then month later Lehi it be a while before we’ve big tranche of capacity coming online it to depend on demand the end of the day we fully control there is more of a macro situation but we are better than our peer and have been in both the tactical decision we have made during the pandemic but more importantly our model and how we run the specifically own in our own manufacturing there been a key in this whole process and we are doubling down on We’ve what we were doing with all those factory we talked about you do you want up go ahead and wrap up me emphasize what we have previously our core we are engineer and technology is the foundation of our ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate longterm value for owner is the growth of cash flow per share While we strive to achieve our objective we continue to pursue our three ambition act owner who own the for decade adapt and succeed in a world ever changing and we be a we are personally proud to be a part of and would want a our neighbor where successful our employee customer community and owner all benefit you and have a good concludes today’s call you for your may now',\n",
       "       'you well go to with clearly very strong well above seasonality and above guidance however your sequential guidance is flat is well below seasonality my is are you seeing cancellation and push out or why such weak guidance after a strong for aren’t seeing cancellation or push out if you into to your observation very strong both and yearonyear at the midpoint be a strong from a yearonyear standpoint you have a follow up mean guess would be a follow on to the this would be the lowest sequential guidance you have given in some guess why not not guide for a seasonal or even close seasonal sequential guide it it is the best estimate we have for our revenue for the again would describe it a following a very strong it be a strong again you go to the next next well go to with for taking my want to about your inventory strategy you have a strategy to build out inventory for customer service guess how do reconcile with the fact your inventory dollar are down and still getting some pocket of lead of extended weakens Is a function of demand of the pole is so strong you cant keep up guess in light how do you parse the quality of those order getting do you Are you having to shipping whatever is being asked for at this point guess what are the plan for loading and inventory a we go into to try to replenish the inventory been drained Now so for your me step back and everyone inventory our objective there is to maintain high level of customer service minimize while we minimize obsolescence and improve manufacturing realization a you alluded in the we would prefer to have higher level of inventory fact what day a day capital management strategy we increased the target for inventory to to day up from Prior to so yes wed to have more inventory in the current environment were focusing our capacity on fulfilling demand not on building inventory whenever thing slowdown which at some point or and or a we increase capacity which we are increasing capacity incrementally we have them continue to their to the balance of this into the half of next then in the half of next we have a output from our RFAB II a those thing together then we be able to build more inventory you had a other part of why you use your follow up for if missed something Ill use the follow up how are you parsing the quality of the order getting Are you skipping whatever is being ordered at this point and glad you glad you chose one a a follow up Ill highlight a you we have moved away from distributor over the last year it been more of a process in the last few year more we pulled the trigger and actually no longer ship into too many distributor we used to now were direct with with a lot of our customer To the point where we exited last with almost two third of our revenue shipping direct put u in a great position particularly in the current environment we have we now have more direct access to those customer who have a better understanding of what they need have we have intermediary in between frankly clouding thing up frankly a the way it happened a lot with the distributor so then we use information to better allocate our resource both inventory manufacturing etcetera in order to fulfill demand from our customer great you Now we’ll go to the next please our next from with good afternoon somebody asked the not original but a follow up to the revenue guide you did you would be growing supply from to the implication is you might be able to build some inventory in your own balance sheet given how lean inventory are across the channel would you wouldnt expect incremental supply you bring on not to be used by your customer and actually show sequential revenue growth getting a new one in and picking some of the thing would you we drain inventory to right even if were increasing output doesnt necessarily mean well be able to build inventory What earlier you shouldnt take a a statement were to build inventory into would add were to add incremental inventory or incremental capacity through the balance of this and through the half of this next until RFAB II come on which would be in the half of multiple piece are moving there have a follow on it nice to see in the embedded at least growing faster than talked about this in the about of the growth there is of lag of do you feel within the embedded market turning the corner on it you help u of understand how you see the design funnel there what the growth rate in market might be beyond of the cyclical recovery Ill give you a few comment on you want to follow up high were pleased with the trajectory of embedded still however were still in very early phase right we have before our goal with embedded to stabilize embedded make some change we have made and then leverage our competitive advantage we have to have embedded headed in a better direction were in the early phase but were pleased with those early result you you well go to the next please Moving on well go to with for the color on lead time guess in the hotspot maybe or so been impacted you give a of what seeing there maybe your of when you would expect the lead time in certain area to normalize Theres a lot of moving piece on to correct it premature to try to pick team are obviously working very hard with customer to close those demand and fulfill those need it based on technology and package and what those customer requirement are have a follow on then personal electronics up Yearoveryear there been some nice tailwind from work from home more color in term of some of the segment seeing growth how you feel about for at a high what well give color by end market if there something unusual on we out into a can there nothing unusual we feel the need to call out we back into and in the few quarter in personal electronics the demand there been very broad based both by customer across the board a well a by and a a reminder in spite of personal electronics well have thing handset and tablet and personal computer including laptop television smart speaker those type of thing it a broad category printer it broad category there is nine ten different sector make up personal electronics and very strong demand across across all of those is want to go back to the lead time Earlier several people asked about inventory the end of the day thing are to be tied a long a demand is ahead of supply thing are to be tied lead time are to be tied the key point here is we own our own manufacturing and technology right is a key differentiator versus our competitor is one of our competitive advantage we are in a strategically in a unique strategic position to be able to have control inventory be able to add to capacity incrementally for the next and a half or so then more significantly after when RFAB II is built and it start to get equipped a big difference versus our competitor put u in a much better position to fulfill customer demand both short and more importantly over the long haul a we continue to focus on industrial automotive all those customer are in those great space color you go to the next you from with afternoon for answering my the extended lead time maybe a different way to ask the also asked about of your wafer requirement most of it is embedded and you outsource of your test and assembly wondering if this is where seeing maybe more of the extended lead time given the capacity a tight a your outsourced partner is it across both internal and outsourced manufacturer not specifically there is more based on technology or end market driven or package type described it a hotspot it of a combination of those thing when demand is outstripping the short supply back to Rafaels point fact we do the majority of assembly test inhouse most of our peer do Most of our peer have assembly outside even is a very large number we control and do inhouse Also because we do of our wafer inhouse we can expand capacity incrementally Also we control the cost to a much higher degree than our peer a well those are very important thing in time these it’s a tremendous advantage top of the fact millimeter were adding capacity it coming in at structurally lower cost in addition to it you have a follow on for the insight there good again to see the yearoveryear momentum in the embedded somebody tried to ask a about this previously but wondering if you could you refocus some of the sub segment within embedded last wondering if you could give u a profile of embedded relative to the overall corporate profile mean it have the same end market exposure a the overall is it more skewed now towards one or particular end market on a go what end market within embedded are you spending more RD dollar what the investment we have in embedded we have directed at the best growth opportunity a we took a step back we wanted to focus them into direction They are bias towards industrial and the automotive market largest portion of our revenue are pointed in those two market a well do have a bit of revenue in communication enterprise and PE ph of but the majority of the revenue is in those two market again a were in the early stage objective to get the revenue stabilized we feel very good about the progress made so far were making the investment there because we believe embedded be a great contributor to cash flow growth over the long we believe several year from now well back and well be very pleased with the investment made be very pleased with the cash flow growth embedded have contributed to the you go to the next please you from with of you very much a on the order pattern seeing Many of your peer have talked about no cancellation policy facet of the we havent in and you could never are you customer are looking for commitment to capacity and then a a result having to change your clause with the customer in term of cancellation policy or what have you Are there any change on front we a good idea to go down path to force customer to tell u what they need a from now you can demand they tell you what they need in or of can assure you they what they need a from now want to be in a position where we can supply them what they need and be a supplier they can count on a well competitive advantage of manufacturing technology and owning controlling our manufacturing asset also give u control of our cost there we havent been in a position where had to go in and raise price a many of our other peer have and we believe those two thing combined are translating into share gain right when you at the revenue in this we believe part of is share gain Ill quickly also point out to measure over at or measure it over one we do believe be something benefit u for a very long to have follow on do quickly on the capacity and CapEx intensity we shouldnt be modeling a different intensity over the next few quarter correct should be within the guidance given a you build the Fab then is half a pull in versus what you were expecting it not a pull in about where always expected now me answer the part of your you a you very well been following u for a while talked about our guide for CapEx a percent of revenue at about did at the capital management strategy meeting is a valid number over the long it a model to help you about our CapEx the reality is in the short for two three year were to run higher than in absolute term and also the percent of revenue a we continue to invest both short to get ahead of the current situation but more importantly longer a we continue to strengthen our competitive advantage of having our own manufacturing technology particularly millimeter a we talked about provides such a great structural cost advantage in controlling our own manufacturing supply theyve been is early during this pandemic and cycle proven worthwhile you well go to the next please you from with a lot also wanted to ask about the guidance there some school of thought because you control your supply chain and your model and inventory would sort of drive some share gain and some more upside given whats on typically conservative and you have a very tough comp on wonder if maybe customer are not pulling your product because of shortage elsewhere it is sitting there in consignment anyway waiting for them guess the is are you hearing from any of your customer theyre not pulling due to shortage elsewhere maybe contributing somewhat to your guidance we go on at any point Though we believe on at any significant yes we believe a significant factor on in have follow on do guess last the same asked last about the share repo you always cash flow only matter if it returned you didnt buy back much again this over the nine month it sort of seems maybe a bit of a pattern now it three quarter in a row and you have a strong in trinsic value model for your stock can you about stepping back a you alluded to our goal our objective is to return all cash flow to the owner of the over the long if you at our history on front we have been returning all cash flow and then some to the owner of the were to continue doing over Now over over the long mean doesnt necessarily mean every certainly not every maybe not even every right over the long were to return all cash flow to the owner of the do through both dividend and buyback there are different criterion we at for each of those and talked about for one more you from with you and congratulation on the record revenue and earnings or could you step back looking at the last day what is it exactly changed this last Did order continue to accelerate Does the capacity situation ease walk through exactly what changed Ill give you a few comment Not if have perhaps what looking for demand continues to be strong still in a environment where demand exceeds supply capacity Now of course our revenue continued growing in environment and both yearonyear clearly but also right we are incrementally adding capacity while we do also in the while we have done we have over this entire cycle we have focused on making the stronger right we have back if you at the phase of this pandemic back in or when everybody pulling back we built through cycle a tactical decision enabled by our strategic position of our focus on industrial automotive on catalog part with low risk obsolescence so were able to build through cycle be for the other side once demand started returning quickly a it turned out also a we did we also gain a strategic ground focusing on auto and industrial how we have grown in those phase while we have done we have invested for the long invested in competitive advantage the most obvious one is manufacturing technology already talked about here there also our product portfolio right continue to strengthen the RD in the best then the other one is to have channel which we havent talked about much we continue to strengthen and may be the most obvious one is the other comp and everything were doing there to support our customer with very very high availability in fact immediate availability in a lot of case with many part inventory there for customer to buy direct from u on the other comp have a follow on you your operating margin very shy of a record in the talked about OpEx of being between and of revenue Now it obvious there so much demand out there and it sustainable Is it safe to OpEx ratio is to change and maybe stay at to what tell you on is in the short we run OpEx on a at about not to change much in the short right it doesnt need to Right feel very good about those investment we feel very good about where theyre Theyre long in nature in RD but also part of SGA is is the telecom example we of a an investment of course even those it’s in SGA we see number in the short changing much but over the long over many year the guidance we have given you of to still apply so you should still of it in those term so the last one me go ahead and wrap up by reiterating what we have previously our core were engineer and technology is the foundation of our ultimately our objective and best metric to measure progress and generate long value for owner is the growth of cash flow per share While we strive to achieve our objective we continue to pursue our three ambition we act owner who own the for decade we adapt and succeed in a world ever changing we be a were personally proud to be a part of and would want u our neighbour were successful employee customer community and owner all benefit you and have a good you today Wed to everyone for their may now',\n",
       "       'to read a disclosure for investor research disclosure can be found at wwwMorganStanleycomResearchDisclosures with if we can kick off starting with the supply chain tightness and how that’s impacting your of but more importantly from a strategic how it play into of TI’s manufacturing strategy and what your strength are me start with start on the strategic angle you gave you we have competitive advantage one is owning our own manufacturing and technology particularly millimeter wafer fabs the value of strategy proving once again in this environment by owning those factory controlling them put u in a good position to do very well in this pandemic other angle would give you is our approach our model of focusing on catalog part in the and embedded space and from an end market in industrial automotive with very long product life cycle strategy enabled u to build inventory last year if not decade then we don’t worry about obsolescence of inventory very much There’s very risk of that’s why we generally have inventory level are higher than our competitor we that’s a good investment again the pandemic and what we went through and still through proven the more tactical lead time remain generally stable and short but there are pocket of tightness there’s no about Automotive is maybe the area would highlight everybody read about in the paper and some of what’s on there we’re after month of strong demand at some point it get to a point where becomes a tight generally speaking we are withstanding and doing much better than competitor on front Got it then you mentioned automotive which it feel most pronounced in term of the snapback we’ve in market other market feel on the tight side a you see it Probably the only one would highlight yeah how about in term of customer engagement and maybe even longerterm agreement for visibility Are you seeing any behavior in term of how customer are responding to how tight thing are it’s a more recent phenomenon but what is it doing in term of some of the customer engagement you have in running the what would tell you is our focus a earlier is on catalog part again catalog defined a part are sold to customer sometimes sometimes even different customer we can and primarily in the industrial automotive market but not only in those market of course we sell into personal electronics and communication and others put u in a position where we can build inventory have a very good availability very very short leadtime then we’re not in a position then to be for our customer to be worried about supply to having to order ahead of or to place longterm agreement or any of sort of anything moving the opposite way on having more and more availability to comment on capital management about a we talked about how we are so confident on strategy and feel so good about it increasing our target for inventory day to to That’s a guideline That’s not a hard number but it give you the confidence we have in the strategy because it’s such a good asymmetric bet to have inventory invested a capital invested inventory so when customer a need it they they can count on u to provide the short leadtimes part Got it can we touch on manufacturing mean there’s a lot in the press recently about policy and thing a they of to address some of these which arguably are a much longerterm issue in term of being able to respond to it and maybe enact some change a one of the larger semi manufacturer are there any type of benefit can see through some potential change in policy so our position when it come to policy is it’s threefold low tax trade and then skilled talent when it come to tax for example or year when tax reform passed finally put the United States in a more playing field compared to what other country around the world do for technology company specifically semiconductor encouragement would be to maintain or improve playing field there are various thing through to Congress and the people are talking about in regard There’s also a lot of about increasing the tax rate right we’ll see what the net effect of all be at the end of the day it’d be important for the United States to have playing field for semiconductor company Got it then any update on the millimeter view in term of timeline of the next fab of where thing stand then from a longerterm perspective what mean in term of incremental revenue you can grow into longerterm so no change tell you what we talked about at the last Capital Meeting which is we’re building the millimeter factory to be here in in Richardson should be ready to have output potential in the half of next Once it’s built and then once it’s fully equipped which happen over factory have the potential of of annual revenue so increment our existing footprint particularly in millimeter a we have talked about give u a tremendous advantage not owning our own manufacturing but having the best cost structure in the industry Got it a you referenced the recent Capital update there are a of small tweak you made increased the dividend payout a a percent of cash flow also raised the inventory of band of target you at you about both of those thing it feed into there a over the around buyback again if it’s a subtle of shift a bit more towards dividend how are you thinking about the cash return aspect of it yeah happy to on inventory much addressed already but to reiterate we’re confident on our inventory strategy it all start with a model and our competitive advantage is how work enables u to then have carry higher level of inventory and feel good about the tradeoff there between tying up some cash on the balance sheet for inventory the potential benefit with to have good availability short leadtimes for our customer the dividend and me step back our commitment been and continues to be to return all cash flow to the owner of the If you at our history for plusyears that’s what we have done we have done through dividend and buyback If you back year dividend a relatively smaller portion of versus buyback Over the last year even out more with buyback about and it varies obviously buyback are more discretionary at the last Capital update we tweaked the dividend metric to of cash flow took to to That’s to convey we would be confident in the sustainability affordability and growth of dividend anywhere in whether it’s or anywhere in would be comfortable with Got it also a part of the Capital update you talked about of RD Certainly auto and industrial been focused market but you’re also investing in other market personal electronics so yeah how the go about prioritizing where to spend what market make the most start on and if you want to add it I’d when we across the market we find good opportunity in all of the market so those a good opportunity is a product we’ve a of differentiation of product can sell to multiple customer across multiple and equipment ideally across multiple sector and market when you find opportunity they tend to live a long those are the type of opportunity we’re looking towards you find more of those type of opportunity in the industrial and automotive market continue to be a priority for u we’ll continue to follow in find good opportunity in our market Got it me to follow can you about scale because sometimes that’s something come up in discussion around how much you spend on an absolute versus a percent of sale how important is scale you have in term of leveraging the investment you’re making you having these product to multiple different market bring it to one of our competitive advantage which is the breadth of our portfolio if you at the breadth of our portfolio it isn’t so much scale but it’s we’ve product in a lot of the subsegments of a well in embedded give u the opportunity to participate in more project at customer more socket per project and sell more content in each of those project to the ability for each of our investment it allows u to find more home for each of those investment that’s what scale if you scale by itself isn’t the advantage necessary but not sufficient a good way to describe it maybe we can shift gear towards the distribution strategy you’ve been taking the more direct in recent year that’s mostly run it course if you can reiterate of what are some of the key highlight of this in advantage for protects and versus perhaps some of the competitor who is still relying more heavily on distribution if you at the shift we had this described it a substantial we’ve been working towards for year it in general been thrilled with the increase direct relationship with our customer and the early result we’re seeing there we started the with about onethird of our revenue coming direct to we left the with twothirds of the revenue coming direct number may continue to increase a bit but not substantially higher again we’re already seeing the benefit of it and we’ll get benefit of higher growth through more access to the customer project the socket per project and insight into what our customer are doing we believe be an advantage be difficult for many of our competitor to replicate So… Got it if you about a the strategy unfolded are there any difference by geography in term of maybe with direct you take all and it make versus if distribution still a role and it’s still a of your ph some of is fulfillment how do you about geography and influence in part where you still are using distribution Does play an important role wouldn’t it’s based on geography the operating side of the house for our customer have many need but a of those need is availability and pricing or cost of our product and my having a direct relationship certainly have the best availability because we own and control the inventory of our product and direct with u we have the best pricing there may be a need for customer to have service from a distributor and that’s there’s no problem with customer find great value in it regardless of what region they’re in should they find value though negotiate and discus with the distributor what value is and what service they’ll provide we’ll see continue into the future because of the service they provide Got it you about industry consolidation across semi and specifically in and microcontrollers a we’ve this consolidation are there anything you’re seeing of change at the margin in term of competitive dynamic what would tell you if you step back over the last year we’ve had a few period in our history where we acquisition have made for u where we have found opportunity to strengthen our competitive advantage we mentioned earlier scale is a component of but it’s not sufficient not the only but it did help u broaden the portfolio get some scale on the manufacturing front the last one in with the National acquisition since then our focus been and continue to be organic growth is to then continue to strengthen and then leverage those competitive advantage in our much better efficient effective strategy and again given where we are not to mention the valuation in the industry have been such data even if we wanted to it’d be difficult to justify some of those acquisition Understood then for the industry what’s your guy’s in term of longer growth why that’s relative to GDP or of a mix of your yeah how do you about on a longer the growth potential in the a we have talked about it in previous year don’t our view changed much on is a sub point or a an industry hired and then GDP because semiconductor content continues to grow we are on top of we’re gaining share we have gained share consistently we’re in the best market industrial automotive where the content growth is growing even faster than in other place we ended up we can of our target a being a few point ahead of GDP Got it maybe switching gear to the embedded market there’s been some more change for there in recent year and company talked about where it want to prioritize investment and shifted some investment but maybe about the decision process behind in term of how you’re trying to optimize and where you play would if you at overall our objective with to get the stabilized would we’re pleased with the progress we’ve there we’re investing in we what we need to do at this point is to prove we can grow sustainably over the longterm take some to prove out we want to have product reach a broad set of customer play to our competitive advantage we’re focused and working very hard to do again we’re making those investment because we believe contribute to cash flow growth over the long Got it in the remains in term of you’re optimizing around Is it similar in term of growth prospect relative to GDP Are there any put and take of how you about embedded versus longerterm we both the and embedded business are big enough piece of the semiconductor market they’ll both grow about the same rate from a market standpoint if we’re executing well we continue to gain share and both of those market so they both have the same growth potential Got it wanted to dig into some of the end market and growth in the certainly a substantial change of mix over the year towards auto and industrial both of these market are broad based in term of the application you play one area that’s gotten increased attention in the last is the inflection in EVs and we’d love to about of what mean for of where you you’re positioned and of the certain of technology there are best suited for you to capitalize on our strategy in automotive been very intentionally to have a broad based footprint we could measure and a of different direction one is by looking at the sector so electric vehicle would sit in a we call power train system would also pick up hybrid but we’ve other sector we’re investing which include infotainment and cluster display ADAS system safety system and then body electronics and lighting we often joke about getting design win and taillight there’s lot of semiconductor content and turn signal and taillight and nobody writes article about it it’s not very exciting we’d of content if you at our product portfolio we’ve different product line the of those product line ship product into the automotive industry then if you at a customer standpoint we’ve close to different automotive OEMs of course the revenue be weighted towards the Tier if you take any Tier we’ll have a of different product ship to any Tier so again trying to build on breadth of product and the competitive advantage which is diversity and long lived position automotive is a great example of competitive advantage Got it similar to how we talked about overall more broadly of growth pointed to about GDP is there a way you of about automotive relative to production in term of what some of the growth prospect there both automotive and industrial are both the market where you’ve content that’s being expanding right if you backwards a a frame of reference over the last or even year you’ve had auto are growing somewhere between and where the semiconductor market or TAM in market grown somewhere in the uppersingledigits people pick different number of That’s an easier number to get to and to identify because any semiconductor know when you’re shipping into automotive because there are certain standard and thing you need to do with product we can count the number of car are being shipped per Industrial the same type of content expansion that’s on in market we’ve different sector and hundred if not thousand of endequipments we’re shipping to you can’t quite dimensionalize it so easily the same type of opportunity but a lot more diversified and hence why we the opportunity there Got it then maybe following up on industrial and appreciate of the bucket in auto you of to drive growth and now there’s even more of within the industrial but any of those you would highlight within industrial from an application perspective produce strong growth it’s the beauty of industrial and often get teased bore people when about all of the different sector we’re investing in a we define industrial every semiconductor may define it slightly different unlike automotive where it’s clean cut our definition include thing the financial community would obviously identify a industrial factory automation or building automation grid infrastructure industrial transport but also include medical aerospace appliance those type of thing because they have the same market dynamic and behavior a those others and you can drill down into any one of those sector and take medical a an example or literally hundred maybe even thousand of different end equipment of medical could of a medical imaging system may sell for million of dollar down to a blood glucose meter a an example may sell for le than and everything in between great opportunity and customer in any of those sector are trying to make their product more efficient lighter more precise more capable more connected any of those vector you need semiconductor to be able to do Got it then how long on the personal electronics mean auto and industrial certainly have people have identified with those growth driver on a multiyear Personal electronics’ last month been very strong and there is some influence of the pandemic on what’s happened how do you about of last month versus a you on a longerterm some of the thing some of the key driver in personal electronics certainly when you at personal electronics you can even see some of those content driver happening maybe not to the same degree personally in the last we upgraded our TV and some speaker of the house those TVs had WiFi and connectivity of them speaker were connected and smart speaker we had in the house year those would have been a paper diaphragm with a magnet attached to them even of personal electronics there’s more content being shipped per system benefit a portfolio we have again the strength we saw a we exited the very very broadbased across the portfolio reflective of some of those trend Got it right we’re coming up on the minute appreciate spend the with you both and everyone else for joining a well you you Have a good day right Take care',\n",
       "       'you go to with good afternoon for me ask the question on the solid result wondering if you could a bit about the current demand backdrop mean clearly we are hearing about lead stretching out in the semi industry many of your peer are talking about raising pricing guess specifically to you can you help u understand what your lead time are doing What you are thinking about doing around pricing guess more importantly given your inventory strategy and the fact you ran your fabs a bit fuller last do you the current result represent your ability to gain some incremental share a some of your peer are having a harder supplying customer right now me take you covered a lot of ground with me take some piece of it if you want to add anything and if miss anything well give you a chance for the followup the one is certainly read the same report and seeing the same release from our peer on the supply constraint in raising price short answer we doing the short answer is no brings u to one of our foundational competitive advantage is manufacturing and technology and provides two benefit is the obvious which is lower cost but the is greater control of our supply chain it time this and throughout greater control of your supply chain becomes a great advantage add on the inventory angle of your Remember our longterm objective for inventory a we have talked about in many capital management call is to maintain high level of customer service while we minimize inventory obsolescence Now part of the reason we can do is we are strategically positioned the way we run the our model and competitive advantage where we our part are mainly catalog part sell into industrial and automotive focus is on those with very long product life cycle so we can build inventory ahead of demand we can position inventory well served u well in and continue to serve u well from a model standpoint in order to maintain those high level of customer service with our customer we most of the piece you have a followup or other piece we can touch on a quick followup you specifically guide margin but wondering if you give u some parameter around OpEx for the next of quarter mean were heading into strong cyclical recovery in revenue off of what of an unusual expense last with COVID so a we about the can you help u of frame the cost around SGA and RD we should be thinking about if you want to give u a margin target would be great you tend to avoid on a margin we have before of to fall through you figure out what revenue incremental revenue you want to play in and follow through at to and youll get a good place over the longterm right any one can be a higher to the lower right OpEx we talked about we can operate between and the last three or four year we have been between and much right mean to narrow phrase but where been running and would expect to stay somewhere in neighborhood Between and between and Right you well go to the next please from with of you for taking my on the strong growth wanted to followup on the demand even if you are able to supply because of your very strong strategic capacity do you your customer especially on the automotive side might be constrained with other part of the bill of material they get from others and maybe those become bottleneck trying to reconcile the very strong demand backdrop we are hearing from your result and your outlook versus all the news around auto supply chain facing more constraint What is the true of of supply and demand across your customer base would be very helpful to hear your view a great see the same report you are seeing the best way to maybe describe what were seeing in the automotive market is a in supply chain restarting from essentially a full stop happened in a a reminder what we saw in a sequential increase followed by this last with a sequential increase what Ill is is those report are fairly widespread but we arent seeing demand signal would show u there is anything consistent with any of those constraint you are pointing out or are in press release Do you have a follow on you to see the growth in the Embedded and you made some change in last Do you we start to see the benefit of in because they also tend to be somewhat stickier market so if you could give u an update on what are you doing specifically to regain market share do you we can start to see your Embedded start to grow in line with your this you Ill give you a feel on those one were pleased with the progress were seeing in Embedded plan called to stabilize the and then start to prove we can resume our longterm consistent growth leveraging our competitive advantage particularly building a broadbased a more diverse product portfolio can then deliver longterm sustainable growth it in of where we announced where we had a restructuring charge related to Embedded and we reallocated resource from some product line increased investment some we decreased other side about the same and were seeing the beginning of stabilization on front you for Now well go to the next please hear next from with you following up on your comment around auto and particularly the justintime inventory angle certainly a challenging for the supply chain and were dealing with some of those repercussion now do you youll see some change to over in term of how they operate from an inventory perspective or something it might be difficult for the next of quarter but of get back to justintime want to speak for our customer or how theyre managing their inventory a u and how managed our and our operation We’ve worked very hard to try to have capacity in place to support our customer need saw the decision we made earlier in the to try to keep high service and optionality in place well continue to try to support our customer need whatever their supply chain so and whether in the automotive market or the other market we try to make them happy what were trying to do Do you have followon do then looking at up yearoveryear come off of a difficult and coming out of a down cycle so some of it but at a highlevel to get your thought of the type of strength seeing and how you feel about what the demand is out there you clarify a bit for me so make answer the right with the up yearoveryear coming off of an easy comp if you coming out of the down cycle so some of it in some of these call you talked about your view of our supply and demand equilibrium or how you feel demand is relative to how your business is trending right now when you at where is through a from a cyclical indicator and those type of thing Youd even have to go back to when the industry had reached the cyclical peak then you throwin sprinkle on top COVID and it at the beginning of or at the end of last the beginning of we had begun to seeing sign of stabilization before COVID had hit inventory werent a problem at point in we had at point in our shipment were beginning to reflect what customer were beginning to ship overall again what we are shipping is reflective of what customer are asking u to ship have a good availability of product because of the decision made our leadtimes have stable doesnt mean of course we have hotspot were working we always have hotspot but of where we are you well go to the next please hear next from with afternoon on the strong Amidst the strong demand environment a we all foundry capacity is tight both leading edge and lagging edge outsources about of it wafer requirement most of it with your embedded product MPUs MCUs because of the foundry tightness is the team also somewhat constrained on your Embedded product either or here in and also the same from an assembly and test perspective or about of your assembly and test requirement are outsourced to the subcost Is this constraining maybe some of your shipment near a highlevel we have longterm agreement with these supplier we do with other supplier Even though we only outsource relatively small part of our loading still being a big that’s still a good amount of loading raise we still get some decent leverage were seeing some hotspot here and there but to the largest degree were getting what we need would having of our wafer sourced internally almost all of our analog sourced internally and is a great advantage for u overall a talked about the lead time lead time have stable been a huge advantage for u Do you have a followon absolutely for the insight there you provide u with the shipment trend quarteroverquarter yearoveryear by geography it shipped to location but it still useful to of understand the breadth of the overall demand profile you are seeing in the and you for the preamble there so wont repeat it Asia up and all of the other region were either flat or down and all the region except for the were up a another point of color on where we ship our product of our revenue from shipment outside of the and about of our revenue are based by customer in China a bit more color on the comment you made there earlier you well go to the next please hear now from with a lot guess asked this last too but you again bought back next to no stock and totally get you were running a of a plan in the half and you were certainly a head of the for the fullyear but you also have a strong intrinsic value model for the share repo and you were good at buying back the stock guess maybe Ill ask you again to sort of comment on Is there anything we can read into given it the in a row what would tell you is a we about doing capital management our goal is to return all cash flow to the owner of the generated in of cash flow and we generated of cash flow so clearly well above the cash flow generation following then guess yes yes yes do guess can you give u an update on the millimeter the new FAB and sort of the timing around and guess on can you qualify for some of these subsidy coming from the government or is mostly to be leading edge Things the update on the factory is the same nothing changed a far a our expectation new factory is being built expected to be completed in so next fact we should have some form some of output in the half of next all in a per plane it fully equipped it the potential for revenue of about per your on the incentive a lot of remains to be there are two legislation one one approved but not funded another one hasnt been approved chip is the one hasnt been approved but the one approved not even funded so and there a lot of uncertainty on depending on how come out when come out well at it and well decide if it make for u the biggest or the highest we semiconductor is a foundational technology and anything the government can do to strengthen and to keep u at a playing field company in the United States versus other country would be a good you for one more please from with you and congratulation on the result for typically wouldnt ask you this because you get a lot of these but the royalty this material you maybe add any color on and should we expect sizeable thing a well it about it more most of and we recognize it based on accounting rule cash actually come in not quite come in over but it it a licensing agreement had those for many year They have become the minimum in the at the highest frankly expect to change from a cash standpoint is about a from the revenue or the income recognition standpoint sometimes they in a pop a what you saw but theyve passed which is what matter is more stable than again it about a and expect to change much followon you your longterm goal is to grow CapEx at well to spend of your revenue and CapEx last you it there sort of any COVID related issue slowed thing down a we at do you it in close to sort of Ill go ahead and take yes our guidance is guidance continues to be CapEx presented revenue a longterm guidance includes everything go into CapEx a far a building and equipment Now of course number can fluctuate right Like you pointed out it it fluctuated down in to wouldnt be surprised if it is a higher than for a or two but for your model would suggest you stick with out into the future it simpler way and it get the point across you so much you concludes the call me finish with a few comment and key item we believe deeply we run the with the mindset of being a longterm believe growth of cash flow per share is the primary driver of longterm value ambition and value are integral to how we built stronger were successful in achieving these ambition our employee customer community and shareholder all win you all for joining u of this call be shortly on our again today you all for joining u',\n",
       "       'told you this before these fireside chat with you are terrifying to me one because it you and two because of the consistency of your it difficult to up with new and original question havent already been asked always to start off these fireside chat by giving you the opportunity to of set the table of review for u again of the core strategy of the what do you the key investment proposition is value proposition is for your owner are listening in right now we do take great pride in trying to keep thing boring because there great benefit and return if you can be consistent on front in many way the assumption or where been driving the rotates around a of thing is we at where the world want to go in term of more electronics making product better lower power easier to use more efficient and the various thing in order to do to put electronics and therefore semiconductor of them we at embedded and semiconductor a the best product to be in across the market the added opinion been consistent with this the automotive and the industrial market while we love all our market and theyre all great business for u Theyre to have average up growth over the next year then finally it rotates around this belief cash flow per share is the best proxy to drive value over the long a a result we try to be very disciplined about the competitive advantage of the model we have helping to drive cash flow per share we try to stay very focused when we invest money in those area either strengthen them or to leverage them accordingly if sound vaguely familiar to what heard from u for the year then a good consistency is good one of the thing Ive always admired about you and your organization is the fact you at number very datadriven at historical trend and you of call thing a you see them try to shape color shape with one direction or the other be of given you are sort of a student of the industry do you about where we are in the cycle not something you focus too heavily on to run the be about of your perspective of where the semiconductor is both cyclically but perhaps more importantly structurally guess a of thing and you can follow up on some of the structural question and been on this thesis a the world moved into COVID back in you can or to the frame depending on where you are in the world you somewhat implied with your we took a close at the last big economic disruption and we the wise choice to navigate to stay aggressive with the operating plan because to be in a position to produce thing even though customer wont be able to forecast very well choice ended up helping u had the added theory and believe it is a very fair one a lot of people underestimated already a down compared to and a a result there wasnt much flex for the semiconductor industry to absorb in it much play out way over Now to the of longer there some interesting insight you can potentially arrive at and you have an opinion on these seeing for example the impact of when you have control of your manufacturing internally and a robust continuity plan you can do a better job for your customer we is to be a growing advantage over not the next but the next year these thing you hear u talking about of investing to expand manufacturing and technology a an advantage or building out and taking advantage of the reach of our sale channel These are all structural advantage are to play in our favor over the long actually argue theyve been benefiting you here in the nearterm a well check clearly show the one out there continues to have good availability of part and it helped some of your nearterm but couldnt agree with you more about the longer want to stay on of the cyclical recovery because you had very strong growth in your it but it the in multiple quarter you actually saw yearoveryear growth to your point you highlighted a down for both and embedded for the data look despite whats a better than feared this and embedded are still to be flat to slightly down yearoveryear for the full calendar would argue down on down bodes well for next but how are you seeing it always careful on WSTs only because to get the done and also to triangulate to the company themselves it consistent when you at the bottomsup performance for the number you described what reflects and close to this where the COVID mix driven consumption so a stronger growth in the computing market be it work from home learn from home Those thing have obviously benefited automotive market lost one could argue or three month with plant shutdown in North and Europe to tend to average down a bit those are example of contributor of why the total market could be up versus and embedded do agree the indication of where and embedded can continue to grow are to be should be reasonably positive one of the Companyspecific question get often about you is what seems to have been or is the divergence in sort of trajectory between your core and your core embedded with embedded of underperforming here wondering if you could help u walk through what you are the dynamic are driving more importantly of the outlook for embedded of closing relative growth gap with your to use the word of a an adjective in front of embedded because been very clear were not pleased with the performance during and why made change why taken a sharper and done some thing internally on front and even talked during the call and were very careful with stuff this basically when you at the data you saw with embedded in the sign of stabilization and the only reason were careful with describing it way is we want to get this to where embedded is back growing and contributing at the it did for a very long of up until is capable of doing had to make some change ours are to get fixed then but it to take a bit of before we can start to get the consistency of growth back out of where our effort are and were focused on can you help me understand the design cycle in the embedded versus mean one of the great strength of your overall is you play in end market have design cycle can be threeplus year once you get socket you sort of recurring revenue for to year Is embedded a relatively shorter duration market than so new design win can flow into the model more quickly is it about the same is it the easiest and simplest assumption is it about the same can obviously vary a bit depending on if exposure to an automotive market versus industrial or which area you have industrial but to the source of your or to the intent of your assume it the same also why were careful with step one and sign of stabilization then to continue you have to give it a of year to make the sustainable growth back and running again because of the constant you referenced other dynamic added a bit of noise to whats already been a very noisy in your some of the decision made around your distribution strategy wondering if you could set u on of the strategy more importantly the impact you some of your decision might have had on growth over the last of quarter and what might mean for growth in coming quarter break it into a of thing go to the higher strategic objective because do this is to be one of these topic when were talking two three four and five year from now there a good chance were to back and a pivotal change we put in place and it becoming an enormous advantage for u driving growth for the long it because we simply believe if you at a secular trend customer have a growing desire for the convenience and the productivity come from content and commerce being able to take place online yes complemented with technical and commercial skilled people the direction the world want to go it how design engineer want to work how customer want to work so when we sit back and at where the world want to go and been on this path a you for a while call for having close direct relationship with customer not having people or distributor in between you and those customer it is to be it to have a profound impact because you see more you more a a result you have better access to be able to win more because it not filtered or not flowing through other organization so been moving in direction for a long of taking out design win registration and thing is the final a were narrowing down the distributor count and shifting quite a bit of to direct yes a you noted been draining distributorowned inventory for eight straight quarter obviously creates a quote revenue headwind but it doesnt change your real share at the point of consumption youll certainly get back when draining of inventory stop because it depleted which were coming up on we believe those are the classic make the right decision for the long even though it may have a bit of a headwind in the short our team is already excited the data what theyre starting to see and learn and what were able to do with customer is exciting for u you pointed out the big advantage you have is scale one of the way materialized is what done with the Internet and your Youre sort of the Amazon of the space wondering if you could give u an update on the strategy how important is becoming for procurement of future it is back to your point of scale not the but it also the investment made in application engineer and technical salesperson it investment made on internal process we can work on a seamless where the web and direct touch with customer is one and the same had huge upside even in had made investment and done work back in building a what called mass market selling or virtual selling targeted how we deeper into the marketplace we would do it in a virtual way on the web then all of a sudden this called COVID hit in we had the entire sale force already trained on virtual selling it a seamless switch in term of how they were to operate on front those investment are all part of and the benefit we have is we literally have ten of million of visit to ticom more than even our closest competitor in because we simply have a larger portfolio of product a a result if a design engineer to have book mark and to go to the website give the highest probability were to have a part solves your need when you begin a design is a great advantage to have a a combination of mover investing in this way but also the advantage of it a hard for somebody to replicate the breadth of what we have An additional source of noise to the over the last of year been sort of USChina trade tension specifically around Huawei of if you can give u your perspective and how thinking about navigating through the regulatory trade environment over the next of year more importantly when you about Chinas desire for domestic independence on the semiconductor side what might mean for your competitive position in China against domestic Chinese in both the embedded and the so a of thing quickly on off is the ambition of China to build a domiciled semiconductor industry and independent of the world you you can go back year of fiveyear plan and find ambition called out so this is not a new ambition not a new effort certainly more money behind it now and it certainly the amplification a you noted of the USChina trade tension in the of year the effort isnt new the is again a you quite well a lot of investment tends to get aimed at the big call them big shiny object or big identifiable segment of the marketplace a lot of investment in memory or trying to get into advanced logic for processor or app processor or modem or thing along those line market are understood Theyre a lot harder to mobilize on because it about developing ten of thousand of product and it about having global channel to be able to sell those product on a global to be able to make the economics work to comprehend all when you about what risk look still have this fundamental belief China is more opportunity than threat If better product offering better product capability availability pricing convenience those are to win in China because the customer are to be ultimately pragmatic on trying to develop and ship the best product on the regulatory thing if we have those up with Huawei it simple abide by the regulation and you ship if occurs and you deal with those thing Now make a lot of want to take you back to Back then we had a target on the stock of and people thought we were crazy also the people thought you were crazy you bid up National about and bought them for what believe look change in Alpine in your account relative to some of the MA been on in the space of late to get of your perspective of how you see the MA environment for semi then is MA still something you is a good tool for you to use do you still see purchasing your own stock is a better return on your investment message of you lived through it and watched it with u it action we took in and National being the decision a you mentioned we also saw and a great to buy asset and we bought used equipment from Qimonda or a of wafer fabs we were able to get at extraordinary price at you noted on National besides the absolute value sound low forget the exact number but cash flow National generated of purchase price even with the premium still those principle have to hold fast nine year ahead on MA a clear role it can play a with all capital allocation decision you to begin with a comment of it depends you to be disciplined on where money go and what type of return you can get on it Now we do have a luxury a several of your question this morning have highlighted which is ourselves and on the right side of the critical mass line or the right side of the scale line in term of manufacturing in term of product breadth in term of reach of the channel it not we have to go do thing from an MA point of view because we have a choice in order to achieve scale which is a wonderful place for u to be in a a result yes well well continue to be disciplined staying on the capital deployment side of thing question around two other us of your capital which is RD and CapEx on the RD side one of the benefit you have in your model is a you steer more towards industrial and auto those are longer duration asset you can leverage RD dollar over a longer of which should eventually lead to an overall RD burden a a percent of revenue still a downward trajectory not how you about making RD investment but help me understand better dynamic and how we on Wall Street should be thinking about the RD expenditure the way would on RD is it typically get shorthanded and focused on a a percent of revenue get because it how the quick math on a PL model would work our belief in general is we have an opportunity to continue to grow RD comment are correct which is the beauty about even my opening comment about where we want to invest of the competitive advantage we about is diversity and longevity we make investment be it in a part be it in a process technology be it in a piece of manufacturing equipment or a design win if they can live for or year it obvious what the return on investment are to we there opportunity in a very steady consistent way to continue to grow RD keep developing great product and great technology in any one percent may go up or down depending on what the revenue is doing in but advised on the earnings call when COVID to potentially take revenue down we were to have a very steady hand on RD investment because those are and call not something to get distracted on in the near we keep growing want to imply the percent of RD is to down over we operate at a very efficient a you compared to the industry right now to go squeeze further developing great part generate great return and where well focus then on the CapEx front a you pointed out earlier you did a great job buying capacity cheaply back in the sort of of if you can give u an update on sort of the buildout of the shale within our fab and of how we should about you balancing CapEx dollar versus future revenue growth again if remember mentioned the same comment in both RD a well a CapEx and is were to keep a steady hand looking and year out RD and were to do the same with CapEx in the case of CapEx were to have a particular focus on what and through need to so the investment were making in our millimeter facility our fab two a you noted about revenue two and three year from now and then of fouryear from so construction is underway progress is being made had commented it the capital management call last a type revenue assumption is a reasonable assumption to at over the longer would not try to be overly precise with what number would be in any revenue could be up or down it could move around a you is up from we ran for a seven eight or nineyear because we had a higher percent of used equipment made the assumption with six therell be a higher percent of new equipment of there a wiser wiser prediction to make at this particular point the road map well execute to commented earlier in a world where in fact gravity more people outsourcing wafer or outsourcing assembly manufacturing actually believe this is to be a growing advantage over the next year both in term of the cost advantage it give u but also the control of supply chain it give u a lot of this conversation centered on rightfully your scale advantage and have talked about this in the you at the market overall it one of those market in semi doesnt seem to on the surface need to ask you Youre the largest in the space at sort of a market share but always joke the other other other more share than you Ive asked this from to and Ill ask it again Are you seeing a drive by customer to want to deal with fewer supplier who can do more in the space do you ultimately believe should lead to faster than historic share gain for you especially interested in dynamic within the auto industry my careful answer and want to be of precise with this is if you try to go to a is one stop shopping a benefit a design engineer selecting component look for believe is the case Meaning whoever a mass is a bunch of stuff win more If you at where we spend our and the thing we do to make it easy and convenient design engineer can find what theyre looking for be able to evaluate it easily test it and then get it into production if you do well you can make scale an advantage hope make in describing it way of a smaller fable competitor those a good part and get to the customer theyre to design it in the beauty of the on front if you about the point of scale we take advantage of believe our competitor are to build millimeter manufacturing because they have the revenue size alone the experience to go do They have the revenue size to have the package variety they would have to have a a result they outsource their assembly They have the revenue size so they cant have the application sale team or the investment in ticom online commerce or make the investment in process to make all work together internally it is scale enables it but to turn it into something highly valued by the customer to make it work were coming up to the end of in the session but wanted to end with one final always prided yourself on the bed strength the organization earlier this you sort of reinstated the COO role wondering if you could spend a few minute talking about succession and how we on Wall Street should be thinking about it one of these thing when in when came back from my short sabbatical you and many others asked what the frame and it simple is it be however long it take to have a great leader can give u another or shift and love the technology love the people love the work get to do but where were heading the other and again had the chance to meet a lot of people at over the year other one is the fun part about what get to do but more importantly for confidence to investor is at the caliber of leader we have if you keep meeting next down over the and year so when we had the opportunity to promote Haviv to the COO role he is a terrific leader in term of his technical capability his urgency his competitiveness his thoughtfulness all the thing youd want in a great leader equally important and not and investor havent had a chance to get down to Dallas recently but the team he reporting into him and the team underneath they keep getting better after a well because had people growing up of the system and they keep getting better at it couldnt be more pleased with what the lineup look and what the inevitable support in term of a great team know where were trying to go life the strategy live the value represent so were in a very strong position on front Perfect with appreciate the conversation this morning a always very insightful want to you and everyone who joined u virtually also want to pas along our wish you your immediate family and a importantly the larger family continues to stay safe and healthy in whats been a very challenging you and saying back to your entire team and everybody else out there Hopefully the miracle of vaccine in the pharma industry are to get u back to some semblance of normal and we all to you Have a good day',\n",
       "       'well go ahead and take our from with afternoon and for taking the my is on automotive saw very strong result in the you spoke to a sequential increase in revenue in the automotive end market Whats your view on a it relates to automotive how are you thinking about sustainability into the early part of then Ive a quick followup sequential obviously very strong but it best explained at looking at the previous a we talked about last the majority of the automotive revenue is on consignment a the North American and European manufacturer had closed plant revenue reacted very quickly and we were down and yearonyear and so a those factory opened up we saw the bottom in we expected revenue to grow and a they opened up obviously revenue reacted very quickly in the other direction the story we saw in Again a given color last on the automotive market and talked about how moving significantly in the were not breaking out any particular end market or color on front there not a reason to a we into the you have a followon do followup is on margin in you mentioned margin were down point on a yearoveryear trying to better understand what the put and take were Overall revenue up mix of business improved with up yearoveryear embedded processing down inch versus eight and so guessing inch up yearoveryear trying to understand what the negative were on a yearoveryear drove margin down a bit appreciate you run your for margin but you no happy to answer yeah on a yearonyear revenue up margin dollar were up but a le than maybe or so but when looking at such a big number then the delta is so small it difficult to at the pullthrough we normally at it right in the big scheme of thing revenue up a bit and margin dollar were up a bit having would also point out the mix of personal electronics revenue higher in than it been what it the same last or even we’ll go to next please take our next from with you a followup on the last point on the strength in personal electronics a you out to how do you feel about inventory versus end demand sellthrough then a part of and perhaps other segment a well how you about Huawei in term of perhaps last shipment there and how seeing a you go me go ahead and start and then can address the Huawei or anything else at the highest we are very wellpositioned to handle whatever come at u whether it personal electronics or any other market personal electronics is one by having the inventory strategy we have followed having optionality we have talked about for now day or so the last two quarterly release put u in a good position Now is not having of tactical strategy it also or tactical position also having the strategic position of being the supplier of catalog part are highly diversified sell to many many customer have over different customer sell different part it put u in a position where we can build the inventory have the asymmetric bet so if our revenue strong we can support it If it not then we hold inventory a longer than usual it a working capital also want to make the point inventory we very it a strategic asset we have talked about earlier were comfortable holding high level of inventory in fact were to update were to give you an update on our on inventory at the next capital management call in Ill make the comment on Huawei Huawei about of our revenue in the a higher than what they were in the half of certainly were in compliance with export restriction and stopped shipping to them on and they are not included in our revenue guidance do you have a followon for all the color there guess how you about a the rebound from an OpEx perspective any put and take there for and into next Nothing significant would point to OpEx of course RD is a big part of about a a big component of our competitive advantage of having the broadest portfolio in the industry continue to put out some of the best product catalog product go into automotive industrial personal electronics communication market well continue to strengthen advantage Another one go in OpEx in the GA portion in the SGA portion is the investment were making in ticom to strengthen the reach of our channel we continue to strengthen tool ability to reach channel reach customer better and keeping them engaged longer and selling more and more product to those customer at the highest OpEx been running a on a would expect for to run at above maybe over up or yearonyear but in neighborhood you we’ll go to the next please take our next from with for taking my question the one wanted to touch on the strength from PE wanted to if you can give u a more color on how much of would be PCs versus smartphones you had talked about some of strength coming from your ability to satisfy unexpected demand assume maybe more a statement but any color you could give u on sort of the relative mix and growth of those two subend market would be helpful a the pandemic started back in and even in last a lot of the strength initially driven by PCs and tablet we have strength broaden so even to TVs and smart speaker and other thing are used in the home our best estimate or guesstimate of whats on is a people are spending more at home theyre upgrading the thing theyre using more spend is broadening beyond the a talking about our portfolio of product serf u well and put u in a position to be able to support demand Do you have a followon do you talking about continuing to hold high inventory level and maintaining high service into and beyond and get want to if you could give u any color on what implies for your utilization and loading assuming your utilization up in in mean u if the case what are your plan for utilization factory loading a we go into and the end of the a you we only about utilization when there a big inflection point or something unusual we did about it in into because most people most other vertical competitor decreased their loading instead we kept them flat at point to to maintain option to have optionality frankly served u tremendously well during these last six month Since we have biased up our loading so we did from to a higher and to well bias up we are biasing up higher nothing significant it is biased up so we maintain optionality and we can maximize revenue and support our customer with any potential upside they have are also would be unsupported otherwise you go to the next please take our next from with a lot guess my is on the share buyback quite small even lower than in the depth of the financial crisis back in Yet your already snapped back a lot Whats the thinking there always been astute about the intrinsic value of your stock so how should investor sort of read me step back and everybody how we about cash return we about this during capital management every in and when we meet with investor when we about cash return the objective there is to return all cash flow to the owner of the via buyback and dividend use both if you at in the last on a which is the best way to at we have generated of cash flow and have returned more than the generation so well ahead of the generation the return been Do you have a followup did did wanted to doubleclick a bit on the dropthrough in seemed the dropthrough in embedded fine but still a below where the op margin back in sort of the late frame at sort of similar level Is there something on with mix Is maybe the PE mix you were talking about before within Theres nothing unusual there to comment is the biggest we have anything we would comment at the applies likely came from they have a fair amount of PE impact a disproportionate amount of personal electronics given embedded doesnt have much personal electronics so yes embedded is essentially industrial and automotive for the most part Probably of those two where growth would from you and we’ll go to the next please take our next from with afternoon job on the quarterly you give u the quarteronquarter and yearoveryear trajectory by geography theyre shipped to location but it still useful a a proxy for demand and overall economic activity depending on the breadth of the Asia up and all of the other region were down all of the region were up and Japan down Do you have a followon you mentioned last there may have been some industrial customer were building some inventory to potentially buffer against future supply chain disruption and prudent continuity planning Did you continue to see in are these customer starting to work down these inventory or sustaining the higher level a we head into the winter month and flu season our comment last were one more of an observation of history in our industry basically it taught u whenever supply constraint customer react by building some inventory it our belief it would be naive this would be the wouldnt happen right those supply constraint in our industry still exist to extent could still be the case now our lead time have stable product availability is still very high you can go to ticom and get immediate availability of over different device doesnt mean we have pocket of delivery problem always have at any overall our lead time are very solid availability is high but not true for the industry yes it would be naive to believe wouldnt be the case you go to the next please next come from with afternoon for me ask some question on the solid result if you at of your guidance over the last two quarter it look you sort of rightfully discounted of what the bottomsup booking telling u a much when you guided for the given the magnitude of beat in it of feel the same way to me seems to make in the midst of a global pandemic of guiding the to plus or minus about seasonal inclusive of what sound a point headwind from Huawei guess could argue maybe phone build started a bit later this should help guess a you forecast the seasonal of the metric you were for are you discounting of your bottomsup in the a much in hindsight a you did in and covered a lot of good point you point out in any there put and take the headwind of Huawei the unwind of the distributor program which in fact actually wound up this and with the growing demand and the inventory need and position essentially completed we depleted about a mentioned about worth of inventory in always put and take Ill tell you the most important we see and the most important input we get is the demand our customer tell u they want we get from the order in the backlog our customer provide u a well a demand fee we get through consignment so is what drive and informs the outlook we provide you have a followon it fair to there been nothing typical this but you and have talked about this in the If you at the yearoveryear growth discrepancy between and embedded it fairly wide wondering now were day more into this of difference in yearoveryear growth is there a good explanation in your mind importantly a we when do you expect the embedded to of catch up to on a over certainly the embedded isnt performing the way we would want it to over the last multiple quarter if you over the most recent here certainly were encouraged by the progress or the number would show been working very hard on turning around and getting it performing we would it to be performing were making investment there because we believe it be a great contributor in the coming year and so were busy building stronger and but it take success in be not measured over this or even over a of quarter but be measured over you for with we go to the next please next come from with wanted to followup on same last of Johns on the embedded side of thing last where embedded weak and yearoveryear weak you talked about the overindexing to automotive and industrial given automotive up a surprised embedded basically the same a from a sequential perspective there some offset in you industrial down a bit but it doesnt seem it would be enough to offset overindexing on the excuse me on the Automotive side embedded grew a faster than essentially a last a you pointed out it didnt have any offset to the Essentially all you have left is industrial it those two end market so with the return of revenue it performing about the same a is those are the two those are the two component driving it doesnt have nearly a much PE or in fact hardly any PE personal electronics personal electronics a big contributor to growth in sequential growth right right Do you have a followon guess my followup If can pivot over to the industrial side a higherlevel seem to be flat to up yeartodate in your industrial do you explain the actual growth in versus the global GDP and the general economic activity dropping doesnt seem the inventory concern are a high a what you had last where you it would be naive to otherwise seems some of those concern have gone by the wayside but still nonetheless outperforming the global economy If it not inventory guess what is it the longerterm thesis of course is content is expanding of those market if you below we talked about there area of strength and there area of weakness if you at certain market aerospace and defense is obviously weak people arent taking delivery of plane a an example Theres other area of strength appliance If anyone listening on the call is doing any home renovation my wife is you have to wait multiple month to to get home appliance so were seeing very very strong strength in those type of area but the diversity of market coupled with the content expansion prof out why it such an attractive market for u our product are tailormade and well positioned to take advantage of market Right the other would add is listen we have different customer different product majority of those sell in to industrial is the most diverse end market itd be impossible for u to what those customer are doing and what add up to important part is the way we run the to give ourselves the highest possible optionality so if it is driven by secular trend or asset is driven by the secular trend over the long haul maybe any one it could or two quarter it could oscillate it could be inventory building over the long those secular trend are there and we put ourselves in a good position tactically to have inventory to support our customer if we have a correction inventory correction or something of sort well go through inventory not go back not go back have it in storage for year and then well sell it at the other end of of whatever correction we may have you Raf go to the next please next come from with you wanted to ask Johns a bit differently Does it feel booking are not to back to reflecting true end demand this everything been abnormal right a about your guidance is it safe to booking are now running very much aligned with end demand always a we have precise insight to right have a system tell u you have to even go back to where the market had turned through a classic inventory cycle worked our way through through a we bottomed out and saw sign of inflection COVID hit of changed thing but certainly we started this with inventory at lower level so certainly where we started the right but inventory and demand are certainly tied together so believe they were ever largely disconnected over so much of our is on consignment or justintime demand the booking versus revenue trend is not meaningful right it almost what inventory our customer have downstream so why we from an optionality standpoint try to ensure product if thing want to continue to strengthen from here were in a position to support it the posture were taking If it doesnt we certainly what to do in the other direction a well have a followon fair you communication is smaller for you and it may even be le of a strategic end market for you but it did take a sequential breather still up yearoveryear Directionally do you have any view on where market is headed it our longerterm thesis is is it not a structural grower there not new subscriber being added to the network overall made investment in and well benefit from it a you it not a very large portion of our revenue Certainly there noise in this quarter number with Huawei but growth resume a it always everyone in the industry describes it a a choppy market and doesnt make it a bad market it make it choppy so well continue investment there a good market for u well continue to make investment in it and we continue to it you for one last please take our last from with for squeezing me in and had a on the industrial a well clearly it seemingly very resilient if back at the cycle is it also because and you at it very longterm a well for four consecutive quarter and for the full it down is this because a we and you mentioned in an answer to an earlier is when we entered the it the supply chain drained out of any excess because of what you have so now we are despite all the problem and the demand collapsing in certain end market and industrials it held in also because of factor the supply chain inventory lean completed seven quarter of yearonyear decline is the of yearonyear growth had industrials been a piece of those yearonyear decline a good part of our industry cyclicality a you pointed out but structurally industrial with it breadth and if you sector were investing in of them are have content growing so were were very positioned positioned very well to be able to support growth what we cant call and what we is in the shortterm how the economy is to behave even in a weak environment market done reasonably well compared to some of the other market have a followon a quick one on the Embedded side last earnings call also you mentioned encouraged by the sign of stabilization wanted to help u understand what are some of the step you have taken to ride the a it doesnt happen overnight you talked about investment and several year you you were to deemphasize comms infrastructure because longer you didnt see growth there at least on the comms on the Embedded side is the investment profile in this looking a bit different a you what are some of the other step you have taken to ride the and get it back on track yes so highlighted a of step we have taken in the none of those have been secret decision on the comms side something we had talked about back six seven year now a we didnt believe comms equipment to be a structural grower specifically on the Embedded side we did believe there some opportunity on the side so we took up investment there were enjoying the benefit of those investment on the side but did provide a headwind talked about it a of quarter now the some of the restructuring you mentioned of the Embedded eight different product group and we took down some of the resource in some and took up some of the resource in others getting resource on to the best opportunity overall and making we have resource into the place we believe be the best growth opportunity in general what were trying to do is leverage our competitive advantage ensure the product we are investing in have a broadbased appeal in a customer base standpoint and theyll be product generate cash flow for a long to taking a step back again were investing in because we believe it be a great contributor when we at the year ahead so so again there a lot of effort into building stronger but it take success would be measured over year not in a or two with Ill turn it over to to wrap u up for the night me wrap up by emphasizing what we have previously our core were engineer and technology is the foundation of our ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate longterm value for our owner is the growth of cash flow per share strategy to maximize cash flow per share growth three element great model focused on and Embedded Products and built around four sustainable competitive advantage two discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunity and lastly efficiency which mean constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent While we strive to achieve our objective we continue to pursue our three ambition act owner who own the for decade adapt and succeed in a world ever changing we be a we are personally proud to be a part of and would want a our neighbor were successful our employee customer and community and owner all benefit you and have a good concludes today call you for your may now',\n",
       "       'take our from with go ahead for taking my question have you still mentioned you some of your industrial customer are trying to build guess inventory and making their own position is still strong if your lead time are short and you are building you have product are ready to ship why would any of your customer actually have any need to prebuy anything if so do you what you are seeing right now is maybe more indicative of what the actual end demand state might Like how do we square circle it a good you a we have talked about last we saw some unusual order pattern we talked about revenue running up strong into and thing abating they certainly didnt abate a we thought they would saw supply constraint across the industry and sometimes a customer order a they at building inventory our visibility end at their dock when we ship them product they may decide to build some finished good inventory so we have visibility into not a number we can into a system to provide u more instinct and experience and also talking to our field team and getting input from standpoint when we at the number what it is telling u to add to a few comment out of our or so customer guess to of those are in industrial right it frankly difficult to draw conclusion with such a huge number of customer have different idiosyncrasy in the way they behave other would tell you is if am a purchasing manager at one of these customer and am ordering different part for a board are they to treat certain supplier a differently than others if they decided to build inventory to stock up and feel safer not right another dynamic may be you should take into account not in all case Right Not in all case there is some of and the caution would provide have a followup Stacey guess to followup on a bit if at of the trajectory you have had over the last few quarter you are above seasonal exauto you were above seasonal your guide is of at the low end of seasonal but of roughly mean so far at least outside of auto it doesnt seem the pandemic is having any real impact on you at all find it a surprising what are you hearing from your customer if anything a to effect in term of what they are seeing and the impact the pandemic is having on the supply chain a far a can tell it not having much impact on you at all guess which is good you the number we have turned in down right it up exauto right Correct unfortunately we have to report the number with auto in well is the reality and auto down you is real the auto manufacturer closed down because of COVID wouldn’t quite go so far to it didnt have an impact you if you of you saw strength in some area the work from home trend PCs and tablet and server from the of enterprise right we are seeing some strength due to which is also driving there is some thing are moving around we saw the other if you longer a we entered the a you we described back in we were seeing sign of stabilization with the result a we had worked our way through the bottom of the cycle are starting to see those sign of stabilization Now with those sign of stabilization again we turned in a down overall those are the result and we do have to report the number all in but it is important we wanted to give the color of auto because the driver of the weakness from the go to the next please you hear now from with of go ahead for taking my wanted to actually pick up from point on automotive am or what you are expecting your automotive to do in when at your auto sale you mentioned down over They are of in line with unit picking on one is not representative of the trend but some of your auto peer they benefited from content growth and so forth my is what do you about the broader automotive market heading into do you you can start to get back to a point where you get some content growth on top of whatever unit recovery we might see a great clarification obviously what we are reporting is our shipment factory close they stop taking product for our revenue overall a large portion of our revenue overall are on consignment there is not inventory sitting between u and those manufacturing line general describe the automotive market a being a more mature supply chain those supply chain react faster than let an industrial supply chain would perhaps so when those factory open back on they begin to pull those unit we wont try to predict what the overall market is to do can measure when customer are pulling demand confidence in content growth three and five year from now in automobile remains very high but try to draw the dot of a cyclical recovery we wont spend trying to do do you have followon on the factory plan recall you mentioned you expect your factory plan in to be the same a and we saw inventory go up in What do you your inventory level do in what am trying to do is try to align your guidance seems to be seasonal a asked before even the of outlook seems to be very in line with normal guidance but your commentary seems to be more conservative certainly visibility on the macro side seems to be a more difficult am trying to get a better for what your plan for production in tell u about your visibility on to your end customer and the of demand a of thing the environment continues to be uncertain want to make clear remain cautious how this economy behave for the next several year is very important is part of the way we are looking at this the same we want to keep our optionality maximize our optionality what mean is be able to meet unforecasted demand from our customer we did in and we plan to continue in and beyond reason we can do strategically we are very well positioned part we sell tends to be the majority of them catalog part sell to many many customer last a long long if we end up building inventory inventory is not to go bad have to scrap it play very well in our favor Essentially it a very symmetrical bet we are making where the upside is high the downside is limited we are to continue operating way great you go to the next please you hear now from with for taking the and congrats on the wanted to go back to performance or performance by in it a significant beat in term of revenue very much for giving color on a sequential and a yearoveryear relative to what you are thinking internally where did the beat from Was it broadbased or it focused in one or two business in general if you at the area of strength we had certainly in area were driven by the work from home the PCs tablet the server those were area we saw strength Automotive obviously when thing shut down they shut down had turned off much a light switch a the number would show of industrial you have the number of down or the or so from a transition standpoint yes definitely the strength we saw we had in the work from home area have a followon do you MA is clearly topical in the group right now and hoping you can u whats sort of the criterion is when it come to MA for you at sort of a twopart Is it fair to your posture is a bit more conservative or cautious given the current macro and geopolitical backup a well a where evaluation lie is it much a usual for you on the MA front you a good and it interesting the way you framed it me maybe everybody our framework acquisition we consider need to meet two criterion it need to be a good strategic fit an with catalog part differentiated part then go into auto and industrial because where we focus a where the content growth is happening and would align well with our strategy the next piece is price need to make is after once you make the purchase in three four five year are you meeting the cost of capital are you beating the cost of capital of it on a cash on cash standpoint Invest and my cost of capital is when am to get after tax on investment beat and get or over is our criterion the one we have had for many year and we continue to have it your part of your frankly in an environment we are through this is a great to make the most of opportunity we are not conservative are following the same framework we have followed based on framework we are evaluating MA opportunity but more importantly we are continuing to invest internally are making our competitive advantage stronger continue to invest in RD havent scaled back at all continue to invest in thing ticom and our retail market channel of course our manufacturing and technology where we broke ground on the new facility the new the RFAB in Richardson and we are to investing to have building ready over the next to month we continue to do to strengthen the and now is a great to do it are very well positioned from a balance sheet standpoint from a PL cash flow standpoint a lot better than our competitor it a good to take advantage of you go to the next please you hear from with go ahead a lot for me ask a and congrats on the strong result wanted to go into the source of the upside and you talked about the work from home side everybody understands why better the big still outstanding to me is the sustainability of can you about the upside surprise do you is sustainable you are not guiding by end market never do how do you envision the half of the in those same area upsided when we at our longer we at where we are investing for growth Industrial and automotive is where the investment go especially industrial where we expect growth to be you when we at three and five and growth perhaps for next of decade we believe growth is very sustainable and where we are focused some of the growth we are seeing is due because of the optionality talked about how have recently updated our customer product we have immediate availability on if demand is the sustainable in the half we have the product to ship into any of our market overall in the short our long prospect are whats more important Do you have a followon do for answer want to switch over to the two product segment the two main one and embedded wanted to see if there is any update on your view on the embedded side you there a bit of a restructuring built into gain guess a a bit of an offset the big picture is you are now down to the lowest percentage of sale embedded been since at least in my model of the yearoveryear decline is so much larger than the side can you a bit about when do you bottom out What sort of restructuring need to be done do you is a growth driver over for the is it something we should envision a remaining a much smaller part of the than it once when we at the embedded the embedded market a we talked about before it share many of the attribute the market and we believe it be it been and continue to be a contributor to cash flow growth you at and at the share gain it had at and the better part of it had share gain gave some of back in of course here more recently we talked about last you saw some sequential growth out of all in talked about the fact without auto you would have sequential growth in this we are seeing sign of stabilization of we have taken action to strengthen to dive into have across microcontrollers and processor there is eight business Three of them actually we have increased resource of them we have actually decreased resource three of them have stayed about the same portfolio management you have u take across our business over the year we do believe be a contributor to cash flow is a lot of the work on to ensure it is you very much go to the next you hear from with go ahead you mentioned you thought there is some inventory buildout there believe you it in industrial you give u a of how much do you helped what give you confidence it not occurring in any other product line did you notice anything any of strength by certain geography out there you you have heard u you have heard me multiple time in the joked have never once taken a double order or an order for an inventory build obviously customer mark it way when they send an order in is something we cant see have talked about before with of our revenue on consignment we have inventory of our product sitting in front of the manufacturing line our visibility end right there we have a system tell u if customer are building inventory when you at the number and you at the strength and you add thing up what our intuition tell u we are mindful of it important to point out could it be in other area could be our belief is it not significant but we it important to point it out me add to point on the customer side me you of the distribution side where we do have visibility we drain of distributorowned inventory on top of the we drained last so far yeartodate it and we we be able to drain another or so for the rest of the we end up draining or so of inventory make a lot of given the change in distribution we are making are bringing more customer direct then we can control inventory be essentially on our balance sheet a we build more inventory on our balance sheet so we can support those customer direct other comment make regarding given drain now we only have about three week of inventory in the districhannel down about a week from the prior tell you metric is already le meaningful than it before and it continue to be le meaningful a we make distribution channel smaller over wanted to give the data point so you have it Do you have a followup on last statement you you have three week of inventory in the districhannel guess if we at your day of inventory right now it mean balance sheet look the fed from a glance Should we expect this to be the new normal right around day should this be the same dollar guess what should we sort of calibrate our model to for inventory at few comment is a the distributionowned inventory we have been draining for seven quarter in a row if you at the entire ecosystem right including the distribution inventory plus our inventory over the last year seven or eight quarter is relatively flat right you have to it make we it make to about it way then the other angle a mentioned earlier and we talked about it in our remark is the great optionality having inventory give u we showed in and we continue to do it because it is an asymmetric bet having inventory there is a working capital cost associated with the scrap risk on is low yet the potential upside of serving our customer well with very low lead time in many case a we immediate availability we longer is something customer do and continue to appreciate you go to the next please you take our next from from you very much apologize for the background noise Economic activity is humming around where live margin the margin much higher than what a normal fall through model would suggest wondering is it a factor of how low embedded is and the mix contributing to the margin being so strong this is there something else on your utilization flat quarteronquarter What would tell you a we have guided for many year you should of revenue coming in and out at to a good guide to use over the entire cycle Of course any one could be a more or a le then over the longer of course millimeter and continuing to add revenue on millimeter a structural cost advantage help our margin continue to be a tailwind on margin been and continue to be Do you have followon do Back to microcontrollers embedded now you have been looking at the data and am you have been looking at it before it good to see stabilizing and you are seeing some sign of stabilization especially how low it is Is there some insight you could provide u between the connected and the processor side would help explain the divergence we have from the overall over the last not three year a you were pointing out if we back at three year only in the last six or seven quarter Has it been diverging from the industry is not much difference in the trend between microcontrollers and the processor if you at the longer trend line and what share doesnt move around quickly of those business whether it or embedded overall and then if you drop down into microcontrollers or processor again if you at of and and the three quarter of those business did have a real strong track record of share gain and the deterioration began to happen in where it gained some of back again we are taking the action to strengthen believe what we are doing get performing and having it to be a strong contributor to cash flow you we have for one more please you take our next from with for squeezing me in is very slow moving but long relatively meaningful risk a it relates to China trying to develop a domestic strong semiconductor capability Some might argue given the current state of affair both economically and politically perhaps there could be some acceleration in regard recently am hoping you might update u a to what you are seeing from this competitive threat to give you some thought on of in a way similar a we of our competitor meaning our competitive advantage put u in a good place to compete against American European competitor a well a the Chinese having one our own manufacturing with millimeter put u give u structural cost advantage other one is the broadest portfolio in the industry close to different part particularly relevant with industrial and automotive where in the case of industrial for example there are different customer right you want to be able to have the entire suite of part in the space and embedded space make it more likely they buy from you it make the investment on the sale side more worthwhile and then with the diverse and longlived position result into partially because of those advantage and the way is structured it difficult to go after space right what we have where company in China anywhere where they go after is the of vertical market in place memory or digital space is frankly easier to go after easier to get revenue growing quickly and then you can reinvest and go from there the space we have average price in the to Embedded is higher than but not much higher hard then the different customer you go after the different part is a daunting task right not impossible we are very respectful of and our job is to stay ahead of all our competitor no matter where they are American European Asian we continue investing in in those advantage in manufacturing in the broad portfolio in the reach of channel to make climb even harder every Do you have a followup appreciate answer sound there is no meaningful change recently in this threat relative to any others wanted to followup on the distribution commentary around another of inventory to go we about the the down in the and you left in the back half Should we about a proportional to the amount or to the percentage of distribution to transition this is still on track to finish by the end of the it is on track to finish by the end of the what happens there is by the end of the we are have a much smaller distribution footprint the number of distributor we engage with at the same we have transitioned a fair amount of customer to shipping direct with lesser distribution we deal with fewer distributor then more of our revenue direct is yes guess it is proportional to drain of inventory you are referring to it also includes reduction in inventory of the distributor be with u a well am glad you mentioned yes so part of what reduction is is the distributor we are to stay with for the most part they be on full consignment anything we sell with them and there a few exception in Japan for example but other than they be in full consignment they are to have zero own inventory for the most part is also reflected in the the last me wrap up by summarizing what we have previously continue to invest in and strengthen our four competitive advantage which are manufacturing and technology portfolio breadth market reach and diverse and longlived product also continue to pursue our three ambition act owner who own the for decade adapt in a world ever changing we be a we are personally proud to be part of and would be proud to have a a neighbor we are successful our employee customer community and owner all benefit you very much you today you all for your may now',\n",
       "       'with welcome to maybe kick it off perhaps give u a state of the union in term of what so far in term of any near demand or supply impact from the COVID pandemic then we go into longer trend of all for inviting and having u appreciate maybe to frame thing and many of listen to our earnings call and not providing any update from call all the reference be from what we saw at point to put in context a we operate the there’s three thing we want to keep in mind is the is we want to operate the a owner and owner with a longterm investment horizon other two ambition adapt and change and certainly with COVID coming having ability to be able to move quickly is important the last is having a proud to work at and would want to have a a labor if we can do those three thing all of our constituent our owner and employee of the we all benefit we talked about when we at the environment more to your we back to and the GFC is the most recent exogenous event happened to at to learn from not because we believe the shape of this curve and trying to get into the debate of the shape of the curve but a model of we could learn from so were taking learning informing how were running the operation from learning into our decision on continuing our OpEx investment in RD a we talked about in the call keeping those steady also from a CapEx standpoint CapEx were investing in this is mainly into infrastructure investment have capacity implication in the timeframe those are also remaining remain steady were not trying to predict what the shape of the curve look here a in the nearterm and what the recovery trying to from an operational standpoint ensure a many option to support curve and be ready for whatever the economy is to throw at u what were trying to do a a management team here in the shortterm Then maybe to of go one deeper in how is from a supply perspective Are you able to fulfill all customer order Have you any disruption from a supply perspective then we about the different demand side driver we had on our call and he framed it a luck is when opportunity meet preparation we were for the unforeseen event the COVID provided back in late a the industry struggling to meet supply many of our peer had to extend lead time or had difficulty with supply a we saw some of unusual order pattern from our customer we actually put a communication out on our towards the end of and we recently updated it in still out on the main page of our if anyone is interested in what communication basically try to reassure customer the product lead time remain stable for three thing you and have had many discussion about how we view inventory and the importance of it and how the action taken to own and control inventory and investment made there we came into this with a good position on inventory number one is is we own and control our manufacturing facility we’ve a dozen wafer fabs a half a dozen assembly test site Those not by accident are in geographically diverse location so allows u to have the which is a very robust continuity plan a the world go into lockdown and a New York had more restrictive lockdown requirement than Dallas there are part of the Philippines a an example we two assembly test site in the Philippines Those were near Malaysia were different than our operation in Baguio and part are multisourced across those site allowed u to continue to keep our lead time study and offer product to our customer Got it in term of the different end market driver from a demand perspective appreciate auto is weak across the board for everyone outside of auto can you give u some qualitative of what held up better and what been worse than expectation so far this even to put it into context it helpful to even go back to of when we saw demand begin to weaken cyclically a you we’re working our way and trying to find a bottom we began to see what we saw described if you remember in a sign of stabilization in of we started the a normal a whatever a normal can be from a demand standpoint a we moved into some chart we at revenue on a we at Chinese New Year revenue in and coming out clearly very weak a we came out of Chinese New Year a factory in China struggled to back online because of COVID then a we moved into mentioned earlier we began to see some unusual order activity a customer concern due to the supply constraint and unusual order activity and strength continued into early the only exception there and described a broadbased the only exception of course automotive Automotive factory began closing around the world because of COVID in after about the week or so in we then began to see thing decelerate broadly our assumption thing would continue to decelerate through the and such would be weaker than or would be weaker than essentially how you get to the midpoint of the guidance of course were in the of uncertainty and we put a plus or minus confidence interval around midpoint given the uncertainty were to finish up the a we normally do we update how thing have gone so far this Got it last when you saw one of your competitor positively preannounce your reaction yes make or it doesnt make any sense” read those report read them in the last a they came out so well put all in context guess when we report fair next topic wanted to discus with you is the whole USChina trade tension dynamic you are one of the largest semiconductor company the largest one in for Give u a for how these trade tension have impacted you so far then need to change anything to take into account these new restriction the Department of Commerce is trying to put on the industry so at the highest we would rather see both of our government working together to get the GDP growing in both economy and the world economy versus the direction were our describes it a no one call him to have him influence in direction we are likely not to have a strong voice in outcome and he is also a student of world history if you’ve studied world history a he if a rising economic power challenging and existing economic power those are trade tension or tension in general last for decade our job is over it and figure out how to be successful in environment and not wait for some trade agreement or some agreement is hopefully to solve all the problem More specifically there’s been a of different recent ruling and regulation have out from the commerce department here most recent of which fairly narrowly targeted and they directly impact u They could secondarily impact u meaning the one specifically impact Huawei and Hisilicon but they directly impact u can you u of what the remaining exposure is to Huawei imagine it very modest let in the hypothetical or which could be real if let Huawei cannot build it own base station or it smartphones have any significant impact on last Huawei a to customer there were to customer in a well if you remember the shape the comms equipment market for u or it grew very strongly had a very strong back half and a very strong half ‘ and then accelerated from there and about twothirds of Huawei revenue tied into comms equipment market it exited started much higher than a to and exited much lower a you might expect Got it Is there any indirect exposure you might be shipping to somebody who might ship to Huawei and some other trying to get… inclusive inclusive of if we ship to a distributor if what you mean or a thirdparty manufacturer is channel independent number yes Got it a it relates to the trade tension is Chinas desire to become more selfsufficient in semiconductor Have you any share shift to their domestic supplier Do you risk grow for over a someone is an of the and thinking about our competitive advantage certainly a risk to be on the radar screen something you about because of the competitive moat are around dynamic of the market the diversity of the revenue and the product set the structure of the market itself it not something where market share move quickly not something sneak up on anyone it not the type of place where big government can spend big dollar to move quickly into our industry right typically memory market or processor or basebands or those big shiny object in our industry where government and region of the world have moved no we havent any evidence of it again it’s beyond the list not something you would want to ignore it not something would happen overnight Got it we have discussed this issue a few time before itd be helpful for the audience to understand what is so hard about someone in China find it tougher to copy because it doesnt use the most leading edge manufacturing what is so tough about raise the barrier to entry in a lot of one of the thing is the diversity right we’ve product in our portfolio have plus customer you at the requirement of any one product and you drive down into power a an example and any system have a varying number of semiconductor component on it depending on how many part and what part are on piece of electronics those part have different voltage requirement and different current requirement drive the need for different power chip to supply the right current and voltage to it which then drive the diversity of power product by it very nature drive the diversity the number of product you need to develop technology are developed are not standard so if you to the technologist from our team or from our peers’ team theyll go into great detail of why the technology is very unique and it brings u competitive advantage which it the key is it unique cant use industry standard tool to develop our product our peer and someone in China could also develop those product but our engineer couldnt go to someone el design shop and do the same and use the same tool because they exist where on the digital side we’re using nanometer or nanometer or nanometer digital process technology using tool from standard design tool from Cadence or Mentor Synopsys those type of company you can go from one semiconductor to the next and to use the same tool and the same basic process technology to output it need to what factory you’re to output it to you are to build it on in factory are to use the exact same manufacturing process flow from tool company are all developing on the same material and the same material science there a lot more standardization on the digital side than what there is on the side oftentimes the design and process side in is described a an art where on the digital side it is more of a science because on the digital side only looking for zero and one outcome all can be abstracted and therefore can be put into a tool where on the side those designer have to be down at very very low level cant be automated Is and an engineer the fact do a decent job of trying to summarize could add any color to it because good at it a well Absolutely it been a while since Ive been at engineering but it make absolute to the other part important part of your on the embedded side Last we saw a very big discrepancy between or big delta between your which down somewhere in the mid teen versus at least for the the broader microcontroller industry down closer to of the what explains big delta and do you reverse at some point give u a back on why there big share shift last because it much bigger than what we have at any other previous then what it take to of get back in line or even get back to TI’s historical trend which been of taking share in those market and it’s a good point a you at in particular you almost have to go back to the previous of year where ‘ ‘ and three quarter of ‘ there a significant amount of outperformance and began of ‘ and through there some share given back in embedded market microcontrollers or processor because the performance wasnt much difference between either one of those share doesnt move very quickly over measured over longer period of real cautious to make a comment about even one one you at over of performance is more stable certainly work to do to ensure performance over longer period of do continue to we do continue to gain point point of share we’re good solid roadmaps of product customer want engaging with customer doing the basic blocking and tackling you have to do in those business what were focused on and the team there a lot of attention being brought to bear on Got it Got it you help maybe our audience on what the different part are of your embedded and which part were perhaps in more competitive situation last about is connected microcontroller is in processor there not much of a performance difference between the two of those connected microcontrollers a the word the description would give it we support across product family about a dozen wireless standard everything from WiFi to Bluetooth to ZigBee to a Zwave to Thread to you want to name the alphabet soup of our team much support it a well a our host of wired standard our industry get excited about all the wireless stuff and when connecting thing but the wired portion is very important a well for our customer then the processor stuff is also very very important a full array of processor are intended for embedded application in automotive processor do ADAS processing infotainment industrial millimeter wave sensor those type of processor Got it a we at the broader economy starting to open up do you the recovery in your end market be coincident with opening up of the broader economy do you there perhaps some of pullin whereby the recovery in the diversified semiconductor industry would actually lag the recovery in the broader macro economy the simple answer is we cant predict a I’ve of made in my opening remark what were trying to do is make were ready with number one talked about the importance of owning and controlling our inventory in the channel u take action over a number of year to move to consignment where we own and control more of inventory in the channel More recently taken action to go to essentially a single distributor a we exit this give u more control of inventory and more importantly move u closer and have more direct relationship with our customer a we exit this it a great to do transition when demand is weaker and what were doing internally from an inventory standpoint to position ourselves when thing do recover we we wont be able to predict it we can be ready for it when it back when do you the industry would get to a point where one can is the trough of this cycle Do you the industry is there yet we have a of view of not expressed a view have had such somebody NXP who outside of auto their business are growing in could grow again in Microchip obviously expressed a view about do you get into a position where you are able to save somewhat more confidence yes is or is the bottom of the cycle What need to happen and you our style stick to reporting the fact and served u well our style we try to stick to the fact and report them and well stay out of the debate and report what we can see and not enter into speculating on what thing could be that’s served u well in the so we’ll stick with Got it Makes Then on the distribution side bought up so you have adopted a very different strategy versus your peer and you have pulled back a lot from distribution if we at where is in term of the midpoint of your outlook do you it already embeds all the possible headwind in term of pulling back from distribution do you there are some other impact can be felt over the next several quarter were to pull out somewhere between and worth of inventory in the channel between now and the end of the a part of is inclusive of the number Theres more to be done in and a we continue to move through now a you we were moving revenue to consignment last it a different type of action but the result to revenue is essentially the same from a yearonyear comparing a sequential compare those effect aren’t significant Theyre there but it not significant but those number are there Theyre baked into the number if you doesnt change in demand of course moving inventory from one bucket into onto our balance sheet Got it to of put a pin in it If let happens to be seasonal then it mean your revenue grow in a seasonal way or they grow somewhat le than still accommodating the lower distribution another way to it is yes if we were not making this transition our revenue would be higher If we were let’s we’re transitioning make up a number of in it would be higher Got it is where is in term of your millimeter plan given all the macro headband we have this and some of the market share difference we saw in the embedded altered how you about the rollout of additional millimeter capacity simple answer is our plan have unchanged Those investment are longer capacity investment a we had talked about even a we made the site selection and began to break ground at the site to put up the parking garage which is now complete the old parking lot been torn up and theyve begun to dig the foundation of the building and process started those plan remain unchanged a great a other thing slow down too to be able to do construction a you a manager a program manager in development for a number of year you always a a program manager three big variable always managing that’s price and scope and cost scope in schedule and certainly we have were not under the gun from a schedule standpoint we can optimize the other two thing roughly well plan to finish up somewhere around the end of or so the to month from now something Got it it wouldnt be a call unless mention the magic word around cash flow per share and cash flow per share growth be give u a for how you are thinking about a dividend growth had a very solid record of among the best in the industry not in semi but imagine in the SP a well how are you thinking about dividend growth and of modulating buyback given the pressure potential pressure on cash flow this you set it up very well for me to answer a we act owner and owner we allocate capital mentioned earlier our investment in thing RD are remaining steady in this because those investment are on three and five horizon a we to grow cash flow per share three and five year from now we want to have revenue growth so those investment are staying steady the SGA front most of the SGA go to thing thatll strengthen our competitive advantage whether that’s in the transition to consignment or distribution strategy or investment in TIcom or virtual selling we want to keep those thing steady and well be prudent and cut back where we can in more difficult time this but the other area we want to continue those investment CapEx we already talked about again our infrastructure investment to support growth longer we want to have all those thing still continuing and serve u well with longer growth the cash we have left over the commitment and plus or even longer track record now of returning all of to our owner the priority is dividend and well back and well at what cash flow growth make a decision of what to grow dividend with and the priority there number one is sustainability we certainly our dividend last around have to check the math it somewhere between to of our month cash flow certainly very sustainable so the priority the one is we want to have a dividend continue to grow even if cash flow is flat or down a bit wed still to grow it what the objective is then the balance of the cash flow we return with buyback basically how we of it and hasnt changed very good we are at the end of our you so much for spending a bit of your afternoon with u appreciate your taking the and you to the audience a well for joining u If you have any followup please always feel to call or write to me but well close the session there you so much again you Take care Bye Bye',\n",
       "       'in this format to focus on the near a much though given whats on out there can avoid it this maybe before we dive into more generally been at this a long many cycle in your career least in my experience this is my pandemicdriven cycle overall maybe could you a bit about what you is the same versus different from what were seeing now versus of a normal cycle maybe a bit about some of the structural change made over the year to you weather whatever is in store for u we talked on the earnings call back in in many way the best is to use the financial crash in to model or to about thing a were working through not a statement this is to be the same because it my pandemic a it is yours and many others it at least a reasonable analogy of a significant disruption we tried to be very clear is the same ambition operated for year are to drive our decision to act owner intend to own the for the longterm to make we can adapt and succeed in any environment changing then finally and a importantly were to make we can be a proud to be part of and one youd be proud to have a a neighbor so give those of higherlevel ambition because exactly how were looking at thing right now These are downturn or event to respect them there are also time where if you make wise investment if you spend your money in a smart way we described even back on the earnings call great ground can be gained certainly where were focused right now Got it to be clear on the financial crisis a a model were using it a well Although guess what hearing you is using it because it sort of the best we have there no guarantee it the right model to use but were using it of the view at this point accurate even on the earnings call is were not trying to forecast the precise shape not to participate in the letter of the week or the shape of the swoosh or whatever people are to try to decide What looked at though is you can back in and you could make some smart decision both in term of how you operate the from a plant loading and an inventory perspective you can also make some smart decision for how you invest money both for RD or for SGA or a importantly the next leg of investment for capacity expansion on millimeter Got it Lets about a bit mean the current millimeter strategy from my memory it announced in of so of on the tailend of the financial crisis obviously decision presumably made in the middle of the financial crisis paid enormous dividend sort of through and beyond the current pandemic do you expect your current priority to shift at all especially a it relates to increasing level or differentiation of investment or a it relates to cutting cost Like how do you about what were seeing now might drive of future decision along those line broadly in term of investment and again we mentioned this on the call RD is essentially to be unchanged because those are and horizon decision SGA to the degree were investing for new capability you mentioned in the brief overview of bringing more customer direct or change to our distribution program or investment in ticom these arent a good to make those investment these are actually a wonderful to where you can accelerate and get ahead of people in term of Where you can save incremental cost on SGA well certainly do then when it come to capital expenditure to be mostly unchanged because most of what were spending is looking out at a timeframe for what trend line of demand is to be which is why were moving with the Renner or the RFAB project to make shell be done and it be in timeframe Got it you guess in the nearterm talked about again hate to ask so tactically but mean getting question on online a well talked about sort of order trend weakening in late and through now Are you seeing any change in relative to what we saw in versus your expectation when you had earnings sign of green shoot from here again this is a coming in from the investor a well nearterm question are certainly understandable were to for stick with what we talked about in then when in when we get earnings out well give an update of how thing have shaped through the Got it to ask you about your inventory and fab loading strategy remember what happened in the financial crisis Like many others mean you have of tightened in in when thing fell off a cliff you did of get caught by surprise by the demand snapback recall your lead time went out to something week impression always part of what drove the millimeter decision anyways you never wanted to happen again this around you made the decision to continue running the factory mostly normally building inventory can about the broader inventory strategy in a moment in the wake of this you seem to be of looking at the view if there is a demand snapback you would much rather be positioned to satisfy and live with the risk if wrong do you about guess the potential downside if wrong versus the potential upside if correct in term of building inventory and running the factory where they are do you parse those decision a making a trying to decide what to do in the wake of the current environment generalize two thing commented on at least part of this is it our portfolio very differently from what we were facing back in is much different in term of the percent of our portfolio are catalog part they sell across multiple customer the confidence of the shelf life being very good on those is high it end up giving you an amazingly asymmetric bet where the upside is huge and the downside is minimal it not often in life you get those so you certainly you want to take them when they present themselves the other is even listen in the shortterm and you pay far closer attention to all the different semiconductor company through the earnings call but we were very well served with the inventory position we consciously have built up in addition to a great continuity plan and a great geographically diverse manufacturing footprint to where we worked our way through of in a seamless way compared to what a painful for a bunch of our competitor so this treatment of inventory bad is crazy fact if confidence in it longterm life in a when customer are not to be able to forecast what they need the can basically reach out to customer and do not worry the day you need something well have it for you to be served very well during frame whatever the shape of the recovery want to a we go through it we put a lot of thought into a lot of detailed effort behind it it serving u extraordinarily well now we it to serve u well through the next of year a this economy try to figure out what it want to do it guess to your credit the is in a good place right now where you have to worry about obsolescence of inventory wouldnt everybody is in same position So… is no doubt one compared to competitor but two and even at where we were back in and you couldnt take we were what exposed to the baseband and the handset with essentially custom part is a very different game to play than the one were in Got it you comment more broadly on the overall inventory strategy this is a before this not been something done in response to COVID been deliberately taking up your inventory over the last several year been staging it closer to your customer over the last several year been staging it closer to your customer over the last several year and building out more stockpile and everything else how all of fit into where are you comfortable running you can sort of review where your current target are for inventory and where those could even go on mean not even necessarily convinced those couldnt go higher over would before go into the day of inventory number is go back to even some of your introductory comment about been moving in a direction to build closer direct relationship with our customer because we believe over the longterm is to give u great advantage and allow u to win more because well be closer to them well what they need and we can better service it and support it so you watched it over a number of year a moved in direction a at this we were talking about this of next phase of consignment Then back in the fall of we announced we were narrowing down significantly the distribution channel These are all step in direction it getting inventory actually in one place because it actually give u even far more capability to be able to then aim at where the shortterm demand is on front even though the day have been trending up if you actually at the absolute dollar amount of inventory it actually remaining amazingly stable you cant necessarily see the number about to describe but we also at it when we through the channel meaning not balance sheet but what been held on the balance sheet of our distributor and been trying to bring number we have been bringing number down we mentioned on the earnings call been decreasing it for seven quarter in a row or something it all about how we get inventory in one place provide great service and support to our customer were to be highly rewarded for over Where lend itself to a day of inventory metric some background work were doing on right now historical day of inventory metric find rather uninteresting maybe even dangerous because it tends to be a day it may tell you to do the wrong thing at the wrong obviously based on what we described we were to do in the were not metric drive u to do thing arent wise Got it want to dig into the distribution strategy a bit Again this is something get a lot of question on client wonder what impact you pulled away from some of your distribution partner People wonder what impact might have at the same if you sort of at it a far a been along this path for a while been moving customer more direct been taking away the demand generation function from the disties maybe if you could a bit about the overall evolution of the distribution strategy over the last several year how are you Ive always been surprised actually able to actually handle demand generation function on your own Typically a big reason why the distributor in theory exist and you seem to be able to do very well a bit if you could on the general evolution of the distribution strategy consignment everything else and and what impact on how you run the the best way it how of it it how we have architected it is go back to the discussion here from and a lot about our four competitive or four sustainable competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology then a broad set of and embedded product then the broadest reach of our sale and marketing channel and then diversity and longevity we we believe this discussion on competitive advantage a slide for and to share during capital management but it is what we believe is how you fundamentally invest to build a very sustainable model for the long which is what let you do the thing you described in the opening your opening speech in many way the distribution change are part of about investing in a strength or leveraging a strength we invested over a building out application and sale footprint building out the capability of ticom now we continue to not only build out capability but now we want to leverage it a well the fact is distributor have never been very good at creating demand we proved very clearly because we round down theoretical involvement by distributor year not only did our share not go down it continued to go up it come back to it prof our view of where were heading is the right one these final change of now pulling order fulfilment out of the channel it something we can do much more efficiently because we can have the inventory in one place we can ship and fulfil it quickly it to give u advantage actually believe these are advantage and you our competitor well These are advantage are very difficult for our competitor to replicate because they have the reach of the sale channel the breadth of the product capability the ability to call on literally deep customer base in the mass market what is fascinating it exciting to me it to continue to roll out quite nicely Got it helpful If sort of how of roll out into the model mean historically if you at especially for a long a you were exiting some fairly sizable noncore business top line didnt grow much is done margin obviously went up a ton it feel to me and please correct me if wrong growth need to be more of a focus now given where the margin structure is can at some of the sign would suggest uptick in RD the inventory staging talking about Has focus on growth changed at all Does the growth actually need to be more of an imperative maybe than it in the given where the margin have over the last several year and forget done some of this math answer is this funny yes but no not trying to be cute with What mean is if you actually at the longterm growth of the and Embedded been watching it consistently growing and in fact gaining share over the pick it year so when people is growth more important well growth always been important back to this top view of we want to act owner are to own the for decade emphasized internally our focus is on building a stronger not necessarily bigger if you build the stronger and you aim it at the right market size is a result not an objective unto itself Now the reason gave a slightly cute answer if you at the math certainly over the next year not to get the same cash flow margin lift you over the half so to degree a now and embedded at plus percent of the revenue it to grow and certainly to be the prime driver of longterm cash flow per share Got it Got it Lets about those business in particular get a lot of question quite often on the difference between the and the embedded business both in term of margin structure and scale also some of the more recent headwind have impacted the embedded processing because the growth hasnt been there there some reason for we can about if you can maybe a bit about how you view the difference or not between those two business in term of margin profile and growth maybe touch on some of the nearterm headwind in embedded the audience find helpful there a of thing of you hear from and you hear from very often when they get asked whats the difference between and embedded To me it very different very simple they are different and we sit around trying to figure out how to get the embedded to the margin structure goal for is to simply grow and add value over and so were not trying to push margin structure to be identical on front we over the longterm it been for the or year embedded it certainly be able to do had great growth in the pick a frame of and started seeing slowing of growth because it had quite a bit of dependency in a of area during the end of and into Ive been extraordinarily direct with investor our job is to get back on a longterm growth track and we were certainly to be able to do so why great confidence it to add a lot of value to the and it a we want to have a part of our portfolio for the longterm been doing amazingly well and consistently well it even been growing quite well compared to our competitor even during the of year a been working through the consignment and now the distribution transition where clearly to have some temporary headwind on the revenue but the team actually been performing at or a better than market which is positive for what the indicator are for the longerterm guess to followup on mean been a consistent share gainer although you typically about it a something half a point a or so maybe guess given these change do you there any reason to expect could potentially accelerate or do you still the right trajectory given the product cycle are the length of the product cycle are in this market it to me it one of these thing if all we do over the next year is gain at rate to be happy a owner doesnt imply our objective are stronger than but you to be very careful of overstating or having bragging contest about the future a opposed to history speak for itself the other embedded of it and to me it a great aspect of the is a hard a it is to gain share say something about the structure of the market and the moat to use of defensibility which mean it difficult for competitor to take it away a well to me also a good statement for the robustness of the model over the long Got it guess again to build on some of around the end market obviously you have focused on industrial and auto you were one of the to clearly articulate strategy although it is a widely adopted strategy at this point for many company you review for u again how you about the attractiveness of those market versus where you were year whether it content or sustainability or barrier to entry or the long life and terminal value of those portfolio Like what can you review for u the rationale to be doubling down your effort there you it in the you it well Ive watched this industry for a long enough of over period end market or select end market tend to become the most important one driving the semiconductor industry you can go back to mainframe giving away to many computer giving away to personal computer giving away to personal electronics believe when you sit back and over the next at least and year the trend on content or semiconductor content growth meaning dollar per system and what those dollar per system are to do in the automotive application and the broad set of end market are captured under industrial they are to be the most important semiconductor market driving growth doesnt mean personal electronics are away Theyre to be with u for a long Theyre to be large market to be involved in them to be successful in them you have to be well positioned in industrial and automotive to be in the right space over or year do believe we lined up ahead of the industry on by choice our breadth of our product portfolio If you then to our breadth of process technology and package technology and you at our road map of what were investing in they have the need and careabouts of the automotive and the industrial market in mind higher voltage and higher power isolation RF Those type of thing all matter in world been investing well for addition our customer reach investment already talked about you want to win in the industrial market you need to be able to cost effectively get to and customer were the only semiconductor poised to be able to do it to be great to have on our side Got it want to ask about one of the other market where your view been maybe different from others so comm infrastructure particular if sort of put company on a spectrum of how they view the potential of market you are for on one end of spectrum on maybe on the le enthusiastic side of it you maybe a bit about why and whats sort of driving your view of and maybe comm infrastructure worldwide do it a market where you are focusing le try and use careful word on this your characterization is accurate in term of what the perception is we the comm infrastructure market we the market is a wonderful market one we participate in certainly participate more with the because we thought a smart to do five and six year and it proven to be wide reason we get described a being at the weaker the lefthand side of the distribution is over and year it a potential for secular growth because capital spending by wireless operator is not to go up if their capital spending is not to go up semiconductor content is not to rise so to claim is to end up being a false promise we it an important market a great market team are very good at it passionately involved in the and we it we it a one of the thing we do not the growth story or the primary driver of growth over the longer Got it Got it you a bit about your RD strategy mean this is another sort of interesting controversy Sometimes people complain to me they spending enough which is not something typically hear People usually want to see company spending more money in your case come up sometimes do you make the decision on how much to spend and where to invest and what the criterion mean you tend to run the overall for cash flow growth or cash flow per share Is the primary metric into when making decision on where and how much to invest certainly an end outcome for the longterm the biggest we try to at you and have talked about this for year is there are other company spend more money a a percentage of revenue They spend more than u on an absolute certainly we could go use some competitive filter and defend spending more the most important when allocating capital is to have a team of people are good at getting those investment to the best opportunity so one of the great discipline we have of our product line and unit and SBE our strategic entity structure is leader are good at knowing what the project are people have thought about and then having the discipline to put the investment on the six best one a opposed to investing in everything even though we could go defend it or explain it discipline allowed u to invest le a a percentage of revenue yet were gaining market share compared to these competitor are spending a higher percentage discipline go to many of the thing and about on capital management live it and breathe it on a daily and it to continue to help u Got it you want to ask a bit about China given some of the geopolitical thing are popping up now of all around the Huawei restriction What did you see with the prior Huawei restriction much are you shipping to Huawei now versus what you were shipping two year what impact if any do you some of the new restriction on Huawei are to have for you have data am to guess it down in general but only because of some of the lumpiness of how thing looked a of year back on front general mentioned when we talked even a would far prefer to see both the leader in the and the leader in China figuring out how to grow the collective GDPs of the country it would do better thing not to have influence on decision approach we take internally is very simple and is the environment is the same for u a it is for all our competitor and now go do a better job taking care of the customer and meeting their need we try to keep thing simple Do you see any potential impact from the new Commerce Department restriction careful on because there been a recent new set depending on the set referencing theyre to have a big impact for what we do give a very careful answer on Theres always activity the government always what all those thing are obviously Got it from the folk on the line here also around China They want to how your share is trending in China some of it to do with potential blowback against supplier Theres also the dropping WPG a a distributor Did impact your China share at all general guess is were more than holding our own and carefully heard on every earnings call when he asked for the geographical breakdown of revenue He give the cautionary statement where revenue shift to a opposed to where it designed or necessarily consumed on front no even with the trade tension were holding up quite well relative to the distribution comment in general been working through a mentioned before the design win change and the order fulfillment change these distribution change are to have zero impact in term of what our customer position in the long the fact is were in a good place right now a our strategy in term of higher availability of product keeping our lead time short making the investment in inventory continuity plan BCP plan geographically diverse manufacturing have led u function well through the current environment which is to continue to help u independent of the distribution channel Got it you want to ask about the the new millimeter strategy been you were building a new factory if you maybe completed it but working on the parking structure What is the current line for when you might expect production out of fab Admittedly with COVID throwing a bit of monkey wrench into thing in the nearterm Once it here though you expect the cost saving potential of to be similar to the prior millimeter even though this to have a higher percentage of new tool rather than used tool Like how do we about the margin evolution potential of this a this start to ramping over the the parking garage is done now and what whats important on is where the new fab is to go with the old parking lot one had to get done before the other is done Theyll be moving theyll be breaking ground literally any week now in term of thing of getting new shell in place then the intention is to have done and ready to be occupied by the end of with your background you can appreciate this a well or better than any analyst the real beauty of having literally connected to our fab one is it allows u to expand with a very fine grain or small granularity Meaning if you start up a clean field site a you you might have to go tool athird of facility from a capital point of view and get a team of pick a number or people in place to be able to even operate anything the beauty about being next door to Renner is you can actually make very small incremental decision on capacity expansion and literally be layering equipment in and adding people a you need it with new facility it to serve u quite well in a world where who know what the rampup then lastly on the of fallthrough even though were assuming a higher percentage of the equipment is new the real beauty about millimeter is the wafer diameter not do you get it at on the dollar or paying a dollar for a dollar go do the math These wafer fabs are to operate plus year it make the is it nicer to be able to buy the stuff at on the dollar it the cost benefit are all about the wafer diameter were to be very happy with guess make If using it for year you could appreciate it getting five the bulk of it lifetime it to be depreciated anyways whether it new or whether it used certainly is when we about the fact on a millimeter wafer you basically can get a cost reduction on the same equivalent die would be built on a millimeter wafer also made this subtle comment but it not a small one put aside the advantage you get on any chip scale packaging which is a growing percentage of the certainly we get the benefit of see make want to ask a is a topic coming up a lot broadly with my client on ESG you a about your corporate responsibility strategy what are the material ESG issue What are the risk or opportunity identified in your Like how do you about ESG investing on a it relates to whats and if were different with this but it is the heart of how about it a a the is it go to the heart of some of my opening comment is we have a set of ambition is how run this literally for decade now mentioned them earlier Act an act an to own a place for decade be able to adapt and succeed in a world always changing and be a you can be proud to be part of and proud to have a a neighbor we have set of ambition and a set of value go along with it how we run the it not separate from how do we to the ESG people it how we run the is the real intent behind the ESG activity on a broader is making doing good thing when you execute well not only do your employee win not only do your community win not only do your customer and supplier win but your investor win a well if you at u over the long great consistency in can see it in the material we about internally a well a externally it serf u well Got it we have about one minute left to finish this up the way always do to give you your soapbox Especially maybe for investor who are not owner at this point why should they be should investor buy stock here Ill give you the same answer give you any other you give me the soapbox is because were to act owner and were to operate the place were to be owner for decade to if we do well potential investor find participating with u beneficial Got it wonderful everybody on the line want to you again we are doing live polling with our partner Procensus If you could at least click on the link on the left side the Procensus link youll see a new window open up with a very short poll take you about second and youll benefit from realtime tracking of investor sentiment on were to close today session sorry about you so much for being with u appreciate it you and your insight Appreciate everybody participating and everybody stay safe too too take care',\n",
       "       'take our from of for taking my my one understand visibility is low and understand the way you are predicting a few week into have your order or booking played out the same way a it did during the financial crisis Does your consignment program now provide you better visibility than last am what you have actually so far in the so we can get a better handle on the outlook you giving me start and you want to chime in on a we have in the remark in fact behaved very differently than in the comparison not only but strong coming out of Chinese New Year we in the remark we came out a slowly but then thing strengthened and into the thing have abated in the half of we is due to the concern many customer have on supply disruption our and particularly the midpoint of our implies an expectation demand drop a customer internalize better their end demand and frankly they are to have very low visibility expect them to have very low visibly of demand why the important point here is we are keeping high optionality throughout this process so if thing snapback we can support can support on the other side of this well Do you have a followon to you mentioned you are continuing to run your factory loading in at the same a am if you can give u some color around what your modeling day of inventory to be exiting Is there a certain maximum limit to the amount of inventory or in term of day or dollar you willing to build before you have to start taking action for so a you framed them am glad you framed it way it is a capital allocation decision we are allocating capital in the form of inventory Capital is to go into inventory instead of to other place and the inventory increase we expect very likely to increase into what give u the optionality mentioned having inventory on hand key to remember and you it very well the majority of our product are longlived They are highly diverse They sell to many many customer They live a long on the shelf and the customer product lifecycle are very long inventory not go back it an option have a fairly lowcost upfront to have option great you go to the next please up we hear from for taking my the one if go back to the decline a lot quicker if peak to trough revenue fell about cycle been longer but if take maybe the peak to your guide in you would be down about suggests maybe there is still a more to go for following the same of trajectory guess also if the decline from peak to trough is longer suggest you might be thinking about the increase off the peak also being longer Like how do we compare the two situation take this is the recollection of would be careful of too much precision in where you are trying to draw to do valid comparison and you this very well from the history is a reasonably and half of were reasonably hot semiconductor market not overheated but hot clearly and the we are cooler compared to the heat of and when you try to get peak to trough a more complex tried to basically through what did we demand doing for a of year prior and what helped inform and help set where we put the operating plan Got it my followup you generally have ton of visibility into what true end demand is doing do you any way to gauge given the amount of pull we might be seeing right now whether it gauging the pace of rush order or anything Is there anything you can give u to try to gauge how much of the strong near demand might be pull versus anything else a you would imagine we have any precision on a we saw after Chinese New Year is we saw strength believe due to the customer concern hard to have any precision around what percentage of due to concern with any degree of accuracy yes you want to add to agree only would add is we is the channel is clean the district channel because a we we are four week we drained about on the channel and we plan to continue draining for the next three quarter or so about another or so plain drain a we convert more and more customer to go in direct the channel we is clean and continue to be clean a alluded to we the end customer when they pull how much of is true end demand versus stocking up for potential disruption might add too a you of our revenue is on consignment we are not turning backlog but we see plan are in our customer factory a they have reduced visibility all those plan are not updated they are being updated slowly a they are deciding what to build in those factory those updated plan are rolling through and whats creating the uncertainty a you would imagine you we go to the next please up from is you appreciate the color on the OpEx side of thing additional thought around of variable compensation a revenue come some mitigation in term of EPS impact over the next of quarter a we in the remark in general OpEx be relatively unchanged RD those are long investment SGA we also have some investment area there with ticom other place we frankly run the tightly to begin with but wherever we can tighten them more we do your on variable compensation tends to be a profitsharing and bonus Profit sharing move according to a formula so it very formulaic depending on what happens adjusts bonus is determined by the depending on routing performance on one to three year on several metric have a followon do understanding the different cadence by geography in term of China weak then came back and Europe and North maybe weaker now would love to get your thought for how you are expecting of thing within your guidance from a geographic perspective always give caution when asked about geographical revenue Sometimes we can see distinct pattern but where we ship our product is rarely where it actually consumed a you we ship a product end up in a phone built in China it may end up but in Europe if there something distinct in our guidance impacted by geography we would share we have anything to share with right now you we go to the next please next is for all these additional detail especially with on the line one for your comment earlier you you wanted to use a a template and is about a fair a template a could imagine a well also laid out about how the pattern a steep fall then a steep rise back you are behaving your action are very different this where you are keeping utilization flat et cetera is because you view this cycle a being any different short duration matching the same one a a decade is it simply the optionality side of the equation at the end of the day you are trying to maintain me have to help on covered this in some way If you back to and you and a bunch of folk we were very much different had a large wireless had portfolio reprofiling we had to do have had a high percentage of our product wasnt exactly custom but it behaved a lot custom building inventory a much more difficult game the beauty about where we are is a pointed out is a high percentage of the portfolio is longlived product have our RD and our resource well deployed in the area we want to be long what put u in the wonderful position where the cost to have maximum optionality is actually low on our particular case in versus where it back in you for guess a my followup switching over to the cash return side of the equation look you had much the biggest buyback in a single you have had in a decade you u on how you are thinking about the ability to return cash your long policy of returning of your cash flow and it not dictated by any single appreciate a well this significantly above what you generated in a single and maybe even in a of quarter of cash flow about how much leverage you are willing to put on the balance sheet to take advantage opportunistically of a pullback in your stock when it below what guess you view to be your intrinsic value me you alluded to it but me everybody on the call our objective when it come to cash return is to return all cash flow to the owner of the do through buyback and dividend for example on a we generated of cash and we returned obviously all cash flow there have been returned then you mentioned debt and we have debt on their balance sheet a we on the call we finished a net it is because we have of cash on the balance sheet we use debt to increase the rate of return with some leverage when it make how we view the return and the debt for many many year a we have talked about on capital management you go to the next please up is afternoon for me ask a want to go back to your comment in your remark about booking swelling a we have been coming to the end of Was there any end market distinction you can about am particularly interested in of understanding how auto and industrial is behaving at the beginning this pandemic versus maybe thing data center and comms would when we looked at the last it very distinct but we saw strength saw strength in PCs saw strength in data center saw a distinct slowing in auto a we a we talked about would the relative strength in order we saw in the happened in and continued into broadbased generally and across the board with the exception of auto then the slowing would it is also broadbased have a followon a my followon returning to about capital allocation and return since you are on the call you have always been good at sort of zagging what everybody else is zigging and you have a longer duration out there am of about how you are viewing the current environment relative to MA is sort of an arrow in your strategic quiver a we go through the next of quarter much clear then when you were in recession if you about it and you can even you have watched u for a long can go back to and then at what we did through and such clearly if you about capital allocation the thing stepped through keeping on the right RD investment keeping out the right capital expenditure making the right capability investment on thing ticom where you get very excited about be getting stronger during this and those strength help u even a the secular trend of more semiconductor in your life are growing To the degree we have an opportunity to buy used equipment or used factory or potentially MA a with anything on capital allocation one go down to the it depends type comment meaning it would have to be a more prolonged downturn If you about what the mood in and mood had to be there for a while before opportunity became we are certainly we try to be wise over the long you go to the next please we go to for making the cameo do you or do you anticipate any longer structural change in the either in term of end market or anything you are looking at a a result of this pandemic it early your world try to get ahead on trying to guess what happen in general the secular trend we have with semiconductor and more semiconductor coming into people life are to continue somewhat a alluded to in his it obvious in the near but server sale and PCs are to do well a working from home continues longer you at industrial product industrial equipment and even automotive even though on the near people see SAAR number down secular trend on semiconductor growth of automotive is to make it a great market to be in for the long no from point there be a big structural change do we have a great advantage of having structural channel advantage the change we have been working towards for a number of year of building closer direct relationship with customer thing you now see playing out with a higher and higher percentage of inventory being in our hand to where we can be more efficient to be a fantastic trend and is well to take advantage of with our breadth of channel reach through the industry can followup Go for it then to the extent you can if you could give u any insight into what the customer conversation are What are they asking What are their big concern guess at the root of it you talked about and thought about this why arent we seeing this sort of fall off in order yet Has everybody of frozen in place out there is happening if you and thought very direct with what he described a we saw order rise starting to peak at week of saw them rise up have them start trend down They are still at we saw approximately ending and in early starting to filter through u especially have the number where we are consignment take a while for those consignment feed to get updated because company have to start getting better number on front customer are still processing through what their customer are telling them and we see play through why we have made the assumption would be down from the and down versus a well for the you go to the next please up is you appreciate the wide of the guidance in this environment can you maybe elaborate a bit on what the assumption are sort of at the low end and at the high end of the give you my take Frankly there is no science on we talked about earlier we are using a the model for Again it doesnt imply precision not even similarity it the most recent exogenous event we can use we are using the midpoint is the closest to adjusted for seasonality What you normally would see on our transition now you are seeing a negative at midpoint the entire and the other reason we widened or the reason we widened the is to reflect the great of uncertainty we have on mentioned many customer right now they are still processing whats happening and we have actually heard some of them havent been able to update their feed to u right they have to go through all process so embedded in wide biggest point want to make and we made it a of time already is the optionality we are to get based on how we are running the factory right this can go multiple way for and and beyond we have great optionality the way we are running the both strategically the type of part we build and the end product and so forth tactically the way we are running the factory and inventory in Do you have a followon you other go back to what you mentioned there am your customer are thinking about this too and maybe they are perhaps building some inventory too to be able to respond to an eventual demand If should be the case how long would you be willing to have this optionality or perhaps run the inventory a bit longer than normal it to depend on a number of factor we right we and the world and the industry learn over the coming week and month and then we adjust an unnecessary the advantage we have with the way we are set up strategically with the type of part we build and the type of customer we have and the type of end market is we can afford to have this optionality right These part are not to go bad is very different in a custom part centric world in personal electronics type of centric world not the case with the way we structured in the we have great optionality to go through this beyond you go to the next please next from is you good to hear your voice am nobody wanted to hear you at this of a forum had a back on capital allocation and back to the template or playbook raised the dividend in the back then it a small person but it on a percentage meaningful a we compare where we are heading now versus am nobody had any idea what next to be whats the right way to about capital allocation Based on the comment you and and are making it sound no change in cash flow back divvy plus buyback no change to of help u understand the thinking or scenario you are playing out you are thinking through which might lead to a near modification on then have a followup set up and cover it answer is no change because we have tried to have a very thoughtful long plan it helpful for to summarize some of those plan to comment and a you and confirmed yes there is change in the way we of our capital management and our long objective a earlier cash return return all cash flow dividend specifically a you alluded to the objective is provide a sustainable and growing dividend to appeal to a broader set of owner a a reminder on a our dividend a of our cash flow now Of course a a backwardslooking metric understand it great place to start Frankly few company are at in our industry and in the SP it a great place to start objective of providing a sustainable and growing dividend it been and continues to be very important for u Followon did and this is more to do asked a good on structural change we are working from home at least those of u who can afford to work from home how is it impacting the design activity engages in in multiple geos multiple customer so many end market Whats the right way to about the change you are seeing there ode it portend poorly for when we ultimately get to a more normal world it why we included in my remark comment about how we are operating and it one of these deal produced an update for internal basically had a bunch of people telling me gosh we lucky on some thing explained there is this great quote luck is what happens when preparation meet opportunity we put in place this massmarket selling virtual selling technique starting three year an instituted standard process sale team work at application people work at comfortable with customer so it almost been nothing changed in term of where we spend our working between ourselves and the customer They all want to do it on the phone anyhow product group connecting in on the readiness we had to operate in this world is actually enormously high Having ticom more capable to support customer decision to be able to support online commerce a we are bringing more customer direct the comfort of our product group design engineer and people to work collaboratively because we have always had to do is very unchanged do people are working more hour because the day and hour tend to blend into one another a am everybody on this call is experiencing it very impressive to watch the team performing and watching what it getting done are even at point where all the set of customer visit even next week where those customer visit be virtual a well we are well into the way of operating this way want to comment on a slightly different topic but related in the spirit of preparation meeting opportunity want to highlight and we talked about it during the remark but we were for the unforeseen disruption with a combination of our inventory strategy our continuity program and our geographically diverse manufacturing footprint which of course is part of our one of our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology we have in all of those together we were able and continue to be able to provide our customer with short lead time and inventory availability in this when they need it most not now and the coming of quarter when their visibility be impaired would we have had customer actually contact u and they are rather surprised our lead time are stable and they can get the product they need they are very happy with you go to the next please next is afternoon for taking my and appreciate the additional commentary and being on the call you to about sort of geography fact of the matter is China is coming out of this pandemic and starting to open up their economy and throwing quite a bit of stimulus at it Are you seeing this being reflected in your order rate or consignment forecast for your domestic China customer roughly what percentage of your come from domestic China consumption start and please chime in if you would again give the number of product of where we actually ship the product but always offer the caution it where the box ship from we have of our product ship into China again you cellular phone a an example may be built there may be designed in California and end up in Europe a an example yes we are seeing those factory coming back online a we talked about in our remark Yet the uncertainty is how much demand actually be there a those factory back online whats creating uncertainty do you have followon you for IHS in it most recent forecast is calling for global vehicle production to drop almost this is twice the yearoveryear drop a experienced in the financial crisis Outside maybe the near inventory correction to of normalize to the lower production trend how is the team thinking about your content growth in auto to potentially partially offset significant decline in production this make a of comment and if you want to jump in afterwards feel to whats important for u is the longer opportunity in automotive remains unchanged we continue to invest in five different sector of automotive be more content per vehicle a you a you are pointing to respond tactically to those change in demand and we how to do and take care operationally not something we be able to control but we keep our investment steady and be to support growing opportunity a it arrives you have anything to add to would amplify a suggested earlier the secular growth theme are embedded in thing automotive or embedded in industrial are alive and well They are to be with u They are not to offset a SAAR drop in any one and you everybody when it come to making investment a very well you have to be looking five and six year out we automotive continue to be a great average upper of our long growth and outperformance you go to the next please up next is afternoon very much for taking the had one for hoping you could a bit about the competitive landscape you are seeing both in embedded processing a well a have been a consistent share gainer over the five year wanted to get your thought on share growth potential you are through this recession which all else equal would would be positive for industry leader yourself are also through the gotomarket strategy change have also the trade tension between the and China we about those three item if you can to your confidence around share growth over the next call it three to five year would be helpful you Toshi you have almost answered the you described a of secular tailwind if we do our job well where the secular headwind depending on trade tension but even there if we do our job well we can mitigate some of you also and am is smiling you to the right context which is you have to at this over two three and four year we everybody all the so you at the share we gained into and then the position we were coming out of downturn and we gained momentum in and certainly what our plan are right now is about both and embedded it about the market we focus on the customer the product the technology the capability ticom we put in place it where all our energy is on a weekly and daily to get better at you go to next please up is a lot have two guess the one is another sort of another how to about how those thing evolve guess move around indiscernible we are having trouble hearing you you start over please the is around how the cycle evolves and how to about it guess understand the magnitude the peak to trough magnitude is hard to back at and to sort of at it seems the near supply chain boost or the concern customer have about boosting near demand it seems for you effect is sort of beginning to wane maybe a earlier than others because of your consignment model frankly you are seeing it and wonder if you agree with it relates to the consignment model guess the is agree or argue you would maybe see it out the other side a well so so of all we havent what others have reported yet or what they have some it too early to do we have had theory of u seeing it early and seeing it late rather not weigh in on debate and report the fact we have and others debate it right do believe by pulling and controlling inventory we get much cleaner signal a we talked about before our customer right now they are not what their demand is to so what they are telling u hasnt been updated yet even what they are telling u isnt completely clear it to take a bit of before all stuff is updated you have a followon do yes guess on inventory if assume it sort of flat to up in dollar term obviously your day are to go way up in maybe they are or day and possibly they are up again in guess wondering can you give u some of what the pain point is where you might cut utilization Is it an inventory dollar Is it day is it sort of duration of recovery me step back and you for u the objective of inventory is to maintain high level of customer service minimize obsolescence while we improve manufacturing asset utilization target of to frankly is of incidental right a calculation the end of the day this is a capital allocation decision are to we have billionsome of inventory real money on the balance sheet if wasnt there it would be back in the owner bucket we are very thoughtful in how we are to how we make those decision to put potentially more inventory on balance sheet right le cash we have we it is to give u great optionality throughout this right you any decision when it come to capital management it to depend right the decision we are making now have to see how develop in the coming month and based on we adjust important the inventory last a long is inventory is scrap inventory is very very low the others well there a working capital and an opportunity cost to it but it is very low given is highly unlikely it is to be scrap it give u tremendous optionality on the other side to followup and this before so it me repeating his comment other to keep in mind and you spelled this out is well our inventory would be growing in drain yet again distribution inventory we have to keep these multiple variable in mind and it keep putting u in a better and better position when we are doing our balance sheet may show higher inventory but we love the fact channel inventory be getting leaner and leaner and the inventory be in one place where we can get the most effective use out of it go ahead and add when you and all the investor listening on the call when you compare u to most or maybe all of our competitor our balance sheet is very different in regard because we have many consignment arrangement twothirds of our revenue go through consignment whether it through distribution or directly with the end customer put upwards pressure on inventory we have also have our own manufacturing too including assembly test operation whereas to a very high degree about of our output go through our fabs and maybe or through our assembly test operation also very different than our competitor why it not applestoapples when you compare our inventory level to those of our competitor me make the point out though we owning and controlling inventory is a strategic asset we are very pleased we are having those consignment arrangement very pleased with owning our own manufacturing and what enabled u to do any but particularly in time of disruption what we experienced and continue to experience where it put u in a much better position to support our customer Right we have for one last we go to for taking my had one own fieldwork in the supply chain downstream from you indicate inventory are indeed normal if not lean level and a the virus spread around the world to place Malaysia and Philippines the shortage of component understanding your inventory are at the high end of the and not hearing anything about shortage basically supply is being disruptive and there is a reticence to give up any excess inventory downstream for you am wondering if you could describe what you are seeing on your own supplier base you want to run your factory at consistent level here Are you seeing any of these supply chain disruption your customer are seeing at other component Are you seeing how are you managing there is a risk you are not to be able to run your capacity consistently because of your own supply disruption all had Not a problem short answer to is we are not seeing anything worth mentioning on this call Little thing here and there nothing we can not manage Remember referred to our continuity program and we have been in this call we have been mainly about inventory finished good inventory we carry also applies on multiple other angle for example we also carry raw material inventory buffer have many dual and triple and quadruple sourcing of key raw material we also have a have talked about earlier geographically diverse manufacturing footprint in Malaysia in the Philippines in Taiwan in Mexico in China put u in a very good position also give u leverage to work with the supplier which by the way we pay them in day make a part of our thinking to be fair to those supplier and we play game on also from a long relationship standpoint we are in very good shape with all of those supplier Would you to wrap this up me wrap up by reiterating what we have previously History shown u it is time this when we can make the most strategic progress continue to invest in and strengthen our four competitive advantage which are manufacturing and technology portfolio breadth market reach and diverse and longlived product also continue to pursue the three ambition rich mentioned act owner who on the for decade adapt in a world ever changing we be a we are personally proud to be a part of and would be proud to have a a neighbor we are successful our employee customer community and owner all benefit is these ambition guide our decision in the week and month ahead a we navigate these uncertain time best to you and your family lady and gentleman today you all for your',\n",
       "       'take our from with on the solid result guess and relative to the guidance at the midpoint guiding down about which is in line with of historic seasonality for the typically off the bottom of the cycle you can get some above seasonal at the midpoint the yearoveryear is modestly getting better from to wondering what if there anything in the a to why it not a bit better than seasonal and specifically anything around distribution strategy might be a headwind in then have a followup Ill take and can add if hed so to answer the last part of there nothing in the sequential guidance would suggest there any headwind from distribution talked about before we would expect a we make the transition in distribution it similar from a revenue headwind a with consignment there be some there but already some of the headwind from the transition made in consignment the part is a were seeing those sign of stabilization we talked about history would suggest the growth is to reflect the end demand of the customer and therefore the macro economy a we go through the what be the driving force overall only other would add is a mentioned during the remark our comms equipment down yearonyear significantly a there a tough compare a is to have an even tougher compare on comms equipment may recall what on in on front Right Was growing significantly yearonyear do you have a followon then my is around the Embedded the MCU data is not necessarily the best proxy for when you of compare your result to data up until this most recent correction you were sort of consistently outgrowing the MCU data Embedded now gone through or quarter of of undergrowing wondering if you could help u through maybe potential share loss you talked about CPU specifically being weak within Embedded is to an end market comms how do we about putting in a good context a stated we believe share change need to be judged over long period of so if you at the revenue performance of Embedded over the last several year had significant outperformance a you pointed out in and Last we gave some of back point out in the most recent at the so and Embedded we saw those sign of stabilization but in every market so behaving similarly except communication equipment you take our next from of Trying to get to the trajectory and maybe the stabilization in turn you it broadbased on how you upsided the of last can you give u what the sequential change were by the end market you gave the yearoveryear specifically but if you could give for the would be helpful certainly these are all sequential compare Industrial declined midsingle digit Automotive about even Personal electronics declined high single digit Comms equipment declined about enterprise system grew in the low single digit Do you have a followon wanted to about the you talked about shutting down the two inch fabs told u about starting up the millimeter maybe a two parter if may you about the utilization plan in the how do we about CapEx you moving dirt and you have crane there but out of or cost you for the new millimeter fab how fold in in you asked a bunch of question there me try Ill answer the one remember me emphasize yes were closing two our two fabs still have some millimeter equipment theyre over year old and theyll be closed by a early a or a late a somewhere in frame have about of revenue run through those factory of course were moving most of revenue virtually all to millimeter saw a significant cost advantage a we have talked about over the year new factory so me about the new factory dirt moving crane are there plan are underway should have the building finished by the end of at point we can put equipment a needed to support demand a CapEx standpoint you want to model at of revenue finished with CapEx at of revenue and you should model at about same you next come from to put the hindsight a theory to the test here now of gone through this dip and recovery maybe about why you your sale and booking fell off so sharply in late summer then whats why are the customer a more guess a more optimistic right now then do you feel better about your now versus let call it six month over the summer Ill start off and if you want to add anything a we go through any cycle theyre all similar in a lot of way and different in others to put it in context youd have to go back to of Running up to we had quarter of yearonyear growth you never a through to have or or quarter of yearonyear growth but you expect at some point the industry would run below so a we started we thought we were what we were seeing mostly an inventory industry rather correction a were working through Certainly trade tension elongated cycle and part of the reason why we saw other leg down later last so and can you me the part or do we feel better about the strategically we felt we continue to stay focused on improving our four competitive advantage havent slowed down investment and we about our fabs underway If you at the OpEx investment we have made those have stayed steady focused on area of diversifying our growth in industrial and automotive we feel a good a we did about the cycle and go would add a mentioned strategically we are well positioned have been hasnt changed we continue to feel a good a ever on front then operationally we to be ready for whatever the market throw at u if this is to last longer to be ready for if thing are to head south but we also to be ready if thing turn around and then were to start seeing yearonyear growth and our model allows u to do and were well positioned for it Do you have a followon a longerterm on the Embedded Processing if you at the last of year it materially undergrown the overall and were still running it it about lower margin than the corporate average what are you thinking about What should we be thinking about sort of the longterm goal or aspiration for the Embedded in term of relative revenue growth or profit Do we expect it to improve or not improve if it not to improve is there anything you could do to change Ill give you a few comment on far a expectation you mentioned margin Frankly not Embedded is lower margin than but is a nonissue long a their Embedded contributes to cash flow growth the measure in stake the top line gone through some challenge here talked about earlier longer with their focus on auto and industrial in all of our business but includes Embedded we feel confident grow longer you take our next from of hoping to better understand what seeing in the comms appreciate the a high compare but the down a you noted how big Huawei a a percentage of decline in more importantly how are you thinking about the trajectory for this into then have a followup Huawei last to of our revenue unchanged from what it the prior if you at comms equipment overall if youll at the shape of the growth curve you had the of balanced with strong growth in the part and followed by very weak growth in the half the way it behaving is well it isnt a surprise to u we were through very strong growth we tried to everyone at the market is a market choppy it way primarily in early phase of technology deployment longer a talked about on our capital management presentation we believe be a growth driver for u or for the industry and based on the number of subscriber are out in the market and what the capital spending by operator be longer we growth in our industry be driven by industrial and automotive and hence why biased our investment into those area Do you have a followon great sort of related to it encouraging to see RD intensity or RD a a percentage of sale pick up in versus mean it had felt RD in decline for a number of year so it good to see pick up you u which product area technology end market you are focused on realize it to be industrial and automotive but if you can give a bit more color within those two end market would be helpful of course from an end market standpoint a you is industrial automotive where were focusing a product standpoint is Embedded and of course of there a bunch of piece Ill mention a few mean at the highest is in the case of is Signal Chain and Power Those are by far the biggest area and underneath there a bunch of thing Theres the within Power there all kind of power category and then within Signal Chain do you want to add something Ill when we of allocating capital to RD there three major bucket the largest bucket is go directly to product creation of new product release to new product a other two is of a shared centralized RD function develops our process technology packaging tool our engineer use SPICE model and those type of thing then the category is the Kilby Labs where longer higher risk investment are made new material new market and those type of thing where the RD been directed describe RD last a steady and stable even in a down market keeping those investment stable keeping focused on investing in our four competitive advantage is important overall you Toshi take our next from of Looks the yearoveryear decline have improved quite a bit in auto and industrial moving from down high single digit yearoveryear to down low single digit from to Of the subsegments within these two end market or by geography where do you see sign of improvement it broadbased it is the latter very broadbased which continues to be encouraging on front again given the diversity of our customer a well a the diversity the intentional diversity of our investment to have growth be broadbased it good to see the way the is performing Do you have a followup absolutely you mentioned look the team is now shipping to consumption guidance for this is for a seasonal decline given and are typically seasonally stronger quarter do you anticipate increasing factory loading here in the only about utilization and factory loading when there significant inflection point in this particular comparison to we expect a significant inflection point were not talking about it Of course wafer load utilization is always a function of what we expect for future growth well vary those based on order pattern and a we see demand in from customer you take our next from of of wanted to peel back the comment on stabilization Both these business industrials and auto and specifically industrials forget but there subsegments when you about stabilization assuming well you never had any channel inventory buildup channel inventory normal through the cycle and your lead time never extended out can you help u understand a bit whats the source of stabilization Is it it cant be the channel it the end customer but then you have thousand of end customer whats the right way to to get comfort you are seeing stabilization in specifically yes so it reflected in the stabilization is reflected in the order pattern the demand we see through consignment and actually the result themselves we went from where those market were declining high single digit some of them at to where all those market were declining at in those number it suggests there a bottoming process even though were holding in consignment program were holding inventory on our balance sheet certainly our customer have inventory of their product and then they have inventory are down their channel a the bullwhip effect would suggest you have a small change in end demand a move it way back magnifies we can see the result of beginning to abate Do you have a followon did cash flow margin you have powered through the you had given a of year you had in revenue down not getting the math right but somewhere in the high single and cash flow is down would it be fair to assume the target should be moved up when we hear you about capital allocation in a of week from now me take for the cue on we do have the capital management call coming on expect all of you to sign up for and join u there we about the various objective there Ill give you a preview not changing those objective and specifically one you talked about were not the reason for yes we finished a cash flow a a percent of revenue but the focus is not percent right way we maximize value for the owner of the is growing their cash flow per share for a long to we focus on and how we drive value you take our next from of of all coming back to the sort of recovery mean stabilization and eventual recovery Are you starting to see backlog further out now do you it of more in and of waiting for how macro unfolds throughout the Now for those arent a familiar with u Ill everyone or point out of our revenue are supported by consignment where we actually carry backlog but we do get demand forecast most of the at least six month of demand we can see and then there no inventory pointing out in his earlier call there no inventory between u and those manufacturing line for those customer actually the strongest signal we get when were looking at future demand certainly the backlog pay play a part of in general it consistent with the outlook we have our lead time havent changed it hasnt changed at all they have stable allows customer to have confidence they can get product when they need it do you have a followon apologize for ending on this topic but there a lot of concern about China insourcing including and Embedded Processing wondering what the company strategy is on topic mean is it is sort of life is normal do you actually have a longterm strategy a it relates to particular topic Ill start and if want to add anything certainly a we worked through the with the trade tension and a unfolded certainly heard discussion at Chinese customer them wanting to ensure theyve alternative in the end our customer are very pragmatic and theyre looking for component with the highest performance the lowest cost the most dependable delivery those are all area were very very strong competitively in Ill turn it over to to wrap thing up right me finish with a few comment on key item for you to remember remain focused on and Embedded the best product and industrial and automotive the best market we be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning cash flow to the owner of the lastly we believe growing cash flow per share over the long is what maximize value for the owner of the you for joining u tonight night concludes today you for your may now',\n",
       "       'to start it off mean obviously the entire industry gone through the cycle here always have the best you’ve been doing it a long have a very broad would ask you to of weigh in and you put the appropriate caveat you have talked about cyclical downturn and how long they last If you can maybe walk u through your current thought we are starting to see some company hey you it is all stable it overly enthusiastic but would people are getting a bit more encouraged were closer to a bottom and coming out of it those are my word to what you have on it have worked hard to stay out of the prediction game a you right not to change now you can put into context whats on right so it best to ground in the fact go back a in inclusively had quarter of yearonyear growth it longer than most cycle the in quite some we had all the major economy synchronously growing type growth with some when through you never if there’s to be quarter or or and how long upcycle last if you expect at some point it to roll over and youll have a where you be undershipping so a thing began to weaken in we thought from point following quarter we’d have primarily working our way through industry correction doesnt mean the trade tension and all others had a role to macro certainly a role in the semicycle if you remember in the a we saw some unusual activity in China caused we by trade tension with distributor stopping taking product about halfway through the of Of course they hadnt repeat unusual a we saw this last three of our market being industrial automotive and personal electronics decelerate in the you underneath those three market sector make up those market Most of those were declining it around the were declining in the core very very broadbased had enterprise which down about the same amount down about actually accelerating went from down to down so not still very weak then of course comms equipment it not to be unaffected by the macro and the overall semicycle there other thing technology deployment and thing drive it from storage standpoint of where we are when you at our guidance in it down doubledigits GDP is not collapsing doubledigits somewhere between indemand and what were shipping inventory to be being taken out we have a system tell u but it reasonable to so when growth resume be what the macro in Is it a world benign growth or is it growing is it decelerating all those thing impact the shape of when thing do return Still leading to the exit board I’ve been asking this repeatedly about trying to put you versus others and treat out the gap other one wanted to ask you you had some distribution change and did contribute to any of the belt and when you’re talking about inventory level and clearly you’re right the market gone down much Did those transition you initiated caused any of temporary headwind and a we came out with the guidance it a described is only for a of week until we had some of our other peer have a similar of guidance those question of where are the change we made in the channel impacting the simple answer is no in the book and we had the forecast set before we had the discussion we’re in the number from standpoint transition we had the discussion in the beginning of Since then been working on what transition plan our simple objective is to start a soon a possible and to finish it a soon a possible were talking about starting it in and ending in by the end of next work through those plan and communicate them when more information on it could we through transition have bump along the way next Certainly havent done this before having a closer more direct relationship with our customer we believe is the right place to go strategically is of the next click along a number of thing been working on talked about before over the year in strengthening one of our four competitive advantage and the thing deployment of our sale and apps team in ticom the consignment program and other thing it the right place to go could we have some bump along the way Certainly once you actually the entire vision of distribution channel and then you can pay several point for demand creation a get bigger you need claw it back and you end up paying very lowsingledigit percentage for some logistics in a hope may get Is the motivation here to of cut out some of those distributable or is it more consolidation to try to get more leverage or what’s the reasoning behind those reasoning and again they’re not of those four competitive advantage for those who are not a familiar technology and manufacturing millimeter is the best example of with of portfolio yield the reach of our channel and then diverse and long live position this one is about strengthening one competitive advantage which is the reach of our channel and the objective objective right again is to get more but having a closer more direct relationship with customer we believe allow u to do we’ve put in place some structure over the last six seven year lot of those step along the way were at a point now we more revenue to u directly if you of it more broadly the Internet isn’t is disrupting a lot of industry ours isnt untouched by it because of the investment we’ve made allows u to push it much faster and much further to our advantage one want to ask you is you had good growth and this is the of the number but it would mean you need a whole more inventory you strategically decided to of weather the storm a bit and raise your inventory range where are you at this point this downturn extended longer so you did start to custom utilization and but then if you go more direct you are to have more inventory requirement a well where are you in in term of what your internal inventory level and do we see changing and actually lower or higher from here increased the top end of our we of inventory at you’ve u operate above there is nothing sacrosanct about day or still something unusual about trying to keep product and lead time short so customer don’t have to worry about getting product Things the consignment program where we have taken inventory out of the channel or out of customer and have it sit down in our book now have twothirds of our revenue supported by pushed pressure up on inventory day but we again having fewer bucket of inventory pile in the channel and at customer and controlling and managing inventory is to allow u to have more stable lead time and better product availability that’s why were doing it again we’re unique we can be in a position to do where some of our smaller peer cant a you one of your differentiator is the millimeter strategy and give you hard for adding capacity and being way ahead of the curve and to value what you need did though for the of fab a new fab Richardson you pushed out two maybe about what is the millimeter capacity what’s utilization with the downturn if you can about capacity add plan you pushed out what would have provided on top for you we if you remember we announced in of this we had selected Richardson for the site of new fab at we expected to start construction in the next of year Nothing changed on actually in the last day began construction of the employee parking garage there is a of crane if you’d drag down the freeway you’d see construction moving on the site the step of construction fab is actually to go over the top of the current employee parking lot we get finished up sometime around the middle of next and we start construction on the fab itself no change on those plan have done sometime at the end of and then we equip it based on market need many time and he been quoting on would be two or three year early and have capacity in place in two or three month late of you at the asymmetric return you get by having capacity in place and not having our customer enough spending a lot of working through delivery shortage and those type of thing is important so we can work more on their next product and getting more of our product designed in actually if you at your result for this versus others one area that’s of embedded been extremely weak of put foot with a lot of others maybe you can about why been down so much this when you at and if you at year of history it not unusual and embedded would perform differently over shorter of certainly the magnitude of this difference in the length of is unusual it a bit to do with end market exposure more personal electronics of than embedded were headed up in automotive we are headed up in industrial part of it that’s not all of it so were working through when you at the performance near you need to at it over If you go back a year we were growing significantly faster than were growing faster than the market there is some normalization we on to a longer trend line a well of where we are I’d ask you we were sitting here last for you of typically is a bit of a wash because radio you’ve grown but you typically want to have some on the digital side Even have last only Is there any more headwind left or how much headwind do you have left on the digital side a been now deployed now you’ve taken some of the headwind away is now a tailwind to you wouldnt the what we’re seeing in the number and even saw it a we were growing yearonyear right so when we were growing we hey be careful this market is notoriously choppy and were seeing the other side of right whats driving it at the topline is of the servicing stop of deployment it’s trial in certain metro area and certain operator allow to get the equipment they get it installed get it debugged and then they’re ready for the next city those are the thing were seeing driving the number primarily To your point earlier if we have an incremental dollar of capital deployed were to push it towards industrial and automotive talked about it before of when you allocate capital you want to direct more dollar to where you believe the growth is to structurally be and where we believe the growth be Will help in the shortterm for comms equipment and especially in Absolutely Those are decision we made seven eight year to position u do we comms is to double in size auto industrial in the next few year our investment there reflect ask mean you made in you and actually Maxim at stage they of did the same where doubled down industrial and auto and mainly talking about those two end market saw the weakest right people went to more mobile and electronics did a bit better you of course went you went from to low of total revenue right If you mean effectively been a bit of a headwind so obviously industrial and auto did back and the reason higher margin of the real reason is there’s a secular content growth in there either own car are being driven around it very obvious there more content in car same dynamic is taking place in industrial harder to see because there sector and hundred if not thousand of end equipment where more content is to beat those market isnt to double it how it quickly it double you at a market personal electronics if you take handset and PCs and tablet and throw in the home assistance and portable speaker and thing our industry produce around of those a Theres a bit longer than a three replacement cycle drifting to five year people on the planet number cant structurally double or triple in the next five or year now were to have those thing in our life for decade to our investment there not zero but it different than when you allocate capital to growing market how we of it nearterm number are the nearterm dollar If you want to go back to the storyline in term of to see China tender maybe in and is to be the biggest driver the Huawei drama caused some disruption for people trying to sell into China term of it sound Huawei almost two platform some with content and some without Do you have any opportunity when you at the China market Huawei wont be all of allocation and can you frame the storyline next particularly within China what are your opportunity you can broaden beyond in communication and a good example of Huawei can grow the system that’s dependent on content there is a trade off they need to make when not using the best product are can make the system and the tradeoff are to be in size and power cost capability whatever it is if any customer in China it’s any customer around the world theyre always through a making those tradeoff to use something that’s more multisource or is the best product can use solves the problem the best way align or where tradeoff is made maybe vent more in China a they deal with the reality of the world not a world depending on where line sits doesn’t matter for u do well in either case want to ask you if you at and you have a very broad portfolio Some other company have elaborated more trend you can’t have it all you obviously are battling lower SAR and well see if equates to next can you framing the opportunity you see an auto next in term of what you are seeing growth opportunity five sector were investing in and in auto thing you are very familiar with ADAS infotainment body and lightning power train and then passive safety the four are other one have been driver of most significant growth for u investing in all five of those area and very intentionally trying to make those investment a broad a we can when you at of multiple dimension of diversity of auto for u one is customer base serve almost automotive OEMs when pulled the list a surprised it long Of course the rule is you the big player Bosch trying to have Denso Delphi are to make up percent of the revenue any one of those player have a of thousand different SKUs sell to them you at it from a product standpoint we talked about this before we product line at the and about of them ship product into automotive diversity serve u well it served u well in the it continue to serve u well in the future of thing me when were talking about those and wanted to ask you about China who know where the trade war go do feel personally theyre to be permanent change Even if there a deal the China is to want to do more domestically of your view of the world have you any area where theyve stepped up their investment you at your sale to China and you out five year do you a different profile it a great point right on is the world different than it two or three year for u absolutely is fact our go to China four or five time a and those date are set well in advance he actually went to the Monday following when the Huawei ban came up good timing he to meet with our team and our customer over there obviously tense if you remember back then midMay we have the coming up and the great hope we had we signed agreement completed of course date and gone Rich’s point back then it’s still true is if studied world history and a rising economic power challenging and existing power not something a trade agreement is to solve well have you tension for decade to get over emotionally get back to work and figure out how to succeed in of world of setting tone and it not a prediction to happen but it a mindset of quick wringing their hand and waiting for some magical event all the stuff is to go right what our team been after and that’s the mindset to have to succeed there Is there to refine point is there any area when you at connected MCU people traditionally see the area Huawei is to want these part and but then when you it more broader in term of your portfolio are there any area you would expect more Chinese competition Chinas ambition to establish a domestic semiconductor industry is not new been around for decade compete with competitor track about of them our four competitive advantage serve u well one is diversity and longevity if you can at from a product standpoint our number one product last about of revenue and it bounce around get down to a product and we’ve ten of thousand of product you get down the product and you are at revenue have hundred of customer buy those product right trying to pick those off they in such small chunk it never show up in one and doesn’t mean they cant make progress and they good engineer and good quality people the huge investment you cant invest and move into this market concur in a memory market or other part of semiconductor industry so we are ready for and we compete with and we have competed with it Perfect Always a pleasure for your you',\n",
       "       'the interest of why don’t we go ahead and get started my pleasure this morning to introduce who the and of a fireside chat conversation here for about the next minute a very informal setting is a mic being passed around the room so if you do have a be shy raise your hand and we get you a mic with you appreciate you coming out of the this and supporting our effort always find it helpful in sort of a fireside chat setting the be a bit openended to have you a bit about of the core IP but more importantly what your strategy is and of whats the investment thesis to the room a you quite well and followed it we tend to emphasize the boring part but not changing too much but hopefully it because were on the right path basically were in the best product and the best end market in the semiconductor best product for the and Embedded Processing chip and the best market are industrial and automotive it a very simple thesis on the best market and the semiconductor content of both the industrial market and the automotive market Semiconductor content be growing faster than those market a they make equipment smarter better lower energy use safer whatever factor to be a good place to be for the long a combination of those thing are where been aimed and we remain very focused on it and have talked about in the one of your core competence been recognizing when it a good to get out of market whether be memory or wireless it actually a you about shepherding your onerous capital it a important muscle to flex at Whats interesting is this is sort of the where you have any of the headwind had through restructuring ie if you had tremendous EPS growth over the last several year call it year but not much revenue growth a you were of divesting out of these business so a lot of u out here are trying to figure out how do we about the longterm revenue growth potential of the guess Ill throw back on you how do your market grow fast do they grow are you a share gainer so how do we about your growth relative to market growth Again talked in the on this you can pick your longterm semiconductor market number what you would pick or what you would advise bet it a mid single number depending on exposure to personal electronics or data center industrial automotive where you can comment where you are on general guess is mid single growth number from a revenue and a market point of view is a safe assumption with our industrial and with our automotive bias and bias should be growing you could argue maybe it a higher but it a safe assumption to make over the long If you at share yeah you over year we tend to be a to point share gainer a more some year le other year but been able to grind out we would always to do more but it if we can keep doing over a long of our owner are to be pleased with if can push the point on market share because the to point of been an historic sort of number in your core business you and have talked about in the whats unique about the is it still a highly fragmented in an overall semiconductor industry which continues to consolidate Ive joked with you in the the largest because there this other called other actually a bigger portion of the market all the trend around the data economy and the importance of scale and leveraged importance on the manufacturing side why wouldnt share gain accelerate to a higher than theyve historically been give you great credit for consistency of thesis and you can certainly make argument you my nature and the company nature were not to get out ahead on Are there thing you can get excited about when you about our core competitive advantage millimeter manufacturing and more help more you about breadth of product a strength get better with Reach of channel and some of the thing we can do uniquely in our marketplace versus our middlesized or smaller competitor if were using data and information and scale smartly then yes you can make thesis careful there a lot of focus on revenue growth in this world believe is always healthy so internally we do spend a lot of making the emphasis is get stronger aim at the right opportunity and bigger a a result Dont chase bigger because sometimes you can end up place you want to necessarily get to and done well in the or year mentioned in your opening comment you love boring which mean there hardly any controversy around and the controversy is too strong a word it a word we on the sell side to use so you read our call note if you at the guidance given in the you went a bit early and it a bit weaker than what investor thought and quite frankly a bit weaker than a lot of your peer one of the conspiracy theory out there you to address is been on sort of a to journey around distribution and your philosophy around distribution of trying to deemphasize the distribution network relative to being logistic fulfillers of demand and being more direct specifically the most recent the dissolving your relationship with Avnet some of the investment community have thought maybe adding to of the negative outlook or cautious outlook for Is there any truth to Simple answer is no Theres no truth to more important one is to have a more exciting earnings call cycle than he typically had the few year which is good keep him busy on front and at this and again put it under the boring context and usually and even it in this earnings season where we were it doesnt quite a different a the microchip and other company out true put aside Time is what matter result over matter on the distribution change been working on this for year Changes in how done it it not about deemphasizing distribution it about emphasizing u having direct relationship with our customer because we it put u into a better position to help them if we do better well win more long so watched u at a very steady fashion changing program consignment inventory some of the latest change with the global footprint and is all about building this relationship effort of what we do through ticom online transaction with the store remain a excited a Ive ever been of what future look Ive with all the change been through be it the sale and transition back in the with memory or defense or change with wireless back in the decade every is never smooth and linear everybody draw more attention to well is there something happening or this is where were longer and we were to build a stronger and a more valuable believe if we stay focused on good thing too relative to your philosophy around distribution of is this unique to because of your scale Ill draw an analogy back to when you decided to do millimeter manufacturing a lot of your peer downplayed it importance then aggressively went out and tried to find foundry partner they could do a manufacture with given the breadth of your customer base of plus customer why not depend more heavily on distribution to the extent you you can do better direct you a bit about why you feel way and maybe bring up of your web strategy within context of unique given scale and again followed the industry for a long and if you at the major distributor theyve actually become such broad line supplier Theres actually no preference when you get of if you want to make a difference to go build relationship directly a you noted with a great leading we are the one the scale to go do this across customer across the world from a sale force and application force made the investment in ticom made the investment in the technical collateral and the data and the analytics to do well put this again back on same list of competitive advantage millimeter breadth of the product line reach of the channel we try every day we get up to either invest to make those advantage stronger or to make were leveraging them in everything we do if we keep doing well the net result to me the ultimate test of those competitive advantage is are we growing our cash flow per share faster than our best competitor you go at the over the year been able to do and we continue to stay focused on well be able to go do for another decade out ahead you spend a bit more elaborating on the ticom strategy do it unique to your specifically how using to help drive incremental sort of opportunity set Simplest to start with is when you or anybody in this world are particularly if a design engineer graduating from college they start a design project where he or she go They call a salesperson Most engineer we talking to people Wed rather get online and solve it ourselves where are they to go Theyre to go to the web so we want to make ticom experience to where we are literally the easiest and the most efficient way for our design engineering customer to search for part select them design them in get to production and then never have any issue a tell people internally if all we do and we do it well were to be very successful so if you at what been investing in it all consistent with approach it make the product are easy to make great part all helpful make it easy to find make the best technical collateral and information so the investment continue we feel moved early on if we stay aggressive well be able to make it a real advantage long your breadth and your size the fact you operate so well a much a you hate this we in the investment community always lean upon you to tell u about your view on the cycle then whenever you about it we dissect it Fed speech to see what did they this versus day it changed in vein can you a bit about where you we are in the cycle Historically talked about sort of the observation it usually to quarter of down yearoveryear growth before thing start to reaccelerate given how uncertain the environment is and the fact yearoveryear growth rate are actually accelerating to the downside with your guide where are we in the cycle and how do you see playing out change what and have talked about what you summarized we hate talking about it we find it very relevant for our world because we spend our making we can handle any outcome of plan in but were also busy making we can handle any outcome of plan in so work under way down in north of Dallas getting ready on the next millimeter fab we need it this and we need it in but rather be a few year early than a few year late when it come to being able to grow out this one is from a semiconductor cycle meaning the inventory buildup and drain down it all happening much according to the way it usually or quarter can at history sometimes it try to be precise secondary actually is the broader one and it for everybody a investor is whats the broader global economy want to do in you can get the inventory down but then back to being dependent on what end consumption is to we’re not to try to make a great forecast were to make we can handle a of outcome and do well with Perhaps every cycle is the same except it different the biggest sort of known unknown at this around is China trade relation and whats on there you spend a lot of in Washington you spend a lot of with the Kind of give u sort of your assessment of where thing are in the near one guess more importantly because want to make it a Independent of what happens at the end of this journey it seems China is resolved to decrease their dependence on supplier is only to go up over in your there enough moat are deep enough and big enough it not something we a investor have to worry about do in the Embedded perhaps there opportunity for domestic substitution with either Chinese supplier andor nonUS supplier of you handicap of risk you have quite a bit in there me go with the simple is somewhat even the market environment the biggest Ive learned and we to people internally is we do not control the market control our performance relative to the market let u have full accountability control China trade relation it to be what it to be Ive told people internally assume it permanently changed now go win we get excuse get waiting for some deal to get struck to go make your product more appealing than anybody else in the world on front actually very pleased with focus because it usually drive great result the of longterm China growth of the China industry you and Ive talked about this Ive always had on the list of exogenous thing to be for Chinas ambition to build a domestic semiconductor industry is not new Go back to the and pull up one of the plan and at the investment have been made now for or decade trying to build so it isnt a new They certainly are to have yet another round of a fund trying to do thing If in the DRAM or flash it a not it a different problem than well face fortunately youd better respect it but it isnt to change thing overnight so there to be plenty of room to compete our Embedded the beauty about it is it not the put some memory on the side of a bit processor because there is people can do we have spent a lot of and investment to make it is made up of unique product with unique value if you go do we can be a successful in China a we can be anywhere else in the world on were to have more exposure on the Embedded side on the China front a discussed of the disadvantage of embracing boring it the wrong strategy is it leaf u the investment community of struggling with better understanding of the your comment multiple year when we were beginning this transition is it make u difficult to analyze Whats to me it actually better for your multiple not worse for your multiple a very wonderful problem in the Embedded side of the if we at the landscape there been a land grab for RF technology on the MA front guess can you help u position if we a spot and dot chart of all the IP you have within your Embedded and of at the competitor across the board where are you strongest Where are you weakest if you about of the buzzword Wall Street think about a the real driver of what would they be to be the IP dot chart and we grew up knowing it because when you played in the wireless market and these very experienced though theyre wonderful bragging contest at investor meeting but they always correlate to longterm result a witnessed by seeing more claim of success at a a great way to take inventory on the portfolio What care far more about is how good are the business of Embedded at solving customer problem so where lowpower microcontrollers do you do it well Where a controller a great job with embedded control or motor control or support for electric vehicle it do it well Do you solve the problem well our growing radar is to stand out a were ahead of a lot of people growing position in some of the ADAS and infotainment space with smart balanced lowpower processing is very unique those are the way we tend to about portfolio what we have to do and what we have to do well is rich could fill out the dot chart then a lot of other people are busy trying to fill it out how you use it together and how you use it together well make the difference Talking of MA Youre overdue on your minute in and we to MA because you havent been shy in the made relatively large bet have had relatively good return do you of view MA a a strategic a sort of a device is the MA environment to you fruitful not fruitful Put it into context it remains an important aspect of capital management capital allocation a with all thing around capital allocation it depends on what the return a you remember quite well now when we did National it no great roar of applause fact it the opposite we received but it a nobrainer when you decided boring is better it it a nobrainer and the cash flow on purchase price something percent how to turn a cash flow yield of purchase price into a great return on investment how to take one return on purchase price can turn it into but cant turn it into or over thought and were a perfect to buy stuff world petrified we well if everybody is petrified let go buy wafer fabs let go buy used equipment let go buy what we thought one of the best asset and it a great to do now with valuation where they are it is a great to be putting money into organic growth organic competency many of which talked about and grow Biggest tell investor is the day we start being interested in MA you are to be in a lousy mood because it mean thing arent great the perfect to be trying to for anythings changed to be patient Sticking on capital allocation priority a it should be is to invest in the two biggest investment driver are RD and CapEx talked about RD in the the majority of investor at your revenue to RD ratio and it too low one of the few actually argue it might go lower sit there and go not how we about the can you spend a few minute talking about how you go about defining the opportunity set for RD guess to my or to my thesis if more and more of the over migrates towards industrial and auto which are longer duration sort of product why isnt RD to be much more leverageable a a percent of revenue careful with the last part of statement because it implies then by how much it come back to and you hit the nail on the head people do not understand the power develop a successful part for industrial and automotive and it life for year me help you not investing in part running it for a long and those are tremendous return there not a static percent of revenue in the current model make to at where our product people spend all their is making were getting investment to the best opportunity believe scarcity or pressure of scarcity unit leader project were to get you enough RD to cover of them our people all people are good at getting the right fund at the top of the list you go find a invests in every idea they have Ill show you the one working on stuff they shouldnt be working on so pressure of scarcity is one of the great thing our leader are getting better at includes portfolio management If you’ve a group where the list of opportunity is better than somebody else then be getting resource move from one bucket to another never about because it done at a lower in the organization but that’s a very powerful way to strengthen thing we do not at it a a what percent of revenue if we there better and better opportunity well take the RD up other side of is CapEx this most recent correction in the semiconductor industry you were on path to start breaking ground for your next millimeter facility you a bit about the status of guess the concern in the investment community is you had once in a lifetime opportunity of building fab cheaply and benefited the model over multiple year fab by definition is to be more expensive because not to be able to buy equipment out of bankruptcy how do we about the impact of on the operating model a this fab ramp it two thing anybody drive up or down central expressway through Richardson there is two crane up in the sky to get the parking garage built the reason you to get the parking garage built is new fab is to go where the parking lot is to get one done before you can start the other were moving on well get on the building later in make we have being sometime late be in plenty of depending on what of assumption you make on the market If you watch our history we built our millimeter fab the shell built in didnt tool it until built the renter facility and we it stood up in didnt tool it until and it sound we tool these thing at the bottom of market it turn out by coincidence we did it a perfect ready for growth come out of it were to be in great shape Unused versus not used equipment millimeter is the magic what get you die cost reduction and make all the economics work Now if you can get discounted equipment on top of even more fun are we to get made the assumption because the amount of used equipment were assuming be lower if we find it we certainly buy it there is a used equipment market Theres always equipment dominoing out of some of these leadingedge memory or logic facility no longer need it and we can use it for or year when it all and done we guided assumed it a more on CapEx but still very reasonable number even with newer equipment payback be spectacular in the audience maybe can continue then If you across the semiconductor landscape and quite frankly the tech landscape a lot of ex TIers out there so it clear theyve been very successful in their career it clear there a lot of great internal talent at up from to about succession large part help u understand of how viewing succession Is it an internal candidate Do you have a strong bench a bench a lot in the investment community hasnt been introduced to if we can spend a few minute talking about it there a few very simple thing and is a great team and followed u for a bunch of year surprised people every year go by gosh bench look stronger people are well it cant be well and then it is and it because we one great people and they continue to get better working model we have on the you get a chance to meet the people run of the major business is it is a wonderful crosssection we have so the if do my job right theyve great candidate internal doesnt preclude external but make giving them great alternative it very simple let find somebody give u another strong run to make this play stronger how we of it well be successful doing it last hard to fault you on what done on cash return you started the trend everyone followed done a fantastic job Usually question begin go some there a but Theres always a but you talked about this If you at your balance sheet it look underlevered look you could borrow debt at a lower cost of capital than your dividend yield and you could buy back stock all day long why not do it to me it a degree of how far or how much if you back and you ask where is our leverage Where it even year or year taken advantage of an incrementally very favorable environment and you described it quite well forget if an average interest on debt is sitting in the forget the exact rate in term of where is and his team have been very thoughtful and very disciplined in term of how theyve done at the same believe this is one of these contest of setting up the MBA finance class who can maximize the leverage for any one to strengthening Balance sheet are thing to make they work well not only in an upmarket but who know what the future is let’s make is very very strong over the long somebody once balance sheet matter until theyre the only matter why risk for a bit of incremental leverage something along those line it a great strategic asset to keep u at strength we’ve ended our in this session want to everyone for joining u but especially want to for spending with me this morning Folks you you you',\n",
       "       'take our from of of go ahead for taking my one is on the outlook do we get confidence this isnt or share loss because when we looked at some of the data for and August it more positive is it anything is in because the guidance is substantially below understand the macro environment is not great is there anything oneoff is impacting your guidance Is there any share loss issue other color you could provide would be very helpful take would state the obvious obviously the number are more backwardlooking versus the looking into when you judge share and we have talked about this in but you need to judge it over multiple quarter at the diversity of our revenue about one of our competitive advantage being diversity and longevity biggest the product last a an example about of our total revenue diversity served u well and continue to serve u well Do you have a followon Somewhat more longer there is a lot of discussion of parallel technology in semi ecosystem developing in China a it try to get more selfsufficient well is placed from a competitive perspective Do you there are substitute for your of and embedded product from Chinese vendor over some intermediate timeframe what would need to do different a a to react to this new ecosystem start off if you at the and the embedded market they have many natural competitive moat sit around the marketplace overall we have certainly heard discussion of Chinese customer wanting to ensure they have alternative it very different than being designed out our customer overall are very pragmatic They are looking for component with the highest performance the lowest cost and the most dependable delivery we continue to focus on those thing they have served u well in the and we believe it continue to serve u well in the future you go to the next please next come from of go ahead for taking my guess wanted to followup on a bit around have been in this environment for a while you had your guide for cut actually on this call a even on call you had guided down about which obviously below are a later have had a number of round of cut the base is even lower and now you are guiding down by it even worse on a sequential than we saw in the when we started guess it and again it not thing have been weak all along guess if you can give u some of an indication maybe what could get immediately worse Is this your Huawei pullforward working off Is this something on because your distribution strategy is different from your competitor guess anything you can give u around the tactical near environment driving the guide would be helpful given what we have over the last or so in those trend for the me take a shot at then followup with other comment our is customer are far more cautious than they were certainly a but even day many of them when about the caution they mentioned the trade tension we have been happening and have been accumulating over the last three or four quarter the consistency of breadth of weakness support this is a macro situation is driving the further weakness we are seeing have a followon do you have about evolving your distribution strategy and relationship Do you it possible any of those activity a you disintermediate more of them maybe having a near negative impact on your revenue outlook because you can rely on them le to do thing demand generation and the Is there guess any change you have made recently you could be having any sort of impact on the near horizon Simply in a word would no establishing a more direct relationship with our customer yield more reward than it the risk it give u greater access to those customer you have u evolve over the last several year and we have made investment in order to provide very high level of service for our customer especially a we move to a more direct model these investment include the thing you have heard u about the new capability and in some case improved capability to our ecommerce enhancement for demand creation inventory consignment program we have talked about on the last the last few call and other thing order fulfillment service these improved capability combined with our sale and application organization which by the way is the largest in the semiconductor industry help u provide great product and great support to our customer what we have been focused on you we go to the next please next come from of go ahead for me ask question want to go back to the embedded at how your trending it about in line with our expectation and quite frankly what your peer group is doing when at embedded it seems to be demonstrably worse fact if is down equally across all segment you be down peak to trough this cycle in embedded more so than you were in the financial crisis when financial market werent working properly and company couldnt actually get funding for inventory want to of go back and of understand why you the embedded is doing so poorly relative to overall of industry trend Is where the comms weakness come in If you can help me understand a bit better it would be helpful to put it in context we talked about at the so including and embedded all the market were week when we saw the sector make up those market most of them were weak weakness more pronounced directionally the same but more pronounced in embedded you we did see and if you now of embedded we saw a more pronounced weakness in automotive and in communication again those type of thing need to be measured over longer period of so wouldnt judge on any one result overall have a followon a a followup back to the comms part of the am of not the macro is all strong but to what extent can you quantify if at all the impact from ban Is this way Huawei having ordered a lot more inventory throughout the than you thought Is this a certain or region on the comms side any color you can give on the weakness would be helpful we cant rule out obviously you customer having built inventory in preparation for build or concern with the trade tension the weakness we saw wasnt limited to any region very broadbased we at the largest customer of comms equipment across the largest customer again we talked about it across the technology it broadbased the weakness not one customer or not one technology or not one region hopefully color help you go to the next please next come from of go ahead you gave the yearoveryear comment and then the sequentials for the comm equipment we are all trying to solve the main problem of of why is your guidance so weak in the To the extent it provides any clue could you give u what the quarteroverquarter sequentials were by the end market outside of the comm which you already gave Industrial and automotive declined low single digit Personal electronics grew midteens and based on seasonal growth we would expect to see already commented on comms equipment declining about then enterprise system grew in the have a followon guess one on the cash return side of thing one doesnt necessarily make a trend but you have been ridiculously consistent in a positive way with your buyback over you raised the dividend this last the share repurchase the lowest since believe the of if my model is right the aggregate of the two the dividend and the buyback were meaningfully le than the cash flow in the it not one but is there anything at explains why the buyback significantly lower than it been in any in recent history would tell you and is take you back to our capital management strategy and our objective to return all cash flow to the owner of the a you pointed out we do through buyback and dividend on a which is a better way to at all these thing to give you a better trend of whats on we have returned of cash and our cash flow been during we have returned of cash during a healthy amount in the last we returned or we bought back long a the stock price is below our assessment of intrinsic we be buying back share and we did buy a healthy amount in add to a it quite best to at the cash flow metric on a a there is seasonality and tend to be stronger than and on usually provides a better insight you we go to the next please next come from of go ahead wonder if you could give u more color mean you have talked about your customer being more cautious to what degree do you demand being softer different inventory behavior guess on the flipside mean it doesnt seem you are seeing a lot of inventory accumulation around the tariff activity could you generally comment on the state of your customer inventory a you move to the last make a comment and if want to add something to it certainly jump in you when we at inventory in the channel it actually down a bit still at about fourandahalf week not changing much overall still have about twothirds of our revenue supported by consignment overall we inventory remains at zero because of those consignment program they continue to be in a healthy state rest of we cant see into our customer inventory and down channel our visibility end at point only would add can you collectively are unsatisfied with our answer and understand have close to different customer and we sell about different product difficult to pinpoint any one the we get talking to those customer getting input from them from our salesperson and all the touch point we have is the weakness is broadbased is due to macro event and specifically the trade tension if you about when there is tension in trade and obstacle to trade what do business do They become more cautious and they pull back we are at the very end of our long supply chain and when the one at the very front pullback it becomes a traffic jam our is is whats happening in the marketplace we see what other company report over and we get a clear picture over the next several week and quarter because this we have been in it for now four quarter and it to be longer than have a followon for the color do appreciate you clarifying whats on term of the wafer start reduction in the can you about guess normally you have talked about a incremental margin in both direction anything of different a you about because of the fact of wafer start comment you made no not any different to the larger degree have talked about to fall through a guide could be a le a more how you want to about it on a yearonyear for did lower wafer start in of the and we are lowering those further into a capital allocation decision we do we save cash right we have to a larger degree built the buffer strategy we have talked about we save cash a we do and make for the owner of the is cash freed up for other purpose hit the GPM line but it do so about a expected a you have a fall through we have talked about in the big scheme of thing you go to the next please next come from of go ahead OpEx is usually down low to mid single am trying to see if the right number for in the guidance OpEx well remember the objective of OpEx is to fuel our long growth and these are long investment pay off over many many year in many case decade how we about this environment we are cautious and we want to be prudent we are not cutting back on those long investment a OpEx been running steady at about for at least a or so if you at at the end of every for the last three or four quarter it is overall is down about versus a of course revenue been dropping more than then a a percent of revenue it gone up a bit now it at well within our expectation our guide of to for metric have a follow up guess with respect to the loading commentary it make you rethink the timing on the new millimeter fab if you can give u an update there me you of course when it come to CapEx particularly for fab it all about driving long revenue growth and extending our manufacturing advantage including millimeter is one of our key competitive advantage are now in the process of building a parking structure be complete in the half of next Once we build enable u to build the building for the next millimeter factory plan continues to be to build building within the next few year a a reminder cost to over a of year a we build building to it is a sizable amount the big expense come from the equipment would follow in fact an even bigger one be the opportunity cost of not having if there s or when there is growth on the other side of these thing we about all of those thing and based on we have laid our plan at the moment you can go to our next please next come from of go ahead afternoon for taking the guess wanted to revisit comment around China and the potential for pullins If back at your up about yearonyear where everything else down so guess a you back and you do you have a in fact pullins in the prior quarter and perhaps exacerbating what you are seeing into the so spent eight year of my career in sale and the job never once took a double order or saw a customer do a pullin right so certainly wouldnt rule out a a possibility more of what you are seeing there is seasonality a customer prepare more of the PE product our product are shipped into China than any other region an effect in there a well again wont rule it out you have some seasonality on with have a followon do talked broad based weakness hoping perhaps you could narrow in on auto and give a more color on what you are seeing there either geographically or by subsegment we have five sector are of the sector saw weakness made the comment if you at the sector across industrial and even personal electronics most of those sector were down automotive no different from front would from a regional standpoint we saw weakness across all of the region nothing significant there to spike out you with we have for one last last come from of go ahead you you maybe a bit about the linearity of the order obviously there been some weakening am wondering if you already started to see this summer it sort of something more came later in the would it weak throughout the wasnt last of week or last day phenomenon would also point out we have twothirds of our revenue on consignment in those arrangement we get the order and ship them instantaneously at the same revenue and order reflect each other for the most part Do you have followon had a followon for you have done a tremendous job on margin Revenues down yearoveryear but margin only down point now your inventory day were down a well you talked a bit about the factory loading in should we about some sort of a inventory day target you want to run the at next few quarter good me step back and you how we about inventory Inventory the objective there is to maintain high level of customer service minimize obsolescence and improve our asset utilization have a guide of to but those are not concrete barrier right a guide there are to do the right for the for example in this situation in the current environment even though we have decreased those wafer start it is likely we go above the top of or it at least possible we do because of where the revenue midpoint is Now we are not to go drive the wafer start in a draconian way to to stay within those guideline would not make in one over one two three quarter then the idea is to guideline provide an area where we should aim at and we can achieve our objective the inventory objective talked about while deploying and allocating capital in the best way benefit the interest of the long owner of the with me finish with a few comment on some key item for you to remember remain focused on and embedded the best product and industrial and automotive the best market we continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning cash flow to the owner of the Lastly we continue to believe growing cash flow per share over the long why we maximize value for the owner of the you all for joining u of this call is also on our concludes today call you for your may now',\n",
       "       'good morning everybody to the day of the Technology of the Semiconductor here in the we are fortunate to kick it off with the and of always if you have question raise your hand we’ll get a mic to you towards the end because there are people on the with you for kicking it off this morning the risk of you not commenting a bunch on it start the same way Ive started with a bunch of other company the macro environment and the trade environment clearly had an impact on the semiconductor industry a a whole with being the largest player in the world wanted to get a read from you on how you are viewing the macro situation versus at the beginning of the a inaudible we’re getting this morning no different than what you heard from and on the earnings call came off a strong ‘ and ’ you saw thing slow in a different part of ’ so a semiconductor classic semiconductor cycle working it way through in a orderly fashion and then put on top of the uncertainty due to trade and the good news is we are to make a forecast indiscernible so we are to deal with whatever want to deliver on front what you of the duration of the downturn on all the call been and have been very consistent saying historically a typical downturn is four to five quarter of negative comp and you have been saying since the beginning of this one Another way to at it is the shape of the recovery and some of the definition of the downturn is not yearoveryear being down but also of subseasonality we out of this how do you judge what the shape is likely to be and what sort of strategic step the make to prepare for either the bonanza side of thing or something a more muted you on this now you of cycle and almost for year in the and there is no predictable pattern of what it and so you you have watched u over the year a well you see thing slow get the operating plan right you get the inventory right make replenishing and make you can handle any combination you could show up be it slow or drawn out because there a macro issue on top or if people have over compensated ‘ the best example They turned down so hard it a strong snap back but clearly this one is deeper than ‘ and ‘ but nowhere near the deficit we saw back in ’ which is a great expectation we’ll make we’re able to handle whatever they want it to be the last on a macro side somewhat a more on the trade side with Huawei in your last call talked about adhering to all the rule of course stopping shipping and then restarting it Talk a bit about how you are able to ship because heard from so many different company have given u so many different answer on who can ship and why what allows to be able to ship it product you it very much and you it well make many of the company all make you are abiding by the letter of the law and make you understand what the term are and then once you get done looking at versus the product you could move so you we did through and were able to make those disposition and resumed forget if it three or four week after you cutoff on front heard when listened to other you both the earnings and in general everybodys you followed it much at the same way it depend on your product mix more than anything had for some company a temporary disruption in the demand pattern but it also had some differing impact on the supply side of thing Have you noticed any difference in the amount of channel inventory people are holding for fear of and adjusted anything a far a how you are addressing this shrinking part of your go to the channel careful and heard this again from for many year no one ever theyve inventory built up until the day demand is not a high and then they oops you inventory are built up see anything stand out on but am also careful of back to comment of thinking you have much insight into it are advantaged a you quite well and you talked about it been aggressive with the consignment because we keep a lot of in our hand or on our book and you watch the day we actually have in the channel be lower than any of our competitor Even if it up it’s not to be something mix u up too badly you mentioned about the consignment side of thing why don’t we pivot to a more comment and topic you’ve about twothirds of your revenue run through consignment these day and twothirds of the if the revenue go through did you make the original decision to change more to consignment the it more helpful to back up a opposed to a consignment or distribution only go back and about the commentary you hear from u of trying to build a model centered on four competitive advantage manufacturing technology breadth of our product reach of our channel and diversity and longevity were very very consistent on either want to be building those advantage stronger or leveraging so if you about the reach we have in term of the channel we have always had a long belief building closer direct relationship with our customer to be a helpful for the long about the thing watched consignment inventory change in distribution registration program whatever it five six seven year continuing to build our strength in our sale force building mass market sale team investment in TIcom many of the thing you’ve talked about for year when you visited and we’ve together and so to me this is all part of to continuum of evolving and it’s very logical are to be better served of inventory in one place and we are to be better served when we can truly see the demand of the true end customer way you eliminate the buffering or the buffering of buffering a lack of visibility of what true demand is and it to u run the better and do a better job for our customer in the long to me the consignment effort the latest phase we are working through now are part of you evolution of u getting closer to our customer and it to have a lot of advantage long there any negative on the revenue side in making transition talked about it in the last call you when you bring down recognize revenue that’s an inventory outlet channel and you are moving it internal you have a temporary it actually in some way you would permanent you are bringing revenue down you to me it get closer to what the consumption is and always a good a well Do you believe any of the reach benefit the distribution partner would claim a a strategic advantage of using them a something you sacrifice or is scale a unique offset to at the you when you narrated some of the debate back five and six year when we stopped the design registration we they don’t have influence and at what our market share done and especially mass market industrial and it only gone in one direction since then so and were uniquely not a statement for everybody in the semiconductor industry we have it because we plan for built out a sale force we build out an application team built our capability on TIcom and a a result of we can do a better job taking care of our customer directly the end customer want the work done efficiently and cost effectively and when it come to selecting component and getting them into production ramping them theyd rather do directly with the supplier and we are in a position to build and do Would you believe aggregate inventory what we see on your book and what you see a in the channel changed much during this evolution or is it more internal le external and it’s the same overall Probably hasnt changed much careful because havent done some calculation on but the more interesting longer is when we get to the other side of all these transition is it to u be even more efficient because we have thing in one place we can support customer throughout the world from you one centralized area meeting They give great leadtimes great availability you great service so we can react to customer Ive a feeling we can be efficient doing but it’s a early to make a projection on when you get to the other side is the other side defined by final of the being consignment a well there is no channel so to speak or is there some balance between the two at the end stage there is always you when it come to channel customer are the one need to be able to make decision on what they want to do want to make they have a good option of if they can do directly with u it be something we support and theyll see advantage in it and if they choose to do then that’s how we’ll support them long do you especially in the market product have very long life cycle obsolete capability of risk Is there such a a caring too much inventory If you at you and we’ve it and don’t care if it’s the product line you can go back to the BurrBrown acquisition the UNITRD acquisition both the product from National you do great part These thing are around for year and so ability to be very calculated on how you manage inventory internally when standard product many customer use you what five year of run rate of consumption look it let you actually be very thoughtful in term of some combination of diebankfinished good produce great service metric but also have very low risk of obsolescence Now that’s different than if in you big customer big vertical custom market where you a device is built for only one customer that’s a very different you world you have to play around one were towards it’s to be a very good one If we looked at down the road the consignment is higher in the mix of those more fragmented customer would be higher larger customer lower and the whole industrial automotive focus is better Another key part of this is manufacturing side guess we are one of the to go to the if not the to go to millimeter Right now you you are moving to the next phase of Talk a bit about the next move to millimeter talked about within the next few year the discussion you signed to do expansion down in and then it seems it not to be this itll be sometime after Has anything changed in the timing of due to demand or is it this is the progression it take to roll out with tax all the sort of jurisdiction you have u in the and about prior generation away for fed we qualified our FAB clean room it and we didn’t tool it and ramp it up until late you the clean room is not cheap but it actually is compared to when you put all the capital and people in it and so flexibility you’re not being worried about having a clean room a few year early is not something bothered me and it won’t bother me for the cycle and you go back to even back in with we put one in you we’ll be in a position and to guess if we have to ramp by or the end of we’ll be a position to do you can apply any growth what if scenario to where we are and figure out do we need to buy or all close enough a far a concerned do the fact and you can appreciate this by having it next to an existing facility the granularity of the capacity addition and the staffing addition put u in a position to be very responsive to demand where if you go build at a Greenfield site you essentially have to tool with a of factory to get it even running if it’s sitting right next to an existing one you can add critical tool for new facility and deal with your capacity and the incremental cost is actually very proportionate to the revenue it also put u in a position to be very responsive with fixed cost a we bring online aspect of the fixed cost you have been very opportunistic on with the fab year is selling used equipment and downturn have been useful in regard have to enjoy life Exactly Is occurring right now or is the equipment still because it seems everything is still too tight it’s one of these thing you when you get asked question of there be excess equipment there be the investor be in a lousier mood when come but well take advantage of it and there still some out there there is nowhere near what we saw back in and when we would pick it up from older equipment and do fab you a bunch from around the world we can still do some now you even it at last year Capital basically were assuming a higher percent of new equipment for this next round and doesnt mean it to be it mean were assuming if we can find used equipment because thing soften up then great well bring it in the beauty behind this is we could have every dollar spent on new equipment and the incremental margin and pay back on millimeter is stunning real impact economically is getting way for diameter leverage last on manufacturing side of thing when you of the millimeter side do you the benefit been more to TI’s margin or market share to keep life simple it’s a margin answer because you in the end when you can get the dye cost down a the calculation by at least and you’ve watched our fallthrough on incremental revenue over the four and five year and it’s reflected the advantage of having the majority of is the margin you can operate it at Are there technical benefit of lithography and precision and speed and different parameter in the process yes but it at the margin easier answer to is it’s a margin benefit actually missed out one last one on this Some other company have tried to obtained the millimeter benefit often time with foundry Have you noticed any change in the competitive environment and a of more pricing pressure from the competition or is it still a performance centric market performance centric and more importantly a last checked the Foundries aren’t terrible operation in term of what they sell the wafer to folk you at the profitability of the foundry supplier and you and the beauty of our model is we press you Kyle Flessner and his tem we want you a cost effective or better than the foundry and then the benefit of plus no market and it a wonderful me pivot over to a bit more in the competitive environment but directly on to the MA side of thing Back when started following you year one of the most active on MA and the space UNITRD and BurrBrown and then a decade or so later you did national you haven’t participated in this decade so much choosing more to buy your own stock instead of somebody else’s guess a question on the competitive intensity changed a some of the scale ramped up with some of the competition many year in ADIs of the world and it not to avoid this nature of a take it more to the and year have been destructive and meaning if you are a wellrun semiconductor more focused on what you do well le dabbling we’ve certainly done but a number of other company have a well Is MA part of yes it is but in general and again you followed the industry for year you’ve thing from late low run company have done a better job over the or year because it a more constructive environment doesnt mean it any le competitive we’ve good competitor we go out and do battle with them on a daily but the discipline in term of RD spending in term of capital spending you see a better disciplined industry compared to year guess is the environment is to continue way for the next and MA is part of not the majority of is my guess you it’s the natural maturing of the industry and people optimizing accordingly and again you’ve lived it You’ve watched you most investor in many company in denial from the late for year of when are we are to go back to and growth the fact is the growth is more or or whatever you number you want to apply and once people you get adjusted to you thing have you a better discipline Unless you about a when people thought were to grow or then to new norm exactly hasn’t worked out so far for them but… do you bigger is better in both and micro controller Is scale you believe it a benefit to you but others you it one of the core tenet you have other people trying to emulate would would something to competitive intensity we talked about it it’s a better behaved industry but surprised you see it either microcontroller or the side or any different behavior you the industry behave a differently but it not because the scale or other Is bigger better to a degree meaning you’ve to get above certain minimum if you about the competitive advantage mentioned earlier the scale to be able to play a millimeter internal game it hard to see even our largest competitor ever deciding to go back to so to guess they breadth of our product portfolio even with MA our largest nearest competitor still cant dent what we do affordability of building out a sale and application channel and reach it not something people are likely to do any day soon a long a you are above scale matter but you internally we spent a lot of talking about how you build the operation stronger you aim it at the best market and the outcome is being bigger a opposed to me go get bigger doesnt get you to stronger place but you do have to be you at critical size to be above of the reason were so you to use the word confident in our competitive advantage is looked at greatly on how easy is it to replicate you for somebody to build out what we have built out they a goal to put two or three more company together alone put together a wafer fab and an assembly test operation alone put together enterprise process them to operate a good backlog work to the least it difficult to replicate and and our you to me the ultimate test of your competitive advantage is your cash flow per share grow faster than your best competitor over the long you been able to do for the or year real test is can you go do it for another Only pivot off the MA and the competition side of thing and a bit about the product strategy have narrowed thing down over the year big in and then microcontrollers a well seems the microcontroller side decided to but the commitment seems to be bigger than the MC and might be over stating about the relative importance of those two market and why the growth rate seemingly have differed at time between the two there’s you a of piece highest would and it dangerous analogy but you which of your child do you love more and the answer is all of them and it not out of love and support they can all contribute to the long growth of cash flow it not you it’s for a very tangible reason the embedded which is a very different than the is one can be successful and successful over the long financials be different at margin and people ask well are you to what it take to get embedded up to margin we are not trying to press it we are trying to get it stronger each and make it growing and make it contributing from a fallthrough point of view the nearer meeting the or you change when revenue growth difference between and embedded we’ve historically difference hard to go explain them all is it customer mix is it you thing happening in the channel also and again you at all these company closer than do competitive microcontroller company have been a softer from a revenue point of view a well and so it embedded trend on my guess is we keep track of longer you all these thing return to parallel behavior because you embedded a you recall a great grower late ’ ’ and ’ heck it growing better than during timeframe for u now it’s a softer me pivot about minute left so if anybody have a raise your hand at this point where Ill keep my eye open but because there is so many hand up right now Ill make to continue with my let’s pivot over to the end market side of thing a bit for many many year talked about the focus on the industrial market but there other high performance market people focus on have been great driver of growth and profitability and cash flow etcetera the data center market and the common infrastructure market did you chose to do the industrial and auto versus thing the data center and comp side when neither one those of consumer behavior earlier you tend to avoid That’s fair but you go back and of the industry over odd year and again you’ve watched a lot of u you had mainframe and mincomputers drove a great deal of the unit growth and market growth in the and moved into in some way communication at a phase but if you at it personal electronics you where there were unit in the early there is unit annually between Smartphones Tablets PCs and whatever you you have to sit back and over the next year whats to be the best secular growth opportunity and doesnt mean were not to participate in com infrastructure it’s an important market it’s a good market were to you do better than our you hold our own on same in data center you the opportunity of industrial and automotive are different and to sit back believe year from now or year now and people are to if you werent in you couldn’t play and you couldnt compete long it all for a very simple reason of a content story and is if you take these the end equipment are mostly mechanical or a combination of electro mechanical and you work to make them smarter use le power be safer be earlier to use you pick your variable what are you to put equipment and put semiconductor on them believe and the date is playing out way even over the five or six year for u are fortunately doing well in good market and you now our job is to make you we keep driving at combination industrial up you mid automotive up in low combination above last and we keep pushing up that’s exactly where to go next If looked at five year down the road do you industrial let split him for now but you could answer to together if you wish but you combination is bigger and which one of the two do you is to be bigger percentage of five year from now relative to Oh the industrial is the biggest and is to be the biggest five year and year from now automotive keep pace but those grow larger we are also careful internally do not go around with a percent of mix a a goal you give engineer and theyve two variable they could mess with and we don’t want them messing with the other one so you we want to hold our position in personal electronics we want to hold our position in communication infrastructure and enterprise and then on top of we want to grow those absolute business in industrial and automotive what we’ve done for the five year and is what were challenging everybody internal to double down on for the next five you mentioned why targeted the industrial and automotive side the automotive side people get the content argument obvious Visible yep car more content than today car the industrial side if you conceptually hit it but it doesnt seem quite a that’s immediately to about but if you about trend factory automation more electronics whole content is dynamic take the market used to grow of midsingle digitish and accelerate over the next year grows faster than the last year the characterization you give is very accurate it not a easy to touch or feel also not a easy to analyze of your world of me try to get into equipment and break it down because you you have State House Industrial these start in what we’ve sector and you’re oh crap where we are now and then of it literally if not of end equipment and so the ability to analyze is hard By the way the ability to attack take very unique capability in term of sale team TIcom and the system to get to those to reach the beauty of it also very difficult for your competitor to take if gotten there and so it great dynamic term of the growth potential let’s stay with the is it historically the exact number it the ability to at least maintain meaning we could have a modest GDP and content growth put a multiplier on top of do you have a or or you industrial growth environment quite likely Even potentially maybe with a questionable global economy and mean or in the near but you depending on your view longer and then by the way can we do a better than so those to me are encouraging opportunity and the good news is we have to establish credibility we can do it carrying a good track record in both industrial and in automotive the thing we’re doing are working and were continuing to invest even more aggressively in those extended further Last end market for you mentioned about of holding serve on the com infrastructure and the personal electronic side of thing com infrastructure people often time ask me if is taking it focus off and is losing share for some reason or another are you attacking market now and between the embedded and the side what might be different in your approach versus transition so you been very clear and we at the starting forget five or six where we when you at the macro trend secular CapEx expenditure by operator is not to keep up go at their budget and their capital expenditure and so it to me the classic disciplined mistake of well the market to stop growing me double down and try to make up for it with market share which is usually when people do very bad thing what we is very clear and is were to bring down the investment on the embedded side because baseband portion of the is not to grow were to take up the investment because what they do is try to get more capacity more spectral efficiency across the spectrum they have and so we love whats on with growing and our in it is wonderful actually see in the number you try to understand a bit of why is embedded weaker and growing stronger that’s not all but it certainly one factor and so were to continue to do very well on the portion of com infrastructure and so it’s to be an important for a long for u Then the last topic want to hit on in the we have is it get u all the way down to the cash flow side of thing is of the key tenant and the story easiest to understand have done if about the metric get you down to cash flow obviously the revenue side margin FX those sort of thing you of hit on all of them except for the margin side Operating expense you run a tight a anyone if year somebody told me could run with of sale an RD would have ‘No Way’ but you have proven is very sustainable If thinking the next five or year what do you the biggest driver of margin contributor to cash flow and not we revenue we fall through rate but any other sort of lever you your unique to and is driving metric north so wont surprise you with you the answer still if you’re trying to put round number on it to fall through on the way in or on the way out is a good number to use we understand the five year have been over on the fall through on the way in but you see the advantage of millimeter product mix in the number of thing you’ve touched on and you it very well then on either the absolute margin or the absolute cash flow margin heard u it and repeat it here do not spend riveted on care far more about cash flow per share of growth rate over the long Now if margin can increase at the same revenue is growing were not to stop the margin or the cash flow margin up but we spent no trying to maximize those What owner want is and you give u great cash flow per share of growth over five year and year what generates reward for the owner very much where focus is made good progress on the margin and the absolute cash flow per share growth rate and you we’ll stay focused on that… Talk Hopefully haven’t surprised you with the response on bonanza surprise at all You’re shameful you',\n",
       "       'you take our from the with of go ahead for taking my my one when you reported three month thing we’re looking somewhat more downbeat or how would you characterize the current environment Is it similar Is it better Is it worse trying to put your outlook which is to sequential growth below seasonal trend but it still up to get a better of how seeing the broader environment versus three month Ill start and if want to add anything he welcome too a we stated the came in about a we expected and across the board all the end market performed about a we had expected We’ve completed our of yearonyear decline for if you at history thing are always different when you at cyclicality but thing are performing a we would expect only would add is were ready for any scenario economy strengthens were ready If it run sideways or if it weakens were ready both a strategic comment on how we position the focus on auto and industrial and product of but also operationally with our inventory strategy and other thing were doing to continue to strengthen the Do you have a followon to for my followon the sale to China how is the environment there assume you have a lot of direct exposure to Huawei whats the demand environment guess in China and outside of China are condition better outside of China within China how is the demand environment outside of Huawei before Huawei is about to of our revenue overall a mix of comms equipment and some handset in there and some other product if you at comms equipment overall it of our revenue had some nice growth in our product a talked about before if you from a regional standpoint there nothing unusual on talked about in the when there certainly if you at where we ship product not always indicative of actual end demand or and lookthrough those economy meaning we may ship into one region and may get packaged up and shipped to another region before it actually consumed overall about the region they came in a we expected and nothing unusual didnt see anything unusual this you for go to next please you are here now from with very much for taking the based on the comment you made it appears a though your view on the cycle hasnt changed over the of month you decided to delay the new fab what of thought process went into the decision to push the fab to clarify we back in our capital management call and have been saying since then we planned to begin building next factory in the next few year and hasnt changed a filing and it a proposed amendment to a local tax abatement schedule caused some confusion on topic to again a we back in those plan hadnt changed Do you have a followon do then back to the China situation realize your tends to be very sticky the backdrop impacted your ability to conduct in China at all have you sensed any the market share in your you is not at all and our market because theyre diverse and you see market share doesnt move around quickly it good quality market one of our competitive advantage being diversity and longevity help u in market this in situation in particular so you go to the next please you take our next from with you very much had a on margin flowthrough fallthrough and especially a it relates to utilization and inventory cash flow month which you always point u too correctly which is of in the same ballpark you had last but then inventory down the fall through the margin is much higher incrementally and it not the same every but if there something on there What are the put and take caused the incremental fall through to be higher Ill take the way you want to about it is our fall through a we have before is about to you want to at on a yearonyear even then this is sometimes a le a more but the right way to at it and this is actually right between and other would mention is over the longerterm over the last many year and we expect this to continue seeing the benefit of millimeter manufacturing is part of our competitive advantage manufacturing technology a we have talked about before it a structural cost advantage because of the geometry of the wafer and the relatively small incremental cost go into producing the millimeter wafer versus millimeter wafer we expect benefit to continue to accrue to margin and ultimately cash flow margin which is the one drive value for the owner of the Do you have a followon did and this is more blocking and tackling and you have correctly frame from calling a cycle because everybodys track record including my owner absolutely wrong on front but booking cancellation and lead time where are we on these metric you if you at those metric overall inventory in the channel and more broadly looking at of the cyclical metric you looked at Inventory and channel down about a day Still it about week and been steady at for a of quarter now Order rate when we at those looked normal a they came through Cancellations were down a bit from last but didnt change much then our lead time overall have stable Certainly they were stable a thing more heated in the industry but and of course there always area we would still be tight on but in general the lead time have very stable so you well go to the next please you take our next from with for taking my question on Huawei answered sort of generally but specifically what do you have embedded in your guidance regarding Huawei Are you still contemplating selling product to them are you not Whats in the guidance regarding customer I’d over this we obviously had halted shipment when the order given Since then resumed shipment of the product determined we could ship are in compliance with the regulation overall in this thing came in a we expected a stated before would be inclusive of communication equipment where Huawei would sit in our guidance we obviously have in for the if there something unusual we are keeping out our practice been to call out and there nothing unusual were planning on Do you have a followon do you the stockpiling and consignment overall strategy been doing it been on for a while much do you increased utilization over the last few quarter a been rolling out how much longer do you anticipate driving strategy before it reach completion me start and then you want to if you want to comment had an inventory strategy for many year continue to tweak it over make it better stronger a the cycle started in or so then we deploy some tool during to then take advantage of situation and use what we call our wafer start devoted an increasing share of to the lowvolume inventory strategy have built a lot of but it not complete incrementally it to be le than what it in the last few quarter because you get to obviously diminishing return at some point in Ill point out obviously you saw our inventory dollar were down Theyre actually down yearonyear inventory day were down even with those planned build of those lowvolume part and we feel good about being able to do in our operation part of your there what is the impact of consignment have on utilization no impact at all Basically it optically and by definition put more inventory on our book even if the inventory didn’t change in the channel it would put pressure and optically put pressure on our inventory and on a well want to make one more comment on this topic Remember what inventory is about right What is objective inventory not about maximizing utilization or margin or anything about maintaining high level of customer service what we have done is deployed our cash to inventory a inventory actually decreased we decrease we built some inventory of lowvolume part now put u in a great position a we move into the and beyond have inventory of low volume is generally difficult to build have it ready so well be able to serve our customer on the other side of this very well you we go to the next please you hear now from with ask a want to stick on the consignment topic but a slightly different spin in the last call last few call it upwards of twothirds of your revenue go through consignment increased substantially over the last three five year do you your yearoveryear revenue performance is so similar to your broader peer group if controlling inventory would all else being equal you wouldnt have to deal with the distribution channel burning inventory and weighing on your revenue during a this Ill give you one comment and you may want to chime in What would tell you is maybe take into account in the last four quarter or so five quarter we have gone through the next phase of consignment and we have added let to of revenue to program per during for a total of close to still have one more to go where is where to happen and maybe through the end of the but it getting to the diminishing point is revenue from the PL we had sort of disappeared right but obviously the demand hasnt changed end demand hasnt changed now it go into our inventory and the revenue delayed but it put u in a much better position to then own inventory distribute it better where it needed work with our manufacturing facility better to determine whats needed to be built for to replenish inventory it a better way to operate and Ill to add when you of one of our competitive advantage which is the reach of our market channel this is one component of what were doing to have a closer more direct relationship with our customer we ultimately servicing them better with product benefit them and therefore benefit u Do you have a followon one a bit more housekeeping an end market point of view you went through and gave the yearoveryears could you give the quarteroverquarters beyond the comms side there a reason you put industrial and automotive together saying there were down upper singledigits yearoveryear Usually you split those the is they performed similarly Industrial a weaker Auto a le weak but in the same zip code and the same for the sequential Together they grew low singledigits and same profile the same Personal electronics grew high singledigits with broadbased seasonal growth Comms equipment a mentioned earlier had declined and then enterprise system actually grew you we’ll go the next please you now hear from with afternoon for taking my Looking at the most recent data sale were down about yearoveryear for the global while you were only down clearly outperformed the last a well outside of the end market mix ie better comm equipment you help u understand any product area where either capturing market share or seeing strong dollar content growth yes so I’d always be careful to read too much into any of those number in the shortterm when you at the share gain they need to be even over several even in case we out very well especially we continue to do well in industrial and automotive mentioned earlier is we believe those be the most important market to semiconductor and industrial in particular a lot of program and a lot of thought into how to get better and get stronger to be able to service those market Do you have a followon for the insight there we have to be careful on how we interpret this number but can you tell u what the booktobill ratio is for the you set me up perfect there because always have the preamble Ill give it Ive debated honestly whether should continue to give it but because we do but there is a lot of noise in it it and it a yearago and last so and Ill everyone we have the majority of the revenue on consignment we get order in advance for backlog and the consignment the order in the backlog are all consistent with the guidance we gave you believe we go to the next please you hear now from with you about the linearity of order during the guess more specifically have you any change in customer or channel behavior since the Huawei reinstatement and the guess the threat of in additional tariff taken away a few week no change on front when we at the linearity it came in fairly normal minus the stock shipment to Huawei once we determined we could continue to resume most of those product back to normal quickly Do you have a followon were in this guess mildly depressed or sluggish or flaccid or whatever you want to call it of environment Have you changed your thought on of longterm CapEx short answer is no are a we in our capital management strategy our guide on CapEx is and well continue to be and without building of course a talked about we announced the new factory the new millimeter factory we build in Richardson in the next few year Outside of well be running about you operator we’ve for one more call you take our next from with for taking my you hear me can inventory declined in dollar and day What do you happens to your inventory on your balance sheet in the on the inventory commentary believe you you characterized channel inventory a of in a stable Would you call them stable in a normal and healthy would you characterize them somewhat differently me start and if you want to jump in me step back to the objective for inventory to everybody and a earlier in the call is to maintain high level of customer service also want to minimize obsolesces of inventory and improve our asset utilization but the main is to maintain high level of customer service our target is to last two quarter we went above target then last were at in one and then we finished at so both of those of our target add again even outside of those number we’ve made good progress of executing to building those low volume part and we believe important so we can continue to service customer well the part of your yes it down a bit on the day’s in distribution still at about week is a healthy would number structurally of work it way down a were implementing more of this revenue on consignment and a great for our distributor a great for our customer and it require we’ll be carrying some more inventory on our balance sheet but we a good investment in working capital Do you have a followon please you followup is have you been noticing since the and China trade debate Have you been noticing any shift in the supply chain from a standpoint of where thing are being manufactured not your own supply chain but where shipping to are you shipping more outside of China or is everything fairly stable you Ill take too early to tell read some of the same medium report and anecdotal comment people make on front but it too early to tell well watch how thing evolve in front over the next few year want to finish with a few comment on key item for everybody to remember remain focused on and embedded the best product and industrial and automotive the best market continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning cash flow to the owner of the finally we continue to believe growing cash flow per share dollar over the longterm is what maximize value for the owner of the you for listening be on the web and have a good night you today you all for your may now',\n",
       "       'you want to focus mainly on fundamental and longterm thing but before we go there … have to cover the shortterm to yes for a few question there obviously the big elephant in the room is China and Huawei how is managing through this turbulent macro climate were in especially when it come to China and a customer Huawei maybe me address the environment including China we starting in or so we talked about in our earnings call and different session we were entering into what we characterize a a semiconductor downturn meaning worldwide GDP not changing at least not changing much what driving the industry trend down your normal semiconductor cycle so draining off of customers’ inventory Historically those lasted about a four five six quarter because you have two year of running above trend to have a or so running below trend and how the industry worked and continue to work then we took necessary step to manage through in the longterm frankly it doesnt matter it doesnt matter this end market are to grow the content is to grow and were well positioned for in the shortterm we do take some step and been taking those step in term of inventory and different thing the dynamic at the highest is not different in China Of course you have the trade tension and different thing the concern there of course is the trade escalation could lead to a macro event and then were not talking about the semiconductor downturn and we could be talking about an economic recession would have bigger implication of course not something we control we were in a good position to handle whatever the economy throw at u given our strategic position and our operational stand on good you for calling nearterm Moving to more longterm thing and Ill start sort of more highend and then well bring it down to some of the segment did an analysis looked at the last upcycle lasted from to you did a phenomenal job on return analysis especially return on capital your cash flow per share growth also solid during Now we are in “a downturn” what are you doing to try and get similar return for the next six year mean back then you were coming off of National acquisition youd bought a lot of equipment for and What are you doing or planning now to to try and have a similar performance for the next six year or whenever the upturn happens yes well several thing and it come under some of the thing mentioned earlier but the one is continuing to invest where the growth is to be which is industrial automotive about world stop growing and would be bad but for a of scenario Are we to have more EVs a a proportion of car than before so it’s likely it not for but it likely the industrial front are we to have more automation in factory Are we to have more automation in the grid or more electric content to manage the EV charge in the grid Are we to have more semiconductor accompanying medical Right even if we have period of macroeconomic uncertainty or even a contraction we still see a tremendous opportunity in industrial automotive were to continue investing in one were doing other were working on is expanding our competitive advantage which one is we have the broadest portfolio and my RD comment applies to a we continue to expand in there the other one is manufacturing and technology have the were the only player with it own millimeter factory for integrated circuit of now we have recently announced were to expand and build a standalone factory also in millimeter were continuing to expand our region why is important millimeter at the chip is le expensive than millimeter give you a huge advantage to deploy in those way good moving on to some of the end market and you talked about obviously EV and factory automation let start with automotive clearly a very attractive market for and embedded from perspective the one problem with is everybody know it so everybody is investing in it obviously is always to be somewhat fragmented but it seem some of your digital peer are starting to invest more dollar in automotive how should we about dynamic over the next five to seven year a more and more company start pouring capital onto the automotive market which by the way historically more sort of the and microcontroller right mean you didnt see a lot NVIDIAs and the Intels and the Qualcomms getting into market how could change the dynamic Ill give you some comment if you want to add we compete against some of those internally even if a lot of those are getting into doesnt matter to u right spectrum of competitor it’s a very fragmented industry but it consolidated over the year even the more trying to get in we still generally a smaller pool at the end of the day what the most important come down to our competitive advantage Those are the same thing give a leg up in competing in all market but auto is the same mentioned millimeter well give u a big advantage are to have the lowest cost player in an industry where price is not the number one number two number three maybe number five care about but it still put you in a good position to compete and then generate more cash flow Having the broadest portfolio also very important for any customer you want to deal with fewer supplier also more important than when you engage with a customer then and you deploy the RD resource for a product and you deploy the sale resource and engage with a customer not selling one or two product you can sell or different product the dynamic and the scalability becomes very different for and it advantageous for you to compete and I’d add the automotive market and any market when you at it we always at it through the lens of risk of commoditization of course there be part of market our market commoditize the general structure of it lends itself to meaning if you at only unit a might sound a lot but compared to the cellphone market it’s significantly smaller from a scale then if you at the top one or two manufacturer there are around unit each and then each of those have five six seven platform go into it there a lot of fragmentation in the market itself if you at where our growth from it’s from very diverse area five sector are contributing to growth in automotive four of them significant our investment continue to go across those five sector service close to OEMs and of course thatll be a combination of Tier and could imagine the revenue be skewed to the Tier any given Tier ship a of thousand different skews into very different again if you at a cellphone there a of key component go into it and everybody beat the crap out of each other to get those few component Now are there area can commoditize offer a tire pressure sensor point something per car time now talking hundred of and there not much differentiation between the low end and the high end all the same there be area should commoditize Of course steer investment away from those area moving on to the industrial market where there obviously a lot of electronic content growth happening and it very it hard for u investor to see it right because we see the industrial customer are doing special thing would this is clearly an example where skill matter right you have more than customer you have the biggest FAE force out there in the space is this to be the true competitive advantage for you in the industrial space guess even from educating those customer to use electronics how you’re about doing so it doesnt matter doesnt matter Youre talking there are big player there too but for the most part it’s about the medium to small sized player then matter from scalability have failed so a mentioned earlier right If to call into a customer you only have one part to sell not to work math doesnt work need to have different part you can sell If to do your RD and release a part you can’t sell it to one customer the math doesnt work the volume are not high enough to sell it to different industrial customer right yes those are the there a part to your I… how do you educate industrial customer to use more electronic well right other angle were taking on for this is reference design and been in reference design for decade so not new what is newer is over the last four or five year we’ve formed team are dedicated to this market there one team that’s dedicated to industrial one that’s dedicated to automotive and these thing are across the world they focus on and it not a generic reference design it is were trying to get very granular a to not reference design for a washing machine but for the power board of this portion of the washing machine Y and Z in a particular way you to get good at doing then is important for small customer because they have the engineering staff They have two or three engineer there be other very good engineer but they everything there is to about power signal chain and the subelement and these other thing the more and we have the scale to enough about not to do what they do right take them up to a certain point and they add differentiation in their own product it help to take a of the way or whatever it is in process most importantly for u it make it incentivizes and put in a position to be selling more and more of those part on board instead of part we can design in or different part on board Got it good then moving on to market which is communication talked about being le of a strategic market for you from timetotime opportunistically you participate obviously is of right now the one Ive always asked myself is when it come to why hasn’t the participated more in RF right obviously now we about RF becomes a important part of the market Is it simply because it such a volatile market the return on investment is not there or any other reason if you at RF and the sheer dollar of it there a large portion that’s steered towards personal electronics cellphone in particular and there not a lot of differentiation and a very tough place to live there other part of the market use RF but of in aerospace or other form of it bet you can’t find differentiation it’s a good example is when we at our portfolio overall every significant area covered but there always niche where we won’t participate so a good this is of the structure of the market If you at now we’re not in power amplifier but other RF product converter filter amplifier and thing fit in RF chain it not were absent but not in the power amplifier you had strong growth over the last month in market assume there’s still growth there long tail to the next few year should we about TI’s in for the next few year me maybe one comment on comms equipment which is what we define a we call market last of our revenue Auto and industrial combined were of our revenue even personal electronics bigger at it’s a relatively small part of our revenue Almost all of it is certainly on a go the RD we are putting into space is we if there to be any growth there it’s to be in the reason for it is the ATTs of the world their CapEx is to be flat for year to because people in this room are not willing to pay more for everybody look up when you’re not willing to pay more for your service People want to pay more so then ATT is to spend more and if theyre not to spend more mean the supplier are not to get more there the pie not growing it to shift a bit and we more be spent and le digital is still to be constrained right why we are limiting the opportunity Whereas contrast with automotive right Automotive EV mean some people are asking for but a lot of is government saying they have to go EV so then there no choice spend in there go up on industrial industrial pay for itself you automate a factory you make it cheaper you make it more efficient right you make thing safe or better in industrial space also pay for itself so we see where we see the content growing a distinction between those two end market and the comms equipment market you for perspective that’s great Back to some more structural thing there a lot of thinking right now with the trade war with China China is to hunker down and now developing own semiconductor and there even been some suggestion they started more in memory and processor and that’s not panning out so you now could actually go and build an telling you whats been out there Whats your view on China building it own havent it a an analyst for the last year would love to hear your perspective no our is the China they want to lessen their dependence on United States that’s everybody in position do the same the same competitive advantage help u against our traditional competitor are the same one have and continue to help u against any effort to in China to go after the space and why China over the last what they focused on are the easier and frankly the more rational area to attack which are memory digital because you can make a very targeted investment get a few part on a very process technology within a few year you can have revenue mildly profitable revenue but you get some revenue and then you reinvest and then you keep at right need the huge sale channel because selling also to a relatively smaller customer base and relatively smaller product Now to go to a we were talking earlier you need at least several thousand different part to get started right for the dynamic we talked about earlier to be able to go against u where we have different part ourselves is daunting even if you had a few thousand part need one technology to go out you need dozen of process technology and then you need thousand of different product each of those their own idiosyncrasy and IPs and different thing it not a take IP from wherever and go deploy it you to build a whole library of different thing even then even if somebody had all it would be very difficult to deploy right we we have some inherent advantage in doesnt mean theyre impregnable If somebody want to go at it they could make a dent at but would take decade our job is to not stand still which we’re not we always continue to strengthen our advantage good point other topic is sort of market share you obviously have grown organically and also made some acquisition now approximately at share of the market during the last upcycle you didnt make any acquisition whereas a lot of other company around you have been consolidating and buying company why is mean is it simply because evaluation didnt make or is it quite simple you didnt find any attractive asset you wanted to go after me step back and everybody of our criterion for acquisition right it to be strategic fit u mean company only we at anything but focused on industrial and automotive catalog product but not custom product but catalog product for so many reason talked about earlier and differentiated product That’s a tough criterion not many company would fall would need all those then the price to be right mean we can hit our WAC within three or four year for example and this is on cash flow this is not earning accretion this is cash flow if my WAC is for argument sake buy something for within three or four year would be giving me buck from there keep on growing there also tough criterion to meet Now me take an even broader step back not missing anything on our portfolio frankly the other not looking for something to complete my portfolio were not Arguably with the National acquisition we were missing some piece related to industrial in particular and helped fill and at the moment were good we’re developing hundred of product every more process technology to continue to staying ahead of the competition on financial metric and MA and not suggesting or asking for you to change it want to hear your perspective because obviously evaluation in the semiconductor space continued to go up every right If you at the last year it’s continued to creep up and if a function of consolidation is a function of more market now who know but the reality is the evaluation kept up do you then adjust your view on evaluation or you continue to maintain three or four year that’s it never never in those thing and evaluation is such a subjective art form which everybody in this room appreciate the one carry would give you profitability improved in the industry when you evaluation am not we are talking absolute evaluation or relative evaluation but profitability improved clearly tax reform helped u not every but many company were … yes we to take into account we’ve been firm with our criterion and to stay good we have a few more minute question Question Inaudible could you repeat the so how quick we could adjust to tariff tariff have been placed so far have had virtually zero impact to u directly direct impact China not put tariff on semiconductor and the did but of what we ship is outside of the United States even what we ship into United States is very of is from China we havent had any direct impact we expect any can never rule out because in a trade war thing can people can do irrational thing but it would it wouldnt make for China to put tariff on semiconductor because they need for their own production and export industrial Question Inaudible am sorry left but embedded is more cyclical Question Inaudible Ill give you my perspective if you want jump in if would call it most cyclical cyclicality seems to be a out of phase with by a few quarter and no one sits in a while looked at it internally not quite why there some theory it higher EPs the decision are made sooner wouldnt characterize it necessarily a more cyclical the return get this in different way and this is where but is more profitable than embedded if you around the industry company are more profitable than embedded company right our embedded what it last something profit from operation good theyre generating good cash flow they have to be a good a they have to be a part of contributor to cash flow I’d add when you at this particular cycle a were working our way through it there are some fundamental difference and the strength in comms equipment is driven by content increasing it benefiting from some of the difference between the two would be a lot le with or without but there still be some difference but that’s fine for the current cycle it’s right helped a bit last quick one because were running out of Question Inaudible Ill speak for of course see in the space not in embedded in the space there’s value in owning our own manufacturing particularly millimeter mentioned earlier we a huge cost advantage If we were to outsource CSMC would get advantage they would monetize which they do some of our competitor tell you they do use with CSMC and other factory theyre not getting the benefit of it then on top of you can have the argument of owning the technology right that’s also important but primary reason is the cost advantage good running out of want to and for coming to our and you to all you for coming to the session and enjoy the rest of your day you you',\n",
       "       'maybe a a start give u your of of the state of the union where we are now versus what you thought at the start of the maybe start even higher those who are not familiar we’re a in semiconductor industry focused on the best product and we and embedded and then the best market of which is industrial and automotive Those are the area been allocating our capital too There’s lot of natural competitive moat around the and Embedded market and we they’re great market to the more of the near a we ran up to the end of the and up to we had what a ten quarter of yearonyear growth Most of doubledigit a you all of u in the industry we don’t if that’s to be ten quarter or quarter or quarter if you see growth but you at some point it to weaken and rollover saw sign of start in the continued in to in the and obviously our guidance suggest continue we stay out of the game of calling the bottom or predicting how long the cycle last we pay attention to it and operate of our thesis on the product and the market we’re investing in of on a three and fiveyear horizon remain unchanged and we’re keeping our nose down and grinding away see Got it you whats been common to most downturn and it sound of obvious is inventory cycle right the secular aspect of the industry been there for many year but what of been driving these cycle that’s inventory Do you this around there is anything different about the cycle where inventory more elevated versus what you had in prior guidance whether it on your own balance sheet Whether it’s at the customer Like is there anything you is different about this can help u get some clue a to when we might be able to out of it and talked about this before if you over the last year We’ve had nine up cycle and we’re working our way through the ninth down cycle and some of those are short so you want to dismiss them some are unusual for other way and you want to dismiss those now you’re down to handful of cycle to judge which you and have had enough math both Right there not much you can draw statistically from single data point right careful in trying to predict to any of cycle are driven by human behavior and not changed for century that’s when operating team get on Monday morning they get a note from some other supplier lead time are out They put in a week of inventory to protect themselves and might extend for a of quarter and at some point their CFOs to have to to the and face investor and he’s hey who this please get many week of inventory and it go back down the other direction the basic of what drive the inventory cycle Got it if you were to of contrast your visibility about There’s a lot of enthusiasm about the half doesnt give longer outlook but there’s a lot of expectation enthusiasm guess hope there’s to be a half rebound If you sort of at your visibility around the half contrast with prior year is there anything different or similar there are some thing are different and if go back and at it we four competitive advantage at the and you’ve heard u about them before of manufacturing and technology the reach of our market channel our broad product portfolio and longlived and diverse position you at the one of the reach of our market channel so at any we’ve a dozen initiative that’s to strengthen those four competitive advantage the outcome of one of them strengthening reach of channel the belief we wanted to have a closer more direct relationship with our customer because we those control interface over are the one thatll win economically how came out of our consignment program you’ve heard u about those thing before we believe there strategic value in owning and controlling inventory out in the channel and sitting on our book in those arrangement we get any advanced order don’t carry a backlog our customer invest in tying their planning system into ours we can see usually on a daily out six month of what they’re planning to build Theres no inventory there we get a best visibility a you can get on what theyre planning to build Now our visibility end at manufacturing line see their WIP see their finished good don’t see down into their channel and always caution don’t confuse visibility with stability because can change quickly yes so we that’s twothirds of our revenue different than what it a decade a you you at in crystal ball do you hope and enthusiasm about a half rebound are justified We’ve tried a hard a we can not to weigh into debate have plenty of peer provide entertainment and we’ll listen to it other than being on Twitter hour a day what else can do to plan your properly What are you doing differently given this of uncertainty a of thing made the comment with cycle those are surprise when they’re to show up how long the last you operated them mentioned before our investment havent changed and our view on the opportunity in automotive and industrial remains unchanged the investment there remain unchanged some thing on in China you have to pay attention to in fact our had a planned trip to China two week cant remember when the announcement came out for the stop ship on Huawei Thursday or Friday he showed up there the following Monday and perfect timing because you can imagine the team there anxious with all the change on and advice to the team very simple and direct you is your job to be harder with trade tension to be when you have a rising power challenging an established power whether you have a resolution in the short are you still to have trade tension for decade to you likely are so accept it there’s to be two of company out of this those figure out how to do well and prosper in of environment and those cant figure out and we’re to work hard to make we figure it out the attitude of getting beyond the emotion the denial the fear all of the stuff come with and get on with thing and figure out a way through it want to get into China but before from a clarification perspective how important is Huawei a a customer for last there were of our revenue overall you can imagine with comms equipment space growing a aggressively a it and the other market getting weaker it a higher percentage than not insignificant but certainly doesn’t change economics of the where you down to competitive advantage of diversity and longevity not dependent on any given customer or technology or product at one of our customer for a revenue the exposure is all on the infrastructure side or is it on the phone side a mix of both and they make actually a few other thing we’re in but those two are the largest and obviously be skewed to the communication equipment side in China wanted to discus and there are aspect to it right is China a part of your costbase right and in term of whether there is any impact of tariff Then there is China a a customer right Overall a you’ve heard is you if you ever see competition are there substitute for what you do from a China perspective on the cost side what is the impact of all the tariff do you you have managed to of offset a lot of those impact of it the direct impact is real easy to measure and it a number very close to zero way the law written in our industry country of origin is defined much by assembly test so it to be assembled and tested and we do have assembly test operation in China and then it to be shipped into the we have a half a dozen assembly test site most in Asia one in Mexico we can move thing around the day it announced well le than and we mitigated even very small percentage secondary impact to customer and thing is very difficult to measure but in general do we tariff are bad and do they ultimately destroy demand economic theory say it that’s not something we’re big fan of obviously see an assembly and test perspective hypothetically can you completely move out of China we could given enough and energy… Like requalification and those thing they stand in the way could but don’t we’d want to right China continues to be an important market is more opportunity than threat or problem there a earlier we’re to figure out how to be successful there Got it now from a customer perspective when we at the from last it had China a a customer the ship to of destination Give u a for what is actually demand from indigenous China and how much is actually shipped there but then is exported overseas and you’ve stuff in both direction right a you is what we ship into China the address but a large cell phone manufacturer or of what we shipped to them go to China and obviously go to place around the world we could ship something into European Tier automaker get shipped into a BMW and put on a ship and sold into Beijing right you stuff in both direction given our breadth number we’ve customer belief is end consumption is reflective of what GDP is a percentage of revenue so high teen pushing or so of revenue end up staying there Got it You’re not over indexed in anyway right versus whatever the GDP contribution Correct last one the assumption is when we at Chinas the internal motivation to of be more selfsufficient in semiconductor Usually people about memory or foundry or more digital and logic hear about China investment for example in Is the reality also and do you see China being le of a competitor is it harder for them What is so hard about Indiscernible when nation or region are looking at and you at history of how Europe entered the semiconductor market and then Japan entered and then Korea entered the pattern the same right They all picked memory why do you pick number one it a big part of the overall market Theres only a few part number run at any one Theres customer make up a large portion of demand figure out how much market share you want to have and how many wafer fabs there is and you put in place and go knock on the door of those customer and an entry into the when you at our were the largest player in and last we were about right and if you found the largest customer and the largest device at it looking at million of dollar right trying to figure all stuff out is a harder and not typically where government go to dump their money If they had the money and the inclination what is so hard about command such good margin there lot of reason and those reason from the product are unique Many of them can be substituted once theyre chosen theyre proprietary the average selling cost is the switching cost is much higher than any saving youd get near Those are built on proprietary process technology at company by very highly specialized and hard to find design engineer and unique design development tool flow are tied to those process technology Again the diversity is a challenge support network everything you need to be able to get to market is a challenge not showing up at company and asking how many unit they want right could go on longer but those are the type of thing make it difficult to enter andor to actually gain share even with incumbent Got it Is it a similar situation in microcontrollers because seems to be a lot more competitive market there are supplier in Asia a well you in Europe a well Microcontroller seems to be a lot more competitive market an you can find pocket of it are more competitive those higher volume runner if entering into microcontrollers and chasing high volume opportunity and using an ARM processor and building at TSMC and using a OSAT to do your assembly test and there no differentiation in the peripheral using thirdparty design tool chain a ugly place to live right Theres company do thing if you an have the way you make money and embed it a you have a few of architecture instruction set architecture a you can you get a many customer and a much revenue on it you offer differentiated product the core or the instruction set becomes the engine in a car Does it need to have one Is the reason why one buy a car it everything else sits around it becomes the differentiation you find those thing and find their way into all kind of different device Again a microcontroller the average selling price might be somewhere between and you the added software infrastructure over it make it harder to switch they switch are they to switch for or a nickel too much work to do you to be very selective Got it automotive and industrial are more than half of your right now pick these area if for example you long semiconductor a a GDP plus growth industry what give you the confidence being an automotive and industrial help you outgrow the industry a simple thesis three five even year there be more content and those end market than what there is you at other market personal electronics and if you had tablet and PCs and handset and everything else we make a an industry about of those thing produced last people on the planet There’s a threeyear replacement cycle stretch into four number isnt to double in five and year Same in comms equipment and the enterprise market only a of percent so it not meaningful force overall Got it whats also being very unique to been the share gain you have had consistently in these industrial and automotive market point doesnt sound a lot but when you start compounding it right it start… Decade it make a big difference show up what helped get this market share on a consistent Does it have to do with your millimeter strategy or what are the key underlying driver help you stay on this consistent share gain what would point to the four competitive advantage a the reason why been able to do it Manufacturing and technology is one about millimeter the most obvious example of advantage but there other advantage and technology and making the product differentiated the other two are obvious is the product the breadth of the product portfolio attract more customer when we engage with more customer we more product to be able to sell then the reach of our channel tidotcom get more traffic because of the breadth of the portfolio those two thing work together then the one is somewhat le understood because the diversity mean were not dependent on any model of launch of a phone or any of one of our customer’s product Now well benefit from but were not dependent on it or of the cycle still shipping product right well benefit when show up but were not counting on it or write it down on a on a date of hey we have to have happen to be able to gain share we can gain continue to gain share even a these different cycle elongate or contract we can we can benefit is the combination of those four thing Got it Now one about is so you sell power management product Maxim Linear Tech right you have you have other competitor a customer choose which of the power management product Like do they buy more from because you might have SKUs have a broader Is it easier to order from ticom Like what turn a customer towards the product versus because from the outside it look there are many company do power management a customer go and make decision in and were both engineer so engineer are pragmatic and if it easier to choose something theyll choose it in any product there could be or different spec define and there may be a handful half a dozen maybe a dozen matter there are some application where well have the right product fit very naturally and well have a slight advantage may be others and you listed a of our peer good company theyve great product too and there be some where theyve the advantage on those few spec Now an engineer can if theyre approaching the problem differently or designing something else those may be minimized and they could open up the window of what they could choose from again these are on average decision right there not a committee of people sitting around making the decision is engineer once you have an engagement with them typically through the web we want to make a easy a possible for engineer to design in the product theyre looking for but also get other product in front of them are to naturally work with now our peer are trying to do the same not unique doing doing it well doing it consistently having the right product suggesting the right product at the right is all part of what make engine go Got it made the decision a few year to not use distribution right for demand creation you still use them for demand fulfillment retrospect been a good strategy or do you it of reduce some of the leverage you might have had otherwise in term of getting your product to a bigger customer base are few thing in life are so clear this a nobrainer talked about how invested in demand creation and with engagement of customer we could see the distributor didn’t play a role in we stopped paying for a service we werent getting there many of our peer are maybe doubling even doubling down on their investment there and may work for them and may be appropriate were you six seven year into journey and we have continued to execute and have better visibility and better granularity of what we need to do to engage with customer than what we had back then Do you you have more traction with ticom than your competitor do with their portal been investing in it for quite some and we could give our to any of our competitor and put their product on it and the process we use because of the breadth of our product portfolio theyre not to get the traffic across it Theyre not to get the ability and the amount of repetition if you from the analytics engine getting smarter because of traffic is it an advantage it not the durable advantage out there is the traffic and the breadth of the portfolio of working together make the difference Got it other made somewhat unique in the industry been the early adoption of millimeter Where show up in term of a relative differentiation Like we should it show up in faster sale growth rate right it shown up in better margin where it actually practically shown up in your PL can see it clearly is we qualified millimeter back in the product and we our revenue in up through this last we produced believe of revenue last on on millimeter even if the beauty of from millimeter of inch to or inch the surface area of wafer is time bigger so if building the same product on bigger sized wafer you get time the number of product it doesnt take time the number of people or electricity or gas and it translates into a structurally lower cost show up in lower cost higher margin whichever way you want to at it believe also there is a advantage of controlling those asset and owning them because a product team a they have different requirement to make their product differentiated over more control of those asset for to a foundry partner trying to convince them to make change to a standard based process technology not an advantage and so we’re to show up on one or even one of market share gain you put together over five and and year it to make a difference on the product portfolio right What percentage of your and embedded product are on millimeter and where do you see them over the next few year planning to make further investment in millimeter roughly of our revenue last on millimeter you two wafer fabs are in the footprint and were in the planning process of the and we recently announced at Richardson would be the site of where well build factory break ground in the next of year some to make decision but a always say he want to be two year early and not two month late with capacity because it an asymmetric investment and it something we want to do of every incremental dollar of coming in be built on millimeter much what done over the last decade embedded anything at nanometer and below were actually outsourcing and well continue to outsource most expensive part of our industry manufacturing footprint is advanced CMOS and there a portion of the product portfolio continue to build inhouse what proportion of embedded is on would most of it on embedded being more of a digitally based technology the industry went year to so transition is mostly complete Got it Make Theres access to also give you a competitive advantage Like when you go and with customer are they more able to trust because you have a lot of your own internal capacity and way to scale maybe on the margin a we talked about earlier and you can of of our interaction with customer in two large fee reserve demand creation and where engineer are choosing product and selecting and then order fulfillment of once it go to manufacturing and it passed off over here order of fulfillment team the operation team our customer love the fact plenty of capacity wafer fabs and our footprint give u any volume of we love those of problem to go off and solve at the same were servicing lot of small customer with lot of SKUs youll see u do program building inventory of small volume part to ensure our lead time and availability remain high even for those type of customer are in footprint all of those thing of flow from strengthening those competitive advantage and ensuring were taking care of our customer Got it me see if there are any question from the audience If not me continue margin you your margin have you are in the of low to mid the fallthrough been actually been higher over the last few year you have a good to have a you increase the amount of loading on millimeter should we anticipate higher margin fallthrough Simple answer is yes every dollar come in itll be structurally lower cost in our capital management presentation we did back in an example of a part sell for dollar at sixty point of profit on millimeter you move over to millimeter and it point higher in profit on a blended at the a dollar of revenue of fall through at to point it not meant to be precisely mathematic but in any it can vary a it often but a reasonable way to about Got it Is it fair to a lot of the shouldnt call them easy picking but if historically over the last decade automobile there a lot of benefit you had because depreciation higher than CapEx lot of those benefit seem to be in the rearview mirror right Youre obviously on automobile Depreciation is now actually equal or actually more than CapEx is there some stalling out of margin you see at these level so if you if we translate into how we about thing were trying to optimize cash flow per share growth over a long of if you at five year of cash flow growth it been of in low double over those period of for the most of been without any revenue growth on top of it if you and about a semiconductor world if GDP is semiconductor and you have an estimate some maybe at but somewhere in right if you have a a starting base we and embedded grow about the rate of of the industry overall argument for faster or slower but theyre big enough theyll grow at the rate of the market then every dollar come in fall through at to point to give you some lift on cash flow per share margin and maybe add another point or two then if Market behaves himself and we can continue to buy back share we reduce share count and grow at another point or two faster comfortably without twisting spreadsheet somewhere in the upper single digit if all those thing line up to have a shot at something done in the last five and year right of how we about growth overall and the opportunity in front of u see term of MA it been a few year since engaged right in any major acquisition interesting this despite all the worry about broader cycle in China and environment they’ve had seven or eight semiconductor deal announced so far Crazy time right crazy time exactly when become crazy the next we remain disciplined is the best way I’d talked and it remains unchanged for sometimes even before we bought National so strategically wed for an high quality product diverse revenue an easy way to summarize it is would an acquisition strengthen your competitive advantage or leverage them and ideally it to do both then of the category is it make financial a an to allocate capital to well at a lot of different financial metric of of the classic is your return on invested capital higher than your lack in a reasonable timeframe Some of my favorite are looking at our cash flow per share be growing faster five and year from now with the acquisition than without it so those are of some of the hurdle and finding the target not the difficult part in the equation is making it make financial a an to allocate the capital way see is it there are not enough target or is it they are either too expensive or doesnt need the financing There’s plenty of target out there right the issue it more of it make financial to do Got it one we have is a lot of excitement in the whole opportunity you definitely participating but not sounding a enthusiastic or jumping up and down about the opportunity Have you u jump up and down about any opportunity but would be included to the extent there is to be an upgrade cycle over the next handful of year how is positioned Which part of do you have competitive differentiation do you it a real opportunity for you it clearly a real opportunity Comms equipment is of our revenue overall last and our basic thesis on comms equipment is if you at the world the number of subscriber is saturated revenue per user hasnt moved in a very very long you at the ability of operator to double CapEx over the next five or year isnt there so the spending in we believe for the industry overall could move up but is it to double it to double talked about in some of those other market over any looking at with in particular and if you go back to our capital management strategy and youll see back six seven year is when we began to invest in saw our digital investment are down and the investment are up slightly why is if you at the opportunity is nothing on new from the compression technique and whats required on the digital side would we love to see market continue to grow it over last year Absolutely more RD into it it’s not to make the market grow Now on the side to divide up the area around the base station we’re talking of macro based station now to divide up spatially you need to have more than one antenna to steer energy control more than one antenna you need product and where were pointed our revenue grew at the top of the list when you at her peer this yearonyear we’re positioned very well and growing very well also point out market declining double digit a so sound good had and you back over the last four year we’ve had quarter where it declined yearonyear described it a choppy might use the word lumpy mean the same to me it be a good market make good money in there but might provide some growth but not a significant growth Got it with we’re at the end of our you so much appreciate your insight everyone for joining u',\n",
       "       'you give u of an update on the launch of your new millimeter fab of the timing affect of were currently in a downturn have any effect on of the timing of when you need to ramp your new fab the timing of our next factory recently announced chosen the site obviously an important step in the process to build it next to our existing one of our existing millimeter fabs in Richardson fab when it equipped support above worth of revenue were to make the decision in the next of year to break ground If you of about what drive timing we finished last with about of open millimeter capacity is roughly a where were starting and have guided too growth would be tougher to by this if we grew at upper singledigits or low doubledigits say we have three four year before we have to have capacity on the because growing at those rate are unrealistic of what drive the next of year and certainly environment play a role in decision to followon from Seans point though the shell is to go up earlier so any timing on the shell when the shell you think… what we of describe the next or two is the long pull in the process cost u to when we break ground and it take u month may be two year somewhere in timeframe to complete the building indiscernible we had a here you done a great job in recent year in term of taking opportunity this to of build some smaller batch stuff long life stuff kit factory et cetera Is there anything we can do from the outside to understand of where we are in opportunity Is extend through the down cycle or of is out at some point how do we about if put it into context and we about our four competitive advantage and one of them is to reach the channel had team go off and try to figure out way to strengthen our relationship with our customer have a more direct closer relationship of those way is by owning and controlling our inventory in the channel it of an outcome of why we put in place consignment inventory and putting pressure on inventory up about twothirds of our revenue now supported by consignment a we complete this next phase well push somewhere near of our revenue on consignment Another element of is a you pointed out is during period of weaker demand we built low volume part we believe be longlived and were doing so our lead time and the availability of product is very high of throughout all the cycle the reason were doing it now Operationally allows u to run our factory a bit more stable than they otherwise would drive some other efficiency back the reason why were doing is to ensure they have very good customer service last we continue to make progress on it continue to make progress on it this and the consignment piece we take to the end of this before were completely done with the phase maybe next or the after it depends on how demand shape a we move through the back half of the more question right you would to ask you about the capital allocation a you the leverage low one of the lowest compared to the peer high single credit rating want to your thought is there where you see it an ideal you want to be is there any room flexibility you want to lever up if you see the right opportunity to make understand your is specifically in capital allocation and there is a room to lever up significantly yes it great about debt of it a a way to increase return for longterm owner were comfortable carrying debt because of our model a long a the economics make obviously we they make if looked we’ve taken a very cautious approach to debt and we don’t have any lurching move in it still even close to debt neutral would on our balance sheet we have more cash than we actually need to operate the and we certainly have a lot more capacity to take on debt if you at u in and and we do have a commitment to return all cash flow to our customer we returned a more than of our cash flow in the form of dividend and the balance went to share buyback in fact we bought back about of cash flow from our buyback some of came from reduction in cash some of it came from issuance of new debt again would back at history and wouldnt expect any lurching move on it but we are comfortable carrying debt cash flow per share growth over the year up in obviously a great track record here a normalized demand environment you’ve revenue growth you’ve margin expansion combined with your focus on share count reduction through share repurchase Should we continue to expect to grow it cash flow per share at a doubledigits CAGR how should we about it it a great the and most important we is growing the topline if the semiconductor industry grows maybe and for gaining share we can maybe add a point or two to growth comfortably get u mid singledigits and start to push into upper singledigits Every dollar come in we build on millimeter to give u a structurally lower cost accelerate cash flow by a point or two over a longer of then lastly be taxed on it way to cash flow if we Market continues to behave themselves and we can continue to buy share added another point or two to cash flow growth say comfortably you can get somewhere in the upper singledigits and maybe have shot at getting doubledigits when looking at five and year or longer growth then my last is last the team drove cash flow margin up from in the prior obviously increasing mix of revenue to millimeter is a big driver of leverage on the OpEx is another driver note given your scale your rule of thumb on OpEx is always been to of revenue seems a bit outdated because even here in the let assume were somewhere near the trough of the cycle your OpEx is still only of revenue a much bigger more scaled plan to tighten the on your OpEx view through cycle when we provide those number it a general way to of the model we allocate capital we talked a bit about how we do in RD of getting the dollar to the best place If we felt by increasing the number of product a an example we do if we went from to to to if would change the trajectory of the topline the cash to do it Same with investment and SGA with thing ticom and other initiative we have this consignment program so were not capital constrain but a owner of the we want to allocate capital efficiently again there is no limit to add but it a guideline not how we of when we allocate capital not taking a percent of revenue but an outcome and our focus remains a owner of the to grow cash flow per share a fast a possible over a long of if we’re able to do all of our owner be happy you very much Appreciate you joining u here this morning you',\n",
       "       'go to with of for taking my am of thinking how to interpret your outlook interpretation is you are not seeing much recovery off of right which is of surprising when we hear of China improving and all the optimism about some sign of recovery other interpretation is maybe you saw the extra benefit from comm equipment if exclude then you are seeing some modest pickup into am how are you thinking about your outlook versus seasonally which is supposed to be up would certainly can confirm the part of the in we did get a benefit from comms equipment in the number when we at our outlook and we put together again we base on the order we get from customer a well a the demand feed we get through our consignment program a a reminder about twothirds of our revenue come through those consignment program for OEMs we typically get six month of visibility and there is no inventory sits in front of u in manufacturing line it is one of the best signal we can get also would caution doesnt mean signal cant change very quickly how we are basing the guidance for the and leave further interpretation to you Do you have followup maybe if ask the in a different way Have you any pickup in order over the last few week versus let the few week of the would order behaved normally in the again twothirds of our revenue is coming through on consignment we get an order when product is due to ship and happens instantaneously order are le of the strongest signal we get versus those demand signal we get from order you we go to next please go next to with for me ask the question wondering if you can a bit about some of the utilization action you are taking much of a hit were they to the calendar margin guess more importantly it take for utilization action to go through the PL but have the utilization rate now bottomed and how do you about utilization relative to margin and throughout the remainder of the for the me try to frame for you a bit Over the last of quarter we have talked about how we are to decrease our wafer start to adjust to the expectation of revenue while at the same we are to increase the portion or a dedicate portion of those wafer to building our lowvolume industrial consignment or industrial buffer part and also the transition to consignment we did those thing and our operating plan did reduce and we did take a hit to margin in process and what you are seeing in our PL Now what would sort of take you back to is at it from a cash flow standpoint because ultimately what matter right What you are seeing from a utilization charge standpoint is a noncash expense the end of the day what we are focused on is allocating capital and allocating cash right by decreasing those wafer start what we did dedicating le cash to in fact leaving out more cash for the owner of the but generating enough inventory or the right amount of inventory to be for the revenue we want to meet in the future and also to build those buffer inventory stock so we are for future quarter and have the ability to meet customer expectation and customer satisfaction which ultimately is what we are trying to do with inventory so it help u position ourselves to meet those customer demand and help with our goal of continuing to grow the topline for a long to a number on if you at our cash flow is at the same we had last so it didnt change much Do you have a followon back to the revenue guidance for the calendar if you at how historically performed need to go back to to see a calendar down and sort of in the wake of the tech bubble Again am trying to get a of what you are seeing in the bottom up to potentially have a scenario when they are of down sequential revenue guess you mentioned in your comment the comms can be lumpy historically Is embedded in the guidance still good lumpiness or would you expect lumpiness in the comms would if you over and you this very well if you over year of the comms equipment market is lumpy lumpy because of the way operator put out tender and place the order and the OEMs our customer have to build to those history say you should be mindful of and doesnt make it a bad an attribute of it so in the would you we completed the of yearonyear decline for not likely cycle a we mentioned in the remark can last four or five quarter Sometimes they can be shorter and sometimes they can be longer than but we are two quarter into per our practice if there something significant or unusual on in our guidance either by endmarkets or a particular customer we would make those thing clear to help you understand it you go to the next please go next to with for taking my question Again want to push on the comm point a bit and embedded have diverged partially because of this If it wasnt for the upside on comm and do you it would be seeing similar yearoveryear trend without the strength in comm a well a in the embedded they would be much closer there are still some difference but directionally all the endmarkets are the same and they would maybe much closer from yearoveryear decline standpoint Do you have a followon do Again want to followup still on comm we are seeing very strong ups mean guess the part of it is sort of you mentioned this the upside versus guidance in the all comm the rest of the came in a expected guess secondly on how concerned are you whats the possibility the current strength we would see in comm is not actually matched and then ultimately worried about order pullforwards and most of the thing from some of the larger customer Like what are you seeing along those line around the sustainability of the upside we are seeing in comm now guess over the medium to long would the upside we saw almost all from comms the rest of the market and business if you looked at it from way performed about a we expected the comment on what the future of look would go back to the statement we made before and staring at history of market it tends to be choppy would we expect it to be choppy in the future would not a comment on or or the comment of looking at history market tends to be choppy you go to the next please go next to with for taking my is your factory loading go up in this versus last are they to be down am try to understand if you believe inventory are to be a source or use of cash this Last we characterized because it more relevant at the given the inflection point on our revenue Now the midpoint of our revenue is about the same a the it to not focus on and focus on the other thing we are more important longer which is our ability to continue to grow the topline a we focus on and embedded industrial automotive with a we focus on growing cash flow for the longterm a mentioned earlier and we mentioned during the call despite the drop in margin and the drop in utilization our cash flow on the month essentially unchanged from day a a percent of revenue it right speaks to the quality of the model topline can change quite a bit but if you at month cash flow it tends to be much more stable speaks to the quality of the model do have a follow on you in your script you may have misunderstood this but you regionally the trend were consistent except for communication equipment quite understand am hoping you can spell statement out for me you you can of the largest manufacturer of communication equipment we try not to go by customer of who those are there are only a of region in which they exist so you can imagine you can connect those two piece of information together hopefully help you go to the next please go next to with very much for taking the had a followup on the comm you talked about the being up yearoveryear What embedded in your original guide for the again overall our revenue came within the of our expected guidance in the upper half primarily because of the strength we saw in comms equipment Got it then a a quick followup for wanted to get an update on your thought on capital return stock is back up to now quite your week high but close should we about buyback versus dividend versus other us of cash you am happy to address me take everybody back to our capital management strategy the objective we about when it come to cash return our objective there is to return all cash flow to the owner of the via buyback and dividend we we recognize sometimes you strategically build cash sometimes you strategically drain cash right then you can actually return more than of cash flow a frankly we have done for the last few year on the two piece so dividend and buyback dividend the goal is to provide a sustainable and growing dividend and we target to be somewhere between to of cash flow the moment on the we are at then on the repurchase is the creative capture of future cash flow for the longterm owner essentially mean so me dive a deeper on repurchase because where your is use reasonable assumption not aggressive not conservative but reasonable assumption of our expected growth of cash flow per share for the for a long to and then based on we develop our assessment on valuation of intrinsic value of the then we compare to their market price and depending on the divergence of those we buy back a long a this is below their intrinsic and higher than market price we be buying back share and how much it depends on their divergence right you can see our history of the last yearandahalf or so mean we have been returning significantly more than of cash flow a we do assessment a long a the intrinsic value is higher than the market price we buy back share in the open market do you have a followup his followup go to the next please go next to with he muted your line is open heard the operator came on Anyway my is on trend over in China you comment on how the order trend have gone over there over the last three month Have you any stabilization then any word you can give u on distribution inventory a well would a we in the remark all the region performed similarly with the exception of comms equipment we talked about of our market were consistent this Distributor inventory were up a more than a day to a over fourandahalf week Do you have a followon do a bit of a longerterm break with indiscernible them on the call If we at your other revenue it a of sale now and the operating margin been sort of steadily trending down over the last few year and in the most recent it about below the corporate average why is operating margin so low Whats on there then why not start shutting down or ending life of those product of thing on Recently in this last we did have a decrease of within our DLP but a lot of due to this consignment transition we have talked about part of what drove the shortterm and also maybe some of what the margin issue you are attributing to would also you some of the acquisition charge for example restructuring charge all in other piece Remember especially on the acquisition charge noncash elsewhere represents cash went out the door about eight year you adjust for maybe give you a better picture lastly we do have the customized piece there of hundred still left per there and over the next two three four year trend to zero rest of the should be fairly steady and of other the other comment would make you can see the seasonality of calculator not only in the revenue but you can see it in the operating margin almost all of those revenue for back to school we see at the end of the and the beginning of obviously the expense for carry out throughout the whole always you see because revenue come in in short of the operating margin in those two quarter much nicer the last comment make and we of joke about we should have up with a more creative name for other other good stuff or something those business generate lot of cash for u they take a lot of resource to maintain them why they remain in the family with we have for one more go next to with had a on the genesis some of the inventory related weakness you are seeing saw last some of the tightness of thing doesnt sell MLCC capacitor and thing where the lead time inflated and clearly corrected now guess a you back on do you triggered inventory of component to get built where do you we are in sort of cycle playing it way through in term of shortage of other component cant control a you are describing it of what drive semiconductor cycle right if you of a customer wherever they are in the world and they start to get notified from their supplier and our peer their lead time are out even though ours arent out they may decide to proactively take their inventory position from six week to nine week over a day drive strength in the overall and day later they decide to go from nine week to week of inventory because thing they are getting even tighter then once they get comfortable it move back in the other way a you watch play out we had quarter of very strong growth Most of double most people when they looked at would describe a above trend and what follows quarter of running above trend is a few quarter run below you have followon guess you may have touched on this and missed it any change in your own lead time over the last three month Generally our lead time have stable Even through the of very strong demand our lead time had stable you can always find pocket a you can where we work with customer very aggressively to close another important metric we track is on delivery and those have very very high Other customer service metric very high meaning if someone and order product at lead are we shipping them to the commitment we have and those high through whole cycle some of the thing we are doing building inventory of low volume part during this peak of weaker demand we are doing to ensure we can continue to deliver product consistently to customer whats driving and the visibility we get through program consignment of a combination of those thing we are actually doing other thing around inventory position and order entry and we have summarized a the belief their strategic value in owning and controlling inventory and keeping it on our balance sheet with turn it over to to wrap thing up for u right me finish with a few comment on key item for you to remember a we mentioned last we stay focused on what make u stronger long and diligent in the short Second we remain focused on and embedded the best product and industrial and automotive the best market we continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning cash flow to the owner of the you and good night today you for your',\n",
       "       'take our from with of how are you managing your utilization in this downturn you are seeing you mentioned you have longlived part but how are you managing utilization are you making any distinction by the endmarket the part is into a part of should we continue to assume the same or so incremental margin fallthrough me answer the last one yes now me go back to your a there is a bit of an echo on the call but a a we talked a lot on the call day we have reduced our wafer start to align our operating plan better with our revenue expectation we did in and we are doing again in the drive lower factory loading and have a PL effect but the way were thinking about it is a an is from a cash standpoint inventory is a use of cash a we drive down inventory actually help cash more importantly it set u up to support our revenue expectation for the coming to revenue expectation those revenue expectation change overtime then well adjust the factory loading and utilization in order to manage appropriately Ill add to the part of your ten of thousand of product across customer so you can imagine the complexity of planning strongest signal we get is the order from customer a well a the demand signal we get through our consignment program a we go through and planned wafer start is what we pay close attention to obviously in a this well be very diligent in watching and then proactively moving when we need to with do you have a followup the part is you mentioned it hard to predict when we out of this downturn are there any other sign you at even if there are qualitative can give u some indication whether this is a one or two or three issue understand it very trade dependent but have you cancellation are any different or similar to prior downturn other color you could help you could give u to help u try and at least predict somewhat when we out of this would be very useful you so maybe a of thing when we at different thing we can at cancellation they were up in the but up a Lead time overall they continue to be stable can always find pocket where were working aggressively with customer to close but by and far they tend to be very stable well at all of those signal on the broader view Ive been in the industry for over year now and we looked at data over of and Ive been through up cycle and obviously were entering into the ninth down cycle if you stare at the data and Ive in your report done some analysis on too there is no typical or average to those number but if you had to pick a number it around the month a cycle could last thing trade tension could lengthen but it doesnt mean it to be long a you it could be longer or shorter than again the best signal we get is those order from customer you want to add to to add to we are proactively setting the operating plan so we can manage whatever come at u it at a if we can run sideways for a while we are to support our potential snapback if it deeper and longer then we have to make further adjustment but we are in a good position to make those adjustment and protect the cash flow and have the in a position move to with back to of utilization and inventory you in your comment youll be above sort of your inventory target for next several quarter of relative to how you see the world and what action already taken on utilization Do you day represent of the peak in inventory day or would you expect it to migrate to higher before migrating lower guess a you answer the if you could u with the consignment plan of what are the new target for inventory longer so a good me give you a few thing to about on a before at the end of the day our objective here is to maximize longterm growth of cash flow so how we about all these norm ph Loadings and inventory is one of them CapEx is another one all were doing is trying to maximize longterm growth inventory a we we see value in owning inventory part of the reason why we are building low volume those lowvolume buffer we talked about is also the reason why we are increasing the consignment inventory push put upward pressure on inventory the same we overall we have lowered the operating plan so is to control the cash used for inventory more or so than any particular inventory day target Now to get to the heart of your it depends right if this get weaker then inventory day could theoretically go up higher than If it stay above stable then over one two or three quarter well get back to the insider Then a a followup you talked about sort of there been time where discrepancy in growth between and Embedded wondering if you could help u understand of from an end market perspective where the discrepancy is sort of the largest example in the comm space there is a good content story on the side might not be there on the Embedded side when you at the difference of growth rate is there any sort of end market color you can give u and certainly both of those segment do have different end market exposure talked about the benefit is staying in comms equipment most of our PE revenue in is well so the difference we do have some of Embedded and if you at yearoveryear growth rate for a long a had the segment out there youll notice in time they are actually moving in opposite direction but overtime if you at those number they do perform more similar then also if you at industry data for the market and compare to the Embedded market those behave differently of the fact of how those two business behave you well go to the next please move next to with What the booktobill in the nearterm of looking at booking and the rolling forecast on your direct and consignment base customer have you any sign of stabilization or do the nearterm trend still suggests of continued weakness along the same sort of the slope our booktobill and always make this comment whenever it asked now of our revenue on some type of a consignment program so seeing number begin to move up a we implement further stage of our consignment program with distributor so booktobill is somewhat you have to be cautious with the number this it it a and in the last so what the fact are if you at thing order linearity order decreased each of the To some degree not completely unusual in a youd see weakness a you into the those order and the demand feed we get from our customer driven u to give you the guidance we have so where we are have a followon the growth this you drove another of revenue to your millimeter fabs about left to go if assume of highsingle digit type of normalized revenue growth for your millimeter fabs are to be full in about year it would seem the team would be having to make a decision soon about your new fab expansion initiative you have any update there me give you my view and then may go ahead and chime in capacity planning for new millimeter tranche of capacity something to take very seriously and something a very longterm horizon this is something is not changed by small fluctuation in shortterm expectation so we are continuing the planning process on and right now we have option to consider and well continue thinking of we have day whenever we do decide to go route if we do build our factory thatd be a to cost on the shell the actual building and spend over a of year not the only option we have for to expand capacity we can always buy an existing factory and another option were considering also would the if we do build a factory there are multiple location were considering add last we had about of our revenue on millimeter footprint up from about real close to what the actually grew again we plan to about a would grow it would be millimeter would support the growth roughly what again this take with of all congratulation on surviving downturn you about the ability to manage CapEx and OpEx this if this sluggish continues you work OpEx down on a yearoveryear then you CapEx of sale or something what should we be thinking about CapEx a a percent of sale this me give you some background there a mentioned earlier on the call all the knob we have at the end of the day are to optimize and maximize longterm growth of cash flow per share so the main objective a you very well from knowing u for many year and our capital management strategy CapEx is one of those knob and for CapEx specifically what is the objective it to invest and support in new technology development it revenue growth and to expand our lowcost manufacturing advantage in we spent for CapEx and a you pointed out of revenue the same we generated of cash flow growth on cash flow from the previous year despite CapEx we increased cash flow Now CapEx is positioning u to grow the top line and cash flow for a long to Now given a you pointed out and a our midpoint and our implies decelerating market then we can do thing differently on CapEx Going expect if condition continue a slowdown in CapEx not in the maybe not even in the but over keep in mind keep in mind is all dependent on expectation of growth beyond for year not or even well adjust those well adjust the CapEx plan a those expectation change add when you at wed expect CapEx to run into the future even beyond closer to of revenue higher than what it been in the because of the availability of use the millimeter equipment on the market so where our expectation there are have a followon you about how the slowdown is impacting your two biggest end market industrial and automotive when we at them they both slowed in the actually saw industrial it broadbased growth on from a yearonyear it double digit but of the it actually grew upper single digit then automotive again it had slowed but it grew double digit in total for the but for the for yearonyear it grew in lowsingle digit again both of those market are growing but certainly not at the rate we have over the few year you well go to our next please you be from ph from can you give u an idea of OpEx for it typically up seasonally but it also a more fixed now than in the is it to be up a smidge ph both yearoveryear and on a quarterly so Ill go ahead and take step back real quick OpEx is another knob we have to optimize longterm growth of cash flow per share right at the end of the day is the longterm objective in the case of OpEx it an opportunity to invest in RD so to put more product for industrial and automotive is an opportunity to invest in demand creation on the SGA side and other thing other initiative to strengthen our competitive advantage If you at OpEx came in at about growth versus the previous and of revenue a goforward for for dollar of OpEx would expect somewhere in the neighborhood maybe up a of percentage point for pay and benefit increase something along those line generally speaking at about same all OpEx Now you asked specifically about the we give you a for revenue a for EPS we get in the line between but tell you were not expecting anything unusual can at the fallthrough expected fallthrough on revenue to GPM ph and do your own model and you should get to a reasonable assumption or conclusion for those line in between Do you have a followon do actually the Repo ph the biggest in a a percent of cash flow thinking about year you of it way on of a quarterly but it historically been a more mechanical than opportunistic should we of read into you were a more opportunistic because of the stock pullback for the again me step back and everybody whats our intent when it come to repurchase and our intent is to return all cash flow to the owner of the and objective not changed do through a combination of dividend and buyback and we be we have been and be opportunistic with repurchase a it make for example in a mentioned earlier our cash flow an increase of from the previous wed return throughout the through a combination of dividend and buyback yearonyear cash flow growth the biggest driver of increase in return a a increase from in the previous great go to the next please be from ph with wondered if you can about geographic difference you mentioned China in your opening remark and obvious right now what did you see there and contrast with what you saw in the and Europe weak also perhaps not a weak a China exactly right when we looked at China it weaker than the other region then when you drop down into the end market within China described it a performing very similarly directionally meaning comms equipment up a it in other area we saw the market of auto and industrial a well a enterprise get weaker from standpoint so we did see difference this have a followon guess you would also mentioned in your remark the impact of the trade issue and tariff obviously it very hard to disassociate from whats on in the end market with have you also guess heard this from some others perhaps there some activity of either pulling order to get ahead of tariff or pushing out thing because of the tariff and obviously the deadline have changed and another deadline coming up guess the is what effect it may have had on order pattern a we went through the it hard for u to actually distinguish specifically the one we did see distributor did get more cautious on their inventory late in the mentioned in the remark of coupled with the sign of weakness we saw in China led u to the belief part of the caution they are seeing from a trade tension standpoint you and well go to the next please you be from with is Jerry ph on behalf of have a quick on you mentioned consignment transition is there could you quantify an impact to the guide and a a whole ph we saw about impact in the the you can me it about or million… in the the of Wed expect a we go through next impacted to be about in by the end of the we should have next phase fully deployed have a followon there been some question about end market want to ask in a different way you about quarteronquarter what the end market did specifically focusing on the Certainly industrial declined upper single digit those decline were broadbased Automotive declined upper single digit with all sector decreasing personal electronics declined low double digit comms equipment grew single digit and enterprise system declined with we have for one more be from ph with Capital guess two question from me a well mean off when at the guide and the implication is revenue decline from in yearoveryear to about in What is driving acceleration in revenue decline Is there a of end market you would specifically call out driving it where perhaps the challenge adjusting ph aggressively or is it more or le broadbased when we give our guidance we do it by end market unless there is something is on of would be discontinuous with how thing are operating well finish up the and it provide the detail by end market then clearly the weakness we saw in the continued into the were continuing to expect to continue into to add to a in remark and during the call we this weakness is primarily due to the semiconductor cycle grown for in a row ph and the sort of happens in the semiconductor industry in addition to the macro environment including the trade tension could also be having an impact and could affect and the duration of indiscernible have a followon do the best you have talked about your ability to keep picking up to point a share across your end market you at where revenue or broader industry trend are somewhat more challenging is it easier for larger to pick up more market share or is it more difficult for you would you of stack up when you at the quality of the opportunity in the and Embedded space if market share doesnt move quickly across any of our peer in these marketplace and speaks to the quality of opportunity we continue to invest in our competitive advantage which are our manufacturing and technology we talked about earlier the breadth of our product portfolio the reach of our market channel which includes our sale force and the size of it but also our presence at TIcom and then diversity and longevity were not dependent on any particular customer or product or technology to drive revenue were working and investing to make those stronger it hard to pick up market share can tell you everyone here at be focused on even a we go through the downturn and have even more diligence and intensity around overall again if you could make number higher we absolutely would but it is a hard to move with me turn it over to to add some final comment right me finish with a few comment on some key item for you to remember during this of weaker demand we stay focused on what make u stronger longterm and diligent in the shortterm Second we remain focused on the and Embedded the best product and Industrial and Automotive the best market we continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy and remain committed to returning all cash flow to the owner of the you for joining u Again please plan to join u for our Capital call on at Central Time of this call is on our our call for everyone you all for your may now your line',\n",
       "       'indiscernible the the on the call we werent of regional weakness but since gone on it look China weakened when were asked the what we do is we at the data from our sale and where were shipping product usually make a comment a very bad proxy for whats on in a region Every once in a while it strong enough it pop out but we may ship a product and use we may ship a product to an auto tier in Indiana then get put into a BMW in Germany then get put on a ship and sold in to Beijing you have a slowdown in Beijing show up in our order book a a slowdown in Indiana we have a way to track where revenue go and a a lot of the revenue we ship into China end up shipping into other region around the world what can tell you a when we looked at the data last there not a region jumped out read the same headline in report you do a slowing in China Is in the order book Absolutely won’t escape either right but what we can see directly is what we about had a on your new inch fab Do you have a timing for when you expect to ramp fab up when you at the profitability how do you see the greenfield capacity margin versus existing also do you expect a it take to get up to scale where we could get le incremental margin than in the few year me take the shot and a multi question forget some of them but at a high we do or so dollar of revenue this and our overall capacity if you at what we on millimeter specifically you should up with about or so leaf almost with the existing infrastructure we can continue growing Now if you didnt take the and project it at some point we run out of capacity right and could be depending on what assumption you make between we’ve used to If you do we run out in the back half of we run out in either way at some point we run out we have been and continue to for option to increase capacity and this is specifically millimeter wafer capacity which is significantly le expensive le expensive than millimeter we it a competitive advantage have multiple option to do still looking at potentially buying an existing factory and have been but another one is to build a new factory could be in various state in the United States or it could be outside of the United States and were looking at and well give you whatever were ready we about Now me tell you some specific on factory if we do build a new factory you don’t build half a factory or a of factory we have to build the whole right the entire building would be one of discrete expense to be to over a of year because you obviously don’t build it in one take about a and a half or so to build be a discrete expense on and then after you still have equipment more incrementally is always ahead of demand but incrementally Now you asked about the return is how we to about it factory it cost all in building and equipment to some of depends if you buy the factory from somebody else and you have to equip it or you build a building and you have to put most of equipment new so would be on the the previous case on the side once is fully equipped can generate of revenue per for to year at plus of fall through of cash fall through margin right Do the math on is a huge return whether you put or on the spreadsheet on the investment you’re still to get a good return is the power of millimeter for specifically because the digital would be a very different story because you wouldn’t be able to run it for to year but the factor you can run it long and get a good return and it about this last on a call you of caused a bit of controversy around dividend versus buyback and you of left the impression perhaps you get more back in dividend than buy back and then you spent the next of quarter actually buying back more stock then the trend over the last few quarter you about excess cash can you about dividend versus buyback and maybe also throw in the MA card the frequency of MA been about every to year so it’s hard to draw a trend with frequency but were coming up to to on returning cash to investor so we believe before generating cash flow is the most important maybe the most important is returning to the owner of the and we do through dividend and buyback the dividend to of the cash flow is our target sustainable on the were up or plenty of room on front downside of the remaining is buyback for example over the last month we have generated of cash flow and we have returned through dividend and buyback about the same and some people at our buyback in isolation and wow increased it but the cash flow is what increased to begin with at the highest the strategy we do a live in more during time where the stock price is depressed can do have done and we’ll do that’s created through the of the MA tell you a few thing our high framework is we only at company have catalog product are focused on industrial and automotive and with differentiated product and only when the price is right the symbol framework it to pay and the price being right it mean if spend on day one within year better be getting my cost of capital from a cash flow standpoint in my cost of capital call it for simplicity by four need to be getting after tax cash of per every right and then growing a difficult hurdle to achieve lady and gentleman we don’t do it very often but good for you a owner of the because we’re not expanding your capital other to consider with MA is at the or frankly for a number of year since we bought national we have a gap in our portfolio this is not were not out there desperately looking for a match in order to fill some big gap in the portfolio consider niche thing here and there augment but nothing would meet of the strategic portfolio gap definition ended our here but want to both and for joining u Appreciate you you',\n",
       "       'you come from with you for taking my question wanted to ask about driver of margin in the next mentioned a few thing you’re to reduce wafer start but inventory day are also to rise mentioned your millimeter next phase is coming on which suggests CapEx continues to be elevated so depreciation go up wondered if you could give u a bit more color on the different driver a we get into and how should about those driver evolving into and beyond a some of them are longerterm me take big picture of fallthrough on our revenue is the same a it been before to is what we have talked about and applies on up it also applies down that’s what we would expect Of course is over the long haul any one it could be a different other would tell you obviously when we are increasing wafer start is a help for margin and when we’re decreasing wafer start it’s a headwind on margin so you see and you should expect have a followup guess how do you continue to build inventory if you’re reducing wafer start work it depends on how much you reduce wafer start depending on the revenue change right also it depends on the timing of Wafers cycle time can be anywhere between to week doesn’t change on a dime the key point on keeping those the wafer start at a even though we are reducing them but we can still build those longlived inventory buffer for industrial and automotive Those are low risk buffer Those part live for a long long and they enable u to then support our customer on the other side of this slowdown overall it’s a better way and a smart way to allocate our capital add to not only we build strategic inventory of lowvolume part but we’re also a we talked about in the remark moving a larger proportion of our revenue to consignment both of those thing put pressure on inventory we believe those are the right thing to do long go to the next please now hear from with afternoon for me ask a relative to your comment in the remark about Embedded in the comms space can you help u sort of quantify the size of now is at all influencing the guide for the yes me take you back to our capital management strategy back in if you back even over the few year we’ve been talking about how we’re allocating RD through an end market view a you walk through no surprise industrial and automotive we’ve been taking our allocation of RD up there Personal electronics no surprise there down but it’s more selective it’s not zero still find good opportunity then comms equipment been a different story on than it been on Embedded we’ve long talked about in Embedded we’ve taken our spend there up and Embedded we’ve actually taken it down reason why is when you at there are what’s new and what operator need and the OEMs are delivering new standard creates more complexity in the radio for u translates to more content and more opportunity new standard don’t change thing much from a digital standpoint we’ve good position there that’s not isn’t something we’ve needed to invest in what we are seeing is the result a roll out we’re confident in our position a market begin to grow we also have a great and we’re still shipping some stuff we are convinced the majority of our growth is still to longerterm from industrial and automotive we’ll comms equipment be a very good market for u for long period of Do you have a followup guess my specifically is is there another shortfall in revenue coming in Embedded Comms in the calendar it look it at least on a yearoveryear about in the calendar if your comment about Embedded growing ex comms is correct if doing the math right Is is there more to in the calendar is this now behind u last comms equipment of our revenue in total would if you have listened to the commentary which you did it the one market actually grew of the right we saw yearonyear growth in communication equipment in total even though not contributed by the Embedded yes those thing are in our guidance our guidance is more influenced by the fact we are seeing most of the market beginning to slow versus the specific of what’s on of comms equipment you go the next please you with please go ahead a more color maybe on the slowdown you to your customer or the distis it feel thing could get a bit worse then maybe which it sound comms look a bit better which of the end market fallen off the most me start and see if want to add anything it’s always best when you enter a this of stick to the fact of what we can see what we can measure turned in growth yearoveryear If you take the midpoint of our guidance revenue would be flat that’s a different number than what we’ve delivered of this where it go from there and how long it last are thing we don’t be in a position with what we’re doing with wafer start if it’s a more shallow correction we be to support it on the other side If it’s longer lived we be monitoring our wafer start on a daily and we how to react in those situation me add to and frankly emphasize what he covered it very well already most end market have slowed that’s what we we believe this is mostly driven by a slowdown in semiconductor meaning we can’t speak to any macro driven event here we have before the direct effect of the tariff for u in any of the trade issue is minimal not there all we can judge is by what we see right in front of u what our customer the signal they send u and that’s what we are basing this on addition to a the key here is what we do with the operating plan so we put ourselves in a position so if this is shallow we can very quickly ramp back up and support growth If it’s not shallow if it actually go the other way we are also in a position where we can make additional adjustment to continue to do the right from a cash flow standpoint and from an operating plan standpoint the investment side a during our remark we are not to change anything on RD SGA be prudent and then on millimeter we’re to continue with the plan to continue expanding strengthening the competitive advantage Do you have a followon guess not talking about the future but given what’s happened to you up until now What would you attribute the cause of the slowdown Is it overall demand Is it tariff Is it China Is it too much inventory Anything more on the slowdown in semi What do the customer or disties are telling you guess of reiterating what and maybe add a color is we believe that’s mostly driven by a slowdown in the semiconductor market after several year of strong growth doesn’t preclude there aren’t other thing and other factor the macro thing are on Certainly a the quarter evolve those thing become more obvious of what role they’ll play that’s where we’ll stick to what we can see and what we all right you we’ll go to the next Caller your line is open with to me ask a guess wanted to hit it from a lead perspective doesn’t seem you’re to give terribly more color on it if it’s short lead time and your lead time haven’t changed it seems it would be more of a demand than an inventory perspective any color you could give on then maybe even geographically is there any color about one market acting differently than any of the others me comment on a few of the thing we can see certainly we watch all those indicator to of start with where want to end is the best indicator we get are order from customer we get directly a well a we’ve of our revenue on consignment where we actually have demand fee customer are telling u what they plan to build those clearly are the best signal we can see outlook be built on certainly those indicator show demand slowed across most of the end market during the that’s why you see the guidance a it is the sentiment of a we are working through thing here when you at the other indicator we see so thing distributor inventory it’s up slightly but it’s still running at about four week Cancellations are up but would still describe them a running at low level lead time a you mentioned they have continued to remain stable it doesn’t matter what you’re in you’re always to have place where demand be tight and we work with customer on the majority of product have continued to be very very stable from a lead standpoint that’s of what we see Regionally don’t when we at our number there’s nothing there we would call out specifically also a a reminder you very well we ship product into a particular region it may get put into a subsystem or a system and then shipped into another region of the world actually looking at our demand by regional result doesn’t give much color on what’s on from a macro standpoint you a followon quickly you haven’t mentioned the automotive market in any shortterm fashion that’s been the market the biggest laundry list of headwind from your customer and your customers’ customer color of what you’re seeing in aggregate or on the five sub segment within it Automotive growth did slow there a you we’ve been growing very strongly and for five year plus demand slowed but it still grew doubledigits right we saw growth broadbased across the sector in aggregate it did slow a well a the demand of industrial so you go to the next please with please go ahead you wonder if you can take one more cut at this demand mean when you are guiding for is the conservatism entirely what you’re seeing in your order book to what degree when you see these automotive shortfall at your customer and to a lesser extent industrial shortfall of your customer are you budgeting for to maybe soften from where your current of visibility is is not the way you’re looking at make a quick comment and turn it over to wouldn’t categorize or characterize guidance a conservative is the best we based on the order we are getting from our customer and the best signal we have encompasses the best of our knowledge that’s well Do you have a followon mean do you have a for when you at your do you your customer built inventory did you see any people building ahead to get ahead of tariff either the or the tariff any indication your inventory may have built and some element of this is softening Is inventory declining in how are you thinking about those inventory level point out or you because you we’ve of our revenue on consignment for revenue there isn’t an inventory buffer at our customer are in front of demand we’re seeing is the actual is close to the factory order build a you’re to get visibility end there right their demand downstream and downstream into their kennel of course we have no visibility on front we are fairly early in the announcement schedule and lineup so we find out where if there is inventory out there a more company report you very much we’ll go to the next please go to with of sorry with Lastly check to you Never Never is there on the line a well sorry You’re safe buddy on the demand side wanted to you have been to several sector wanted to make and you’re correctly calling out you’re telling u what you’re seeing on the fact space then these metric cancellation or debookings or what have you is there a rate of change you at and you can give u any perspective on how deep it’s to be or what of duration this would turn into take a shot at you want to add to frankly no we a we have the visibility we have is to the consignment inventory that’s in front of u by the way is inventory is still in our book we haven’t recognized revenue for that’s one advantage of having consignment inventory so that’s the data point we have and we use to forecast the next quarter’s revenue the other data point is what already mentioned right cancellation They’re up slightly but they continue at low level and our lead time have stable thing distributor inventory point out it’s still around four week That’s half to a of what many of our peer run with distributor inventory a we implement these next phase number structurally continue to down over now doesn’t mean we’re not to see cycle in those type of impact even with consignment inventory we have a good a visibility a you can get of what our customer are to build never confuse high visibility with number can’t change and change quickly but we about it a soon the customer plan to do something and something different me add a bit to next phase of consignment we talked about a mentioned that’s to take those distribution inventory week from about four to maybe about three over the next or so did put some headwind on our revenue of about it is to put it is putting another or so to our revenue is incorporated of course in our guide Of course is a small part of what’s on here we’ve most of our market have slowed down and that’s the main driver of the guidance we’re giving Do you have a followon did and helpful What the booktobill for the booktobill knew you would ask is in the a always give number have to for those who don’t follow u and about the consignment program we don’t carry any order for demand so booktobill be careful with the number use it in the safety of your home with we’ll move onto next please go to with of you Are you still there still here when at the last two downturn you went through and focusing on the core and Embedded and talking about the half of or late they of lasted for two quarter and then you saw your core and Embedded start to then start to grow yearonyear you don’t want to anything about the future if you were to help u contrast the customer behavior and the signal you’re seeing now versus what you saw in those downturn is there anything stand out positive or negative I’d start a we at those and we all at industry data we went through those other downturn the ups weren’t very strong and therefore the down weren’t very strong right we’ve described those a we’ve moved through them operating in a world have low economic growth right the last of year certainly we’ve had much stronger upturn in the economy overall economic growth been stronger over the last of year that’s certainly different our continued to evolve have more industrial more automotive are continuing to invest and ensure revenue is coming from diverse and longlived place we’ve continued to invest in our millimeter footprint and grow we’ve into the number and if you at the financial performance of the over those last cycle and even this and you at the amount of cash flow we’re generating we turned in a a percentage of revenue Those are good strong number those are the thing give u confidence to continue to make the investment to make the stronger investing in the competitive advantage strengthen and weaken over period of we continue to stay focused on our opportunity me comment on yes to Dave’s point we have demonstrated for a number of year now the strength of the model that’s through ups and now down the right to do what we continue to have done and what we continue to do is continue to strengthen our competitive advantage so we continue to become stronger of the thing or one of the competitive advantage a you is our manufacturing technology specifically millimeter a mentioned in my remark we are looking at the next tranche of capacity we are exploring option for our next millimeter factory we’ll likely make a decision within the next or so this slowdown is not to stop u from putting in place Now we’ll do it smartly and the you have to do when building a factory we can still buy a factory when we are building a factory it would be to build the shell the actual building and then we can decide on equipment more incrementally beyond to give you some thing to about on front our CapEx a we do our CapEx increase to about of revenue fact it’s already there the last month we were at then is excluding the factory shell talked about when we went on building a factory it be about CapEx a a percent of revenue plus the shell and shell be to over a of year want you to consider and about be that’s how we are looking at it and how we are planning the next tranche of capacity Do you have another for information next is on buyback bought back right You’ve been very active in buyback with the month you still have believe you left stock is down from it high Is it fair to assume you can be more aggressive on buyback to take advantage of the stock price in general how do you about when to be more aggressive with your buyback you me take a step back what is the objective here the objective to return all cash flow to the owner of the the last month we generated of cash flow then we returned we’ve returned virtually the same we have generated that’s consistent with what we’ve done for a number of year we continue to do we on the margin do a bit more here and there could and but the big picture is we would return all cash flow to the owner of the you very much we have for one more you go to with you congratulation on operating margin that’s impressive your SGA down quite a bit now below Is to be sort of the rate we should consider of already incorporate you managing the OpEx a bit more conservatively What would tell you we of OpEx in general not SGA but OpEx and SGA and RD a investment Not everything there but certainly all of RD is an investment and part of SGA that’s part of SGA is to drive growth in revenue and cash flow over the longterm that’s how we view suggest you also at it way and then it’s easier to then at it on a get some of the quartertoquarter transition out of the way can be a noisy on OpEx is up about versus the same last or last sorry is a good expectation of how number should trail other would point to is SGA in particular in down in part because of our transition Do you have a followup that’s very helpful followup is on inventory day completely get it and understand the new consignment plan how high are you willing to the inventory day go given the structural change don’t want to get into specific frame it this way a it likely go above the right now the is to it likely go above owner to me to u is a use of cash right feel compelled to use cash for inventory because it’s a good return on investment because it’s to help u on the other side of our recovery a it’s a very low obsolescence type of inventory we wouldn’t keep it at those level indefinitely If it’s a long lasting slowdown then we would take additional measure to modulate inventory bring it back within the at some point in the future you very much appreciate all of you joining u tonight of this call is on our night you Ladies and gentleman again concludes today’s you all again for your may now',\n",
       "       'you well take our from from you on the solid result my is on the high volume in your comment you had mentioned that’s declined yearoveryear in the of to what extent by choice a you pruned the portfolio to what extent do you a handset phenomenon a it build last for product cycle more robust than this to what extent do you feel might be a leading indicator for maybe some excess in the “cycle” for asking what were seeing there is a result of how been allocating our resource in RD if you remember back in in our Capital Calls we went through a disciplined process essentially what were trying to do is steer more money to longlived revenue opportunity where some of differentiation and well have for some you when you at the result overall revenue grew yearoveryear That’s inclusive of what happened of high volume again a result of allocating resource to the best sustainable opportunity If you drop down into there in the comment obviously industrial and automotive continue to do well Inside of HVAL you would see industrial and automotive did well a well doesnt make up a much of a percentage of revenue anyway were pleased with outcome and not surprised by it Do you have a followon and then a my followon it better to at the trend on a yearoveryear rather than sequential and on a yearoveryear you showed good operating margin leverage in the embedded it flat on op revenue and there still gap between embedded op margin and op margin do you about the leverage in the embedded market from here we ever close gap between embedded and me step back and take you back to our capital management strategy and some of the thing we there and how we about driving value for owner of the to u it all come down to growing cash flow per share it not operating margin it’s not margin it not versus embedded it all about growing cash flow per share Both of those business are and we expect to continue to be contributor to cash flow per share the focus is growing the topline we continue to invest in what we are the best market the industrial and automotive and in the case of a we continue to expand our millimeter footprint where we have a structural cost advantage now we’ll go to the next please we have from you very much had a on the guidance number were a bit below seasonal and seasonal is hard to figure out whats actually normal of coming off more difficult comp if at the guidance it a few hundred point below seasonal and it up point yearoveryear which is you the lowest in a of year Is there any element of more difficult comp or is there in fact some of channel inventory headwind you when we put together our guidance the two strongest signal we see are order we get from customer a well a the demand fee we get through our consignment program would if there is something to call out a we have in the if there a customer or end market or something changing we would you about a example lead time remain stable cancellation remain low reschedules remain low at inventory and the channel and steady at about four week we see any change from standpoint the other a you pointed out when you at a of data point it hard to describe what is exactly seasonal so if you over the last five year had a sequential growth Three of those five year been at if you over a ten it certainly our guidance from a seasonal standpoint is certainly within the of thing in the Do you have a follow on and then guess a a quick follow on can you give what order and book to bill were can give me find it so order book to bill order were up book to bill Ill point out it a and last always feel the need to comment on book to bill with about of our revenue through consignment program where we get any order in advance of pull from demand the book to bill isnt a strong of a signal or is at least a clear of a signal a what it used to be in the you well go to the next please well take our next from from me ask you a want to ask about from not necessarily a cyclical point of view but from a macro point of view all the discussion of trade war tariff et cetera you havent called out seeing anything further your answer to the last but how in general about dynamic a potentially impacting your are you in fact seeing any impact a of yet go ahead and take me take longterm support of trade and strong IP protection those are both important to and the broader ST industry we continue we feel way have stated we had been in position for a long and we continue to do and advocate on the tariff have been announced on integrated circuit those are still subject to public comment through the end of so those are not in place yet If once they go into effect or if they go into effect remember they apply to good are deemed of Chinese origin are then imported into the United States only about of our revenue is imported into the United States other word of our revenue is export so not subject to tariff only a sliver of Chinese origin a a would be deemed a Chinese origin bottom line only about of our revenue would have those tariff applied to it before we make any potential any adjustment supply chain and other thing we could do to even minimize impact further at the end of the day we see a major event or any direct impact other than some minimal impact Now not to at a macro could have an impact but a very macro comment go beyond and beyond the semiconductor industry trade anything against trade between the two largest economy in the world could eventually have a macro effect would be detrimental to everybody Do you have follow on do switching back to your product segment it seemed much in line what for the last few year but Embedded lower and Other much higher than what you of thing yearoveryear but if we at it is there any reason behind the Embedded being lower and the Other being so much higher if you at Embedded it a higher percentage of comms equipment it impacted by then in Other forget strong seasonality in and you for those question we go to the next please have our next from from Capital a lot guess two question for me a well off could you quantify the revenue impact you had from not your word mine but product rationalization or product optimization you went through in the revenue headwind if you may flow into the a well to some degree can you clarify what you mean by product rationalization when you talked about the consumercentric market you talked about how some of the revenue decline there were driven by the fact you decided not to participate in some of these market a reflection of how your RD budget are tracked over Is fair if so guess how much revenue impact driven by if you and we shared this back in on our Capital we looked at allocating resource across end market and specifically in personal electronics when you compare our spend there versus five and ten year it lower Now it not zero Theres still good opportunity we find of personal electronics and continue to invest looking for sustainable growth opportunity of space what were talking about again the came in specifically about one of the business of our you have to judge the efficiency of our capital allocation by the total result were quite pleased with help to answer your helpful guess if could followup you have had multiple quarter of margin expansion very consistent on a yearoveryear you about the back half of can you maybe about what are the lever could enable margin to continue to expand from here do you feel comfortable margin should expand in the back half go ahead and take we have talked about in Capital and in other setting our focus for value creation for the owner of the is cash flow per share not margin not operating margin dollar of cash flow per share the opportunity for expanding and continuing to grow are simple the top line a we continue to invest in the best product and the best market and the best market because where the semiconductor content is expanding and we continue to gain share there then millimeter have talked about for a number of year of last about of our revenue went through millimeter four out of ten in the space leaf a lot of room for continued expansion on millimeter and continuing to grow cash flow per share you we go the next please take our next from from good afternoon Solid job on the quarterly and strong cash flow generation focused market automotive subsegments Industrial subsegments you give u a on the breadth of the yearoveryear growth in these market a majority of these subsegments up yearoveryear color here would be helpful when you at growth were pleased with it very broad based when you at all of the sector out of the combined we had of them actually grew it’s very broadbased when you across different product different investment and we at our designins in our pipeline those continue to be very broadbased give u confidence in the sustainability of growth of course it doesnt mean we wont see cyclical headwind at some point when you at it from a five and ten standpoint we feel good about the progress we have made Do you have followon for the insight there so of to followup on maybe from a geographical perspective right last all region and this is ship to right is ship to data but still nevertheless important but last all region were up except for Japan What did you see this is the same story my friend in Japan Ive talked to them a of time Theyre give them a shoutout to them the revenue is down but when you at some reporting tool allow u to through what we call channel independent reporting a you mentioned it a ship to theyre continuing to make progress with the customer there a lot of revenue end up shipping either somewhere in Asia or it ship in Europe or in the even though it designed in there but the actual measurement we have is the shipping label on the box unfortunately theyre still called out on the call which theyre not happy about you we go to the next please we take our next from bank of from of for taking my and congratulation on the good the one your CapEx is now it over in four quarter it Depreciation is now below CapEx where are all these incremental investment what is the right longterm model we should assume for CapEx and depreciation me take me step back to you what the objective is right for CapEx to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically to extend our lowcost manufacturing advantage including millimeter which maximizes our opportunity to grow cash flow per share for the longterm the percent of revenue is an interesting metric to have in mind but the real driver is longterm growth of cash flow per share we have been and in period of sustained strong demand CapEx tends to go up and part of what seeing CapEx is to is primarily to support millimeter are other thing Theres assembly test Theres even other factory where we invest some of CapEx but predominantly it to continue to expand footprint of millimeter within our fab and building cost at the existing factory you go to the next want to go ahead and make a point on cash flow on our cash flow growth the month cash flow grew from about to a increase what would drew what drove and foremost our profit before tax grew about in comparison is higher revenue more revenue driven by industrial and automotive which again drove the majority of the revenue growth and more millimeter which to the earlier continues to help with the expansion of cash flow then and obviously tax reform in the United States we had a we have tax reform and a we have talked about did lower our tax rate in versus the previous in a significant way Additionally we had about of yeartodate of onetime tax related benefit are also associated with tax reform also played a factor in comparison so with do you have a followup Beyond the trade issue there been of shortage of passive component you supply but your other peer do have you your customer behave in a different way stock up stock down on various thing might impact your trajectory because your customer might be short of other component to help complete their system onething we have spend a lot of trying to do and remain focused on is keeping lead stable for the majority of our product they continue to remain stable doesnt mean we have hotspot and of course well work with customer to close those gap a aggressively a we can the other important metric we in of is ontime shipping performance a stated lead and if not shipping of customer tend to get nervous continued to remain at very very high level we cant see any bottleneck from customer not being able to get product from other place show up in the order book specifically it be there certainly could be but it not something we would have visibility into if we remain focused on what we can control which is the lead time and shipping performance customer can have confidence in getting product from u we go to the next please we take our next from from for taking my question one is ask about the nearterm OpEx trajectory Normally in youd be down a bit Is there any driver or anything could be on would make thing into this different than what we might ordinarily have given guess some of the historical trend leading into this a you we give revenue guidance and EPS guidance and stop it at unless there were any unusual trend and if so right between the line and if so we would point out not pointing out because there nothing unusual you should expect our usual trend within reasonable range Do you have followon do you There’s earlier on CapEx we it elevated now because you are out looking for other asset the same obviously a you continue to grow filling out millimeter and a margin benefit Do you over the benefit from increasing penetration of millimeter more than offset the depreciation expense on your margin so the way to at this is from a cash standpoint of investment a cash flowing out the cell on your spreadsheet and then after is return about it for those purpose from a depreciation standpoint a we continue to invest on we is those are very good longterm investment last for a long we put any of these tool in place and the cash fallthrough on those investment is high you very much we have for one more we have one more from from you some of your personal electronics market were up and some were down you give me a bit more color on which smartphones in particular grew in a smartphones continue to grow into won’t go into of detail did want to give some color on what on of personal electronics we see we saw multiple sector growing of there had some customer were growing but also wanted to point out not all customer were growing what we saw what illustrates is the power of having a diverse product portfolio and being able to sell to multiple customer of to my point earlier we at the opportunity of personal electronics Longer we see a a significant growth engine for u but it is a place we continue to invest and we believe the majority of the growth is to from industrial and automotive incrementally a taken up our spend moved it more into those growth area but again were to have handset and PCs and those other thing for decade to we find good opportunity of there and want to continue to invest in them Do you have followon for the color there term of longerterm on communication infrastructure obviously it been soft for everyone in the last few quarter do you about the opportunity the comment made now and repeatedly the investment area are industrial and automotive Do you there an opportunity around you need to invest in to help u understand how affect yeah so again would refer back to our capital management presentation a we walked through thinking remains consistent with from a comms equipment standpoint would our investment have shifted over If you at the standard and the thing needed to support the new thing new frequency being added thing the massive MIMO antenna are in for beamforming and other thing is all complexity you find in the radio itself for u translates into product to be able to support our spend in is up for supporting transition been for some when we at our spend versus and year at the same same change in standard and mix doesnt impact the digital side our spend actually is down on again describe our growth primarily coming from industrial and automotive a we over the next decade where tried to increase spending but we shift spending around to take advantage of thing in general very confident in our position were building off of a great position of a well were very pleased with those investment the last call Correct so before we close want to make a point because it wasnt asked but our result among other thing demonstrate our continued discipline and on capital management strategy generated on a of cash flow and we would return of cash flow in timeframe virtually all cash flow generated returned to the owner of the both through dividend and buyback the case of dividend on comparison it of cash flow right between and guidance but clearly towards the lower end so underscore the sustainability of those dividend you and you all for joining u of this call be on our concludes today you for your may now',\n",
       "       'go to with of for taking my and congratulation on the strong result and consistent my since you have such a wide perspective on the global economy wondering if you could give u a on what you are seeing versus for example what you might have thought at the start of the Are you noticing any area of slow down or pause or anything because your result are very strong is above consensus expectation perhaps it not what it been in the broadly what seeing in the economy versus what you thought three month me start with and then you want to chime in on tell you from a global standpoint but were seeing a very continued the macro economy continues to be constructive although uncertainty have been introduced clearly with the in the geopolitical area everything on we read in the news Now it too soon is what impact is to be on the macro whats important though on a from a we continue to see strength in industrial and automotive a highlighted in his remark Personal electronics grew across several sector and while communication equipment declined it above reasonable when you at the with revenue increasing the demand continuing to remain strong in both industrial and automotive and described demand is continuing to be very broadbased speaks to you of our competitive advantage which is diversity and longevity of product so were certainly benefiting from Do you have a follow on CapEx it up on a running ahead of revenue growth closer to or up there versus the target why is CapEx growing so much faster when only utilized in your millimeter factory mean should we at growing CapEx a a sign of confidence in demand or at what point should we be worried maybe you are to buy too much inventory give you a few a few thing on most importantly let step back and about what is the purpose of CapEx talked about this during our capital management strategy a of month CapEx our objective there is to support technology development and revenue growth want to expand our low cost manufacturing advantage specially to the millimeter where the only with it own millimeter factory and what at the end of the day is allow u to maximize longterm cash flow per share growth what the ultimate objective is CapEx percent of revenue a general guide we gave on our is could vary depending on whats on in the marketplace because of very strong demand when we are expanding capacity could run off right now on a month of course the reason would run off is we see opportunity to continue expanding our technology development and our low cost manufacturing advantage so ultimately we drive longterm growth of our cash flow per share you for and we can go to the next please take our next from with wanted to ask about OpEx in it it grew but a le than with ordinarily be typical there any driver to maybe push out of spend maybe into and guess along those line OpEx would usually up a bit change we should expect from what be typical there OpEx on it came in about a expected and we continue to be pleased with how we are allocating capital to OpEx in general specifically to our RD a it continues to drive growth in the top line and we continue to gain market share the subsequent a you we gave a on revenue and EPS we give in between the line If there something unusual on we would point out we are not pointing out because there is nothing unusual on in between those line have a followon wanted to ask about the Technical Difficulty grew yearoveryear also surprised given what heard from other player in space right now you give u a more color you in certain segment could you give u a more color about whats actually on under the cover in personal electronics guess whether or not you see the current trend actually extending into next given what is on in the supply chain me about this we are reporting and wait for result to go through the detail there described we saw growth across several sector and several customer so you we tried to point out there it is not the inset are growing there are other thing are growing of describe the growth a somewhere in the mid to singledigit good growth especially for a personal electronics Longterm of course we we see auto and industrial driver where been allocating increasingly our capital too the belief those be the two area drive growth not for u but certainly in our industry overall next from with inventory inventory grew about day inventory grew a bit a well you describe how you see internal inventory if you can comment on the channel where you are seeing the channel be helpful a well Ill about internal inventory and then about channel inventory on inventory me step back again and refer you to our longterm objective we talked about at the capital management call What do we want inventory for objective of our inventory is to maintain high level of customer service minimize obsolescence improve our manufacturing asset utilization and we also see value in controlling inventory having more of it in our own product distribution center more in consignment more in lowvolume buffer talked about this at the capital management call a well a day when we closed the last and this topic came up were very pleased where our inventory ended up a day space a it day from a up day is up day and is well within our day inventory basement from a channel standpoint inventory remains at about week and a a reminder for those are not familiar a pointed out there is we believe there is value in owning and controlling our own inventory and actual result is in the consignment program about of our distribution revenue is shipped through a consignment program so week represents maybe half to of what many of our peer run in the channel we feel a good combined with the inventory position we have on our book Do you have a follow on do you on communication equipment specifically month you talked about the being a bit choppy and guess you told u revenue were down yearoveryear and flattish what point would you this expect this to revert to growth is sort of in the half of given lower comp or do we need to wait longer for this to start growing again so wont try to predict what the back half of the growth for comms equipment you mentioned and you have been following the industry long enough you factor is choppy the way operator place order and the OEMs have to build inventory to respond to doesnt make it a bad is the nature of it and there be more communication equipment shift in the coming year we have a great position in product have a great position in product and any trying to figure out when mix begin to shift and we enjoy the demand a it come in right we go to the next please next from with you about what seeing you mentioned channel inventory If you can speak to your customer inventory a bit and guess shortage of thing outside of your space passive and embedded memory and thing Is causing any change to your customer inventory behavior in your either because they have inventory waiting for those thing are in shortage or are they holding more of a buffer or is it sort of a usual would we no indication of inventory growing or double order for matter which history suggests also and very quickly pointing out you never see ahead of with it is always important to qualify what we can see good visibility in the distribution inventory talked about earlier good portion of remains on consignment we actually hold the inventory on our book visibility in the customer inventory varies it depends on whether consignment or not with consignment OEMs we are carrying inventory on our book we are not seeing anything would describe a unusual signal thing expedites and thing would suggest there would be some other broader issue Now our visibility inventory beyond our customer manufacturing operation of course is very low our lead time remain stable Of course we always have hot spot we work aggressively with customer to close and other metric cancellation reschedules those also remain at very low level those are the thing we can see and we can measure for a long we try to keep doing what we have been doing which is with our manufacturing and internal inventory strategy we stay focused on keeping those lead time stable more importantly delivery metric very high because ultimately what give customer confidence they can get support from u when they need it have follow on next from with a quick one revenue increased the margin were down a bit can you comment on why happened when you at margin fall through which of embedding your there in any one sequential transition particularly when revenue about flat is up is difficult to do analysis and make have anything meaningful out of want to at it on a yearonyear and on our margin profit margin increased point the fall through about along the line of what we have guided all of you before on a longterm fall through you should expect from our revenue should be between to so my followup never but the tax rate continues to go down you about your plan for this extra cash Is it possible you usually raise the dividend sometime around August or Is it possible or feasible you could raise the dividend twice this not crank up the buyback a bit more you took your share count down by a of around me step back and about cash return and how we about and then how we about dividend and repurchase a cash return standpoint our objective to return all cash flow to the owner of the we have been doing for a number of year fact on a we generated of cash flow and we have returned of cash flow we are doing Now obviously we do in two way dividend or repurchase a dividend standpoint we want to provide sustainable and growing dividend of the end of last we have been growing dividend on a compounded for the previous five year and at the end of last also on a of cash flow underscore the sustainability the repurchase we done repurchasing of our own stock and our objective there is accretive capture of the future cash for the longterm owner of the we resell our assumption to extrapolate estimate what we our cash flow growth is to be and then based on we up with different scenario and valuation a well a the market price below those scenario we buy back the stock and what you have u do for a number of year now and we continue doing you we go to our next please next from with maybe could followup on the last on margin made on guide specifically in for but of similar Sequential growth in the whats the way to about margin is there any to about mix wise or such a to why the margin be up tell you of course for whenever you in fact hear a projection on we give the revenue and an EPS the bigger picture on is a we continue to drive revenue growth and the biggest contributor to cash flow growth then in addition to we continue on increasing our loading on millimeter which cost advantage one of our competitive advantage the only with own millimeter factory every we build an incremental wafer on millimeter we have better fall through on have better cash flow per share growth we continue to do for the foreseeable future and even beyond the current capacity of those tax in the you saw a good strength in embedded and particularly processor wondering if you can speak about strength in term of end market or particular product discussed be helpful If you at embedded overall and processor specifically they have a very high exposure to industrial and automotive growth is coming from very diverse place connected microcontrollers also grew very nicely a well and again includes our connectivity product there and they are doing quite well and we are encouraged because growth is coming from diverse place which give u confidence in the longterm ability of portion of our to continue to grow you we go to the next please next from from of you very much apologize if had missed it What were the order for the order for the were up about on and put our book to bill about and whenever give a book to bill always try to everyone we get about of our revenue go on consignment we carry backlog we get order running up to the they all want they have the new revenue capins always be cautious on both of those number have a follow on did and for the color Geo wise there any geos stood out a stronger weaker a you went through the you from a geo standpoint we had revenue up in three of the four region from a Asia up followed by the and Europe Japan is down a of comment so Ill make the comment is measured by where we ship the product and not where it consumed usually our regional shipment often reflect the broader macro in a particular region the then Ill add is from a Japan standpoint we are seeing company in Japan are building product in other region of the world a product get designed in Japan they actually may be produced in other region so wouldnt too much on a well you and we go to the next please take a from with a on what you saw a perhaps better and worse in the and it look the revenue came in a better than you had expected you about what the driver of so revenue came in within our expectation for the Certainly they are in the upper half of our expectation of course driven by industrial and automotive strength we saw very very broadly there wasnt one we point to again highlight one of those competitive advantage of diversity in line with position we can see of strength and it come through and show up even on the top line have a followup do you guess been in a situation where condition have been stable if not good for a while you have been doing this a while whenever the thing are good in semi we wonder how long it to last you about perhaps what were seeing now What perhaps is different than what we have in cycle Are there thing is doing differently Is there thing within the industry are different a compared to last cycle such thing would be more stable now What to point out for this is we are now a much larger in term of industrial and automotive percent of revenue is a of the end of last go back a few year number sub provides inherent stability to our revenue because our revenue come from many many customer many many sector within industrial and many in equipment Now mean we would be immune from a correction a correction would shortterm or in medium would affect all those sector but the important point is longerterm this is the place where we want to be because this is in both of those end market automotive and industrial where the is growing even if there is when there is a correction and we go through the end point down the road year from now still the same which is more and more content in those end market you and for one more operator take our next from with for taking my following up on the last if at the five and average for revenue growth been down low to mid singledigits and have been up high single and then been down the most your enhanced exposure to industrial and automotive do you still those average are good guidepost for u a we forecast your or do you it different now take a shot at when we at seasonality would you we still have a very nice calculator a strong seasonal pattern with the back to school along with the balance of the semiconductor in the been stronger in the and quarter a you for seasonality in general make and quarter stronger than the and quarter If you at those sequential change you see you can take an average of them but the lot of the last five or year is a very very wide of number are in there when we at it we about seasonality in those two quarter Do you have a follow on for on RD in the last several year in RD gone up by about to this RD down in RD grew faster than revenue and then it grew about in line with revenue in given what so far yeartodate is it reasonable to assume we might see more RD leverage this versus the last of year are pleased were allocating capital to RD even SGA and CapEx and ultimately to drive a top line growth in market share do based on longterm expectation on growth particularly industrial and automotive a talked about earlier given how well our portfolio match those market we continue to do if we have opportunity to increase RD because we have even better opportunity we do if not we keep it about where it is but we have any percent increase or number to give you you and with we wrap up the call you all for joining u of this call is on our concludes today call you for your may now',\n",
       "       'you instruction our come from with of you for taking my wondering if you could give u some more color on what seeing in different end market at the start of the at your sale outlook it in line with consensus seasonally somewhat conservative after seasonally or below seasonal you had in it seems to be in somewhat contrast to the very strong micro environment is there something seeing is keeping you more conservative than usual take a at the result in total If you at the came in with yearoveryear growth took for the the came in at yearoveryear growth if you at the outlook at the midpoint we would be at midupper or upper singledigit growth overall if you of continued to see strength in automotive and industrial exciting about of course is both of those market we drive our revenue for quite some of the a we talked about in our remark we did see weakness in comp equipment a market traditionally is choppy and then in PE it more of a mixed bag there and more dependent or varied by customer overall but again with doubledigit growth in the and growth for the consider a still strong performance Do you have a followon you maybe me ask same in a different way you grew in when at it pointing to a somewhat deceleration to which is still impressive but a deceleration regardless are you seeing anything in the environment is making you conservative and for a followon from is do you this is a sustainable growth rate right you give out full guidance but do you see the trend sustainable for the rest of the you so me now try to forecast the a you upper singledigits is still strong growth when we at the macro environment it overall seems constructive continues to seem constructive for u did see change in comp equipment wouldnt describe a something necessarily a macro effect is what it is continues to be a choppy market for u but a good market a market we continue to invest in and make money there for some overall were positioned well and again the overall environment in constructive me add to view take a step back and about on the sustainability the way we about our market it start with a global GDP growth to or so and then semiconductor should grow on top of or Particularly the market we focus which are industrial automotive and because where the semiconductor company have been then on top of been gaining share in and Embedded on a consistent you can of another point or two on top of for our longterm sustainable growth Of course any one even any one can vary but over the long haul this is a great market to be in particularly industrial automotive which is where were focusing our investment our effort because what the semiconductor content growth is happening you well go to our next please you instruction next come from with for me ask a Did roughly growth you had in your industrial any color you can provide on whats on underneath the cover there a very very impressive number and of getting at the same sustainability any color you could give looking backward might be helpful you bet and if you the number we provide you are a rounded percentage so would describe industrial growth overall in the upper teen when you yearoveryear and growth is based on almost all sector growing very very diverse one of the thing we we about it and for those listen to u regularly heard me about the different sector we have make up the industrial now include thing factory automation and control industrial transport and thing you would expect but it also includes thing medical and healthcare avionics appliance and those type of thing perhaps the financial community wouldnt put of industrial but behaves much in the same way why theyre in there were pleased with growth Whats encouraging about it again is it coming from very diverse source and it about content gain of market Do you have a followon do Switching over to the OpEx side for you either you or in there a big delta between what RD did versus SGA and then now also you have some better profitability with the tax rate being lower wanted to see what your view are on the OpEx side of the equation overall Will you spend more now you have more cash and how it be split if any difference between those two bucket what would tell you is at a high OpEx to u is an investment whether it RD or SGA the case of RD obviously were putting out more differentiated product focused on industrial and automotive to strengthen our competitive advantage in this case the breadth of portfolio for u the case of SGA there are a lot of thing there but one been focusing on is the migration and strengthens another competitive advantage which is a channel advantage we did in OpEx up about and were to continue focusing our investment on the part of your on tax reform and by the way on me step back for a during the call is a great very happy with tax reform to enable company USbased company to compete more effective on a global Now we are on an even playing field versus company outside the United States is great but our longterm investment strategy remains unchanged to continue investing to strengthen our competitive advantage a we have talked about before and now with more cash were to do and then were to return all cash flow to the owner of the which is our commitment a part of our capital management strategy and we have been talking about for a number of year Right you and go to our next please you move next to with for taking the you talked a bit about the communication equipment market and the weakness there Was focused on around a single region or a of customer or it broadbased and when would you expect part of the market to inflict to the upside it different by customer and it impacted our segment differently because of exposure and it hard to predict what direction market take over the long good news is our position even there is very broadbased we be reflective of the overall market People continue to buy communication equipment based station and thing for some to continue to invest and position ourselves well for newer technology a they out includes trend carrier aggregation or massive multiple antenna well see in later a well a standard very confident about those position and in the shortterm the market be what the market be Do you have a followon you had a on inventory at what you see in the distribution channel also your end customer specifically on your own inventory a bit surprised to see inventory tick up on a sequential historically would be flat to down if not mistaken if you can comment on how you would describe inventory would be great you me start and then Ill hand it over to and when you at inventory and Ill start with inventory the channel it remains steady at about four week Ill point out to those arent a familiar with u structurally lower than many of our peer run because of consignment program youll see a a half to about a a what many of our peer run and we feel very comfortable at those type of level What we see down channel from customer is well depend on what type of arrangement If a consignment program with them we can see very into their manufacturing plan and their build plan because we own material until they pull it but our visibility end there meaning when they if theyre building inventory of if theyre putting inventory down channel we cant see we see no indication of inventory building there overall me turn it over to about our inventory so me step back and tell you how we about our inventory overall want to maintain high level of customer service one to minimize obsolescence optimize manufacturing utilization and all these thing vary depending on multiple factor example consignment we have many consignment engagement and in fact we want to continue increasing consignment engagement because we get we tend to get a better signal to consignment engagement all is good stuff Also step back and about our strategy focusing on diverse customer focusing on diverse position on industrial automotive where we design a part in industrial and part may sell for even year the inventory is good for a long long we have to worry about this obsolescence risk maybe in the we have the other type of focus we had in this particular case in the inventory day ended up at within our and we had a chance to replenish some of our lowvolume high mix stuff were to we did some of fact were to continue doing because over the long haul a we would replenish we have inventory to sell to those industrial and automotive customer and be able to keep those high for customer service you go to the next please you next come from with afternoon for me ask a or maybe to follow up on the inventory guess maybe asked a different way were you planning to grow inventory in the calendar or did it end up growing because some revenue upside did not materialize in the guess importantly a you out to calendar how do you expect to management inventory for the calendar Will it down from here Are you taking any unusual utilization action around inventory to bring it down what would tell is inventory came in about a expected on the part of your of course we get into of detail but would tell you a mentioned to the earlier we want to have buffer of inventory particularly when addressing the industrial market but also the automotive market a good to have to these buffer and we have many many of our product are lowvolume high mix and by the way those are product last for we can keep them for year in our shelf and then we sell them to our customer for or year from a manufacturing standpoint it make to build them and keep them in storage and building them in batch and it a lot more efficient way we did in and if depending on the market we can now build some more in the and well do again and Ill add of the corollary to the point made do at risk of obsolescence if we have a part a custom or primarily used by one or two customer well tend to keep very low inventory on those part managing inventory stack to risk of obsolescence is something we aggressively do Do you have a followon to be clear is this a change in sort of your longterm inventory target or are we of still within those target perhaps maybe migrating to the higher end objective is the same far a the target a we do every we at our metric for the capital management strategy and a you we have or metric we at those and if we need to do tweak them we tweak them if stick with our call and well go to there and if we need to tweak some of those metric including inventory we do at point you go to the next please you next come from with afternoon and solid job on the quarterly you give u an idea of the breadth of the demand trend on a yearoveryear by geography last you saw yearoveryear growth in most geography except for Japan which flat wondering if the strength continues to be broadbased here it broadbased saw revenue growth in Europe in Asia a well a the but again this Japan down almost very similar but would describe the growth is being very broadbased Do you have a followon do for revenue grew by about in and if my memory serf me correctly you exited with your millimeter fabs diving about in revenue on an annualized Is it therefore fair to assume driving now close to about in revenue through your millimeter fab utilization roughly about right in zip code and so we ran about of capacity in our millimeter fabs which includes the Richardson fab and also so somewhere in the ZIP Code of about of revenue and a we at and to take a step back manufacturing and technology is one of our four competitive advantage millimeter is one of the best example we can point to of we have because of millimeter when you at the number of dy we produce on versus millimeter we have a structural cost advantage on every wafer we build and every dollar of revenue we put through there the benefit accrued over the year and have increased the great news is we continue to have a lot of a lot of headway a lot of runway ahead of u So… to build on is part of whats supporting the cash flow grow were seeing cash flow growth on a pershare with to illustrate the strength of the model with the competitive advantage our focus on auto and industrial and and embedded you go to the next please you next come from with guess for if you at your cash flow deployment over the last few year it take out around in debt and then the rest of it go to of one buyback two third dividend with the extra cash we assume those same ratio or would you to take out a more debt or keep the of the same you have a few thing there me may be take one at a with the debt the way we about is we take on debt when economics make and right now the economics make have of debt and is at a weighted average coupon rate the one we took out recently debt at Of course pretax the economics make and of course we do it in a very judicious way have we have concentrated maturity and we maintain a strategic flexibility the part of your our commitment is to return all cash flow to the owner of the u for a long and you been doing for example we generated cash flow and we returned guess what were committed to doing and we do it through both dividend and buyback dividend were buyback have a robust and flexible model to do doesnt have to be necessarily any particular split Dividends would to be between and of cash flow of the current and essentially repurchase is everything else Do you have a followup on Another guess historicallongerterm you are roughly on a sequential seasonal and if you at the six quarter before every to about seasonal are you seeing thing guess stabilizing or are coolingoff or any sign of in the industry or am looking at the number too much and doing a paralysis by analysis more of the latter when you at the number from the topline growth down to cash flow generation you see the strength in the model right been investing in and embedded They represent of our revenue They go through yearonyear Industrial and automotive make up of we wont control the shortterm demand is what it is but when you at those number overall at least when we at it we we they solid you and well go to our next please you next come from with for taking my question Regarding the nearterm OpEx trend last few quarter OpEx in light at least verse street expectation you guide shortterm OpEx but this it came a higher than at least what we had expected did OpEx in versus your own expectation in the and how should we be thinking about a we go into Are there any guess change or difference versus what might ordinarily see in a typical in term of your plan OpEx came in about a expected a short answer to the Then before go to the me take a step back alluded to this earlier but to mention and again we see OpEx a investment right Whether it RD or SGN and those were up for the very reasonable given the growth were turning our key market in analogue and embedded and industrial and automotive were getting the result we want from those investment those investment go to strengthen our competitive advantage and in the case of RD maybe the easiest to point out is the broad portfolio continues to grow and strengthen in the case of SGA the easiest one to point to is demand creation and everything were doing there Going to the part of your on the a you we get into detail there What Ill tell you it normal People are still to take le vacation in the than they do in because of Christmas and Thanksgiving and other thing and we still have pay and benefit increase in we expect about the same a we usually expect in transition Do you have a followup Stacey do you Around the inventory buffer you were talking about putting in place are you actually seeing shortage or lead time for those product actually beginning to extend to drive buffer addition or are you being sort of proactive about getting in place now how much of the guess inventory you total inventory a it stand out of the would correspond to some of these buffer area me start and then chime in on the rest of your but the buffer this is nothing new had about four five six year or so obviously depending on demand strength of demand it fluctuates were able to build or it would drain in the buffer what they are there for time we drain them frankly off the top of my head couldnt tell you how much of the and change is for the buffer but the bigger point is why we have the buffer focusing end market but industrial is the best example have a lot of small customer across the world in the middle of the in Shenzhen in the middle of Germany Small customer focused on sector hundred of end equipment couldn’t possibly build to order stuff right because if any one customer may order a few thousand piece so what you do is you build in in bigger batch you store it and then you sell over because the part and in our inventory last year then it very affordable make a lot of to do and we do with very low level of scrap in any one or any one Ill add when you were doing Stacey so our lead is to remain stable and then coupled with is we focus on making very high customer service metric when we we were to ship something we actually ship it on date to customer those two thing combined are what give customer confidence they can get the product they need from u we spent a lot of and maybe a highlight one of the initiative had at our a we looked at having more more embedded product more industrial and automotive we knew we needed to ensure we put in place the capability to be able to service customer of any size and have those type of metric and to add a bit to back on the way we at inventory about improving manufacturing asset utilization If you can improve and run the factory not completely because you can never do exactly but fairly go to a long way to improving your manufacturing process your yield your cycle time and translates into lower cost which get what translates into more cash flow and go to the strength of our model how we generate all cash flow we have been growing consistently for what now year we have for one more please you next is with very much a followon from Viveks earlier seeing a slight deceleration in your overall blended growth but in the you had strong growth in and embedded Would we expect in the sort of roughly equal deceleration in both and embedded or is it one more than the other we provide guidance at the top for revenue and we try not to get into the corner by market or by product now if there is something unusual on either those by market or a customer or in one of those unit we would call out and there nothing for u to highlight of there Do you have a followon good you very much Ill turn it over to me finish with a few comment on some key item want everybody to remember the strength of our model is demonstrated through our financial performance have strong growth in both and embedded which are the best product and industrial automotive which are the best market where the semiconductor content growth is happening and were confident the way it continue to happen for many many year to Second a before were very excited about tax reform made more competitive on a global scale so were excited about what we can do with finally we continue to be disciplined in executing our capital management strategy remain committed to returning all cash flow to the owner of the you all for joining u Again please plan to join u for our Capital on at Central Time of this call is on our you today presentation you for your',\n",
       "       'you well go to with of of is on for my is last you guided conservatively and ended up reporting growth about twice a fast would you contrast the demand environment this versus last the reason why bring this up is because your outlook of down seems to be below seasonal wondering if outlook hold true what are the area of weakness seeing driving this if you at our guidance were not indicating anything is atypical occurring you whenever had something been unusual whether been by market or by or sometimes even by customer been clear on and would share it and nothing to share point out if you at the of our guidance to vary and can comprehend several different scenario at the midpoint on a on well grow about which we consider to be robust do you have a followon of guess looking at your cash flow per share growth the last of quarter it of trended below the longerterm to you traditionally see wondering why is and what are the catalyst to get back up to where it been for giving me opportunity to about cash flow it grew on a and is compared to a higher number for revenue on the same the difference is higher working capital particularly account receivables and tax payment If you at the account receivable from to actually drained whereas from to it built is a source of cash in one case and a use of cash in another case and in the case of the tax payment we had a higher disproportionately higher tax payment in the most recent comparison versus the previous comparison you Tell we hello and well go to the next please well hear from with afternoon and solid job on the quarterly the cash flow generation and the capital return the demand trend are strong in the market you serve you could about the demand trend from a geographical perspective last you saw over growth in most geography wondering if the strength continues to be broad based would certainly the demand broad based If you across our product line to different product line and the demand very strong across those a well a strong across the region we had revenue up in three of the four region on in Europe Asia and the and it about even in Japan again always when we give regional color where we ship the product what we can measure Where product actually end up from a regional standpoint we have visibility into Do you have a followon for the color there the OpEx front great operating leverage drove sequential growth in sale but your OpEx declined by you are driving some serious leverage here OpEx a a percent of sale is actually below your target and so guess the is what drove the sequential decline in the OpEx how should we about the OpEx profile over the next few quarter Ill take OpEx we of in term of from a model standpoint we of it a a percent of revenue on a and for the last year actually been running at about in the current month were about of revenue we have in a stable environment which we are we can run in the bottom half of our expectation of to been running at about so well within Of course to u OpEx are investment and obviously go for RD but even of GA we of a large portion there a investment in RD of course were focusing on industrial and automotive because those are the best market where semiconductor growth is happening in the GA front we have many investment there on ticom and demand creation to continue building on our reach of channel reach of market competitive advantage we have talked about we go to the next to make a comment on the previous on working capital want to stress while our account receivables increased in last comparison the delta day sale outstanding actually decreased by day it at go to show you how healthy the account receivable balance is wanted to clarify great you and well go to the next please Speaker is Jerrell on behalf of for u ask a asking about the general end market here could you provide some end market detail in term of how they trended on in addition to on Jerrell If you at industrial it increased with most sector growing again sector there so fairly broad based Automotive increased with most sector growing Personal electronics increased a one would expect a you move into the holiday build with most sector growing there Comms equipment even and enterprise system grew due to both server and projector Do you have a followon Speaker a on the report here your revenue exceeded the high end of your prior guidance and it the in about a happened margin expanded point we were expecting more given the magnitude of the revenue beat why didnt higher revenue result in more than point of margin fall through What would tell you is generally what we suggest and what we recommend to analyst and investor to about our fall through in the to is over the long haul over a relatively long amount of any one fall through can be a different Now for example in the comparison versus a which arguably would argue is more relevant a it more obviously in between close to an fall through right increase in margin point a an example of a comparison to the sequential you Jerrell well go to the next please go to with USA good afternoon on the strong result guess my of you at over growth now for the core and Embedded had very healthy sort of double over growth wondering if you could of comment to what extent you share gain to what extent you is easy compare to what extent you might be a bit of overheating relative to customer order activity you did a fantastic job on your own balance sheet of managing inventory wondering if you could give u some color around customer inventory level if you at general market condition theyre similar to day and certainly continue to remain strong it still yet to be how long extend over how long of a of no indication of inventory growing or double ordering pointed out last history suggests we never see those type of thing ahead of again it important to qualify what we can see good visibility into our distributor inventory and remains at about four week even both and on visibility in customer inventory vary depending if were on consignment or not for our consignment OEMs we hold inventory on our balance sheet and we see any unusual signal or other thing expedites would suggest there issue of our visibility of course into inventory beyond and down our customer channel we cant see of course we remain focused a we have for a long focusing on both our internal manufacturing and internal inventory strategy were focused on trying to keep lead steady which they have Delivery metric high because what give customer confidence they can get the product when they need it you have a followon USA do for mentioned you did a fantastic job on operating leverage in the you at absolute operating profit though there still a meaningful gap between the Embedded and the commented in the theoretically there no reason why gap cant close over of the operating leverage in the Embedded particularly high the fall through almost on of Have we reached a scale point in where we would expect fall through to be higher from here on out and gap to close more quickly comment around would be helpful to your point the profitability of in fact improved significantly a on profit from operation is up point at the end of the day the main objective here is to grow cash flow is we believe is what drive value for the owner of the so and then return all cash flow to the owner were not particularly focused on any one of those percentage because there are many way to drive cash flow and one of them is expanding the margin then the other one is growing the top line at the same margin right the key message the core objective were trying to achieve you well go to the next please thatll from with Speaker there is Limz and Shirley Hu on for Sorry if we missed it but we were wondering what booktobill for the Booktobill it Speaker again we always we give number would always be cautious with it because of our revenue on consignment we carry any backlog or get any order in advance part of the reason why we focus on it Do you have a followon Speaker guess so were hoping for some more color on the OpEx and why it a bit light and how you see trajectory it came in about a expected wouldnt characterize it a a bit light a mentioned earlier on an earlier on a which is how we is appropriate to at is came in at in the last year it been at it trended a down over the last few year but it is well within the bottom half of our expectation of to which is our expectation when thing are stable which they are now you go to our next please with good afternoon you for taking my guess outlook on margin you about what expecting mix wise and whether fit in with an incremental margin around are there of put and take around margin what we have before and well continue to hasnt changed our guidance on is our general expectation is revenue to pull through at about to over the long haul right not in any one you should about it way a we continue to grow the top line driven by our investment in and embedded from a product standpoint and industrial automotive from an end market standpoint we expect to continue gaining share and additional revenue to fall through at about those rate Do you have a follow on please you provide an update on where you are on the millimeter Interested in term of utilization rate a well a some of the work doing on the back end and other front to drive even higher incremental margin you bet a asked there are caller on the line and listening arent familiar four competitive advantage the of which is our manufacturing and technology the millimeter is a good example of strength other three quickly are the breadth of the product portfolio our channel advantage which includes the size of our sale force and ticom and then the diversity and longevity across market and sector and customer and product which lead for investor a high confidence and a high terminal value of product portfolio why millimeter matter is a structural cost advantage with larger wafer size we get lower cost on the chip when we manufacture most chip in the industry are built on millimeter we started this had about of our millimeter capacity footprint utilized Essentially most of the growth this and a we have for several year is supported by millimeter actually give an update to in our capital management call on what the precise number are but revenue continues to grow on millimeter and we continue to see the benefit you for and well go to the next please with for taking my had for several quarter strength in automotive and industrial and continued in the you reported the outlook wondering if there any change in term of the relative strength of your expected result by end market well a you we provide color below the top line but certainly if there anything significant there wed call out can tell you there isnt anything significant if you at strength of industrial and automotive a we at a it for some strength been very broad based sector of industrial Most of those have been growing double digit for some continue to direct our investment across those so it a very intentional investment and return Same in automotive diversity across five different sector five of those are contributing to growth diversity is across the product line it across geography we feel good about strength Do you have a followon do more aware there been a change in compensation to distributor been well publicized relative to paying them for demand socalled demand creation wondering if there are still benefit to be made by if there anything squeezed out in the reported or anything still on the either in or beyond from change in sort of how you work with distribution you again we we no longer do pay for demand creation you indicated distributor of course continue to play a role in order fulfillment for our customer those relationship have been evolving especially a the reach of our channel advantage continues to strengthen a mentioned earlier even in this call is a unique advantage and includes both ticom and the size and skill of our sale and apps team those change began implementation three year for any account where we had direct resource represented about of the TAM then later last we implemented change with the remaining a good portion of is worked through and it not significant enough it to make any of these earnings call we continue to invest in our demand creation activity and we feel good about the result is producing with for one more call thatll from with are you wanted to ask about the revenue growth if you at sort of growth over the last month mean semiconductor demand it seems there a resurgence here certainly see looking at the performance of your and Embedded business it more than it coming from more than consumer confidence and how theyre managing inventory if you at the performance of and Embedded over the last month it changed your outlook for the longterm growth of the so were fortunate investment in capacity and a product portfolio is very very diverse rich in automotive and industrial which are the best growing part of the market change our outlook over the long the best signal we get from customer are order so were able to respond to those if thing continue to strengthen and strengthen from here if they go the other way a playbook ready to go if were to happen do you have a followon mean you talked about automotive and one of the thing we see is this shift to electric vehicle a lot of momentum and with electric powertrains we could see demand for power semiconductor accelerate how you about the opportunity in electric vehicle Is a subsegment is uniquely positioned for our investment in automotive are directed across five different sector powertrain is one of them which is primarily EV but if you at the other space infotainment cluster passive safety ADAS or advanced driver assist system and body electronics and lighting were very intentionally directing our investment across those area certainly a EVs become a higher mix of unit are sold on an annual well benefit from but were not dependent on it if bring you back to our four competitive advantage diversity and longevity benefit from ADAS system being deployed and a the industry march to autonomous driving or the mix of EVs Those are thing well benefit from but our model isnt dependent on them were real excited with the diversity of design win we have there and we a lot of runway there a well a of industrial with well wrap up tonight call and you all for joining u of this call is on our Ladies and gentleman today presentation we do everyone for your and you may now',\n",
       "       'you take our come from with is on behalf of one from me detailed how your end market change yearonyear you provide some detail on how you estimate they change quarteronquarter automotive basically it increased with all sector growing Industrial again we saw a very broad based growth across the sector and overall it also increased Personal electronics increased with most sector growing Communications equipment about even and enterprise system are showing also good growth Do you have a followon you talked in the about RD potential is being a bit elevated in near now you came in further to our model for the much longer could RD be elevated in order to invest in the Ill take would point out you are asking about RD but me address it from on OpEx standpoint at OpEx a a model and our model is turning to be between and of revenue mean stable time to be at the lower half of in fact why been in the last year here so to now we are running at of revenue and again in stable time we we can operate there Now of they are both in RD and actually in SGA we have various investment are strengthening our competitive advantage on the RD front continue to focus on industrial and automotive to broad continue broaden portfolio the SGA side we invested on to increase the reach of our channel cicom in particular we are thinking we are to continue to make those investment to strengthen the great and we go to our next please go now to with of this is on for maybe could you contrast auto demand now versus maybe six month Anyhow industrial is an even larger market where you even though auto tends to get all your attention wondering did it correlate at all industrial offset any potential demand fluctuation in auto and have followup yes the strength of automotive is something for greater than four year now attribute to our early focus on market the breadth of our technology and the overall diversity of our position We’ve five sector of automotive we are in investing in includes infotainment safety system ADAS or advance driver assist system power train which includes EV and hybrid and body electronics and lighting we are seeing good growth across those comms vector sit of the automotive market also diversity across subsystem supplier across car company across geographical region so we feel good about very similar story of industrial very broadbased growth won’t to speak to whether theyll be connected through economic cycle are not but both do have increasing content I’d be a cautious to increasing content could offset correction we may see in a nearterm in any one given or even in any one given we believe there be more content there over the longterm when you’re looking five and year and that’s why our investment are higher Do you have a follow on is more on your cash flow growth why if you at on a why cash flow hasnt grown yearonyear despite your core NOI embedded business growing into low doubledigit what’s the catalyst for maybe getting back to the higher singledigit maybe low doubledigit RafaelLizardi for this is for a chance to clarify in any given to have put and take on cash flow on in line with the PL but particularly on the cash flow on the cash flow statement this particular and also on a but what you see there is we had an increased tax payment in ’ primarily due to our outlook for higher profitability this we’ll go through the next please take our next from with of excuse me with had a on margin your revenue is basically back to it in the well guess bit higher than it in the last but the margin are point higher you of give u the reason why they are higher then what would be the margin driver Ill be happy to address our margin in of ’ ended at and point higher than in the same last a you reflect the quality of our product portfolio a we continue to focus on automotive and industrial but also the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy and a you we have the unique advantage of having millimeter factory at the chip provides cost advantage of we had about of our revenue running to millimeter and a we continue to grow the and in this case the in particular and growth primarily run through millimeter then were to accrue benefit over and over and it a cumulative benefit yield some nice result Through the margin line about in more important to their cash flow and cash flow for share to for the of the Do you have followup Another on out there at least some of your competitor have talked about their lead extending Is happening at all at described our lead time continuing to remain stable if we do have pocket where we a processor package supply tightness but we’re aggressively working those overall our lead time continue to remain stable go to go the next go next to with sort of a followup to the last one We’ve heard quite a bit about shortage for complimentary product SMEs in particular on the faster aside hoping you find out if is seeing any sort of tapping of it growth opportunity because customer are certainly not to order part if you they can get a full kit from all their supplier racing dynamic play at all would in general not we could see if there Ill you about of our revenue are on consignment so we no inventory of our product sitting in front of the customer production line they owned may have position one of our balance sheet and same with distributor but we actually do get demand forecast from them and those often time be several month out sometime even a far a six month out doesn’t mean they cant change would for where we do have very good visibility and wont see anything unusual on of there no one usual expedites or cancellation or those type of thing Do you have follow on you could comment on order linearity through the and book to bill so again make the comment we’ve of our revenue on consignment so there we actually don’t have order or backlog we only see those demand forecast book to bill is le helpful of but order if you at through the they were strong overall and they did accelerate a we went through the and into the of Book to bill overall and with we go to the next please take our next from with Solid job on the quarterly margin expansion on the outlook clearly macro dimension are strong in yearend market similar to our last wondering if you could about some of the dimension from a geographic perspective last you saw yearoveryear growth in of geography wondering if you can provide u with some detail on the Yearoveryear revenue up in all region so Asia Europe and the and Japan on a yearoveryear and true additionally on a sequential we saw growth very across the board there and a a reminder some of those a well some don’t the we attract our revenue on where we ship it so it not where product is ultimately keep in a so we may ship in to a car manufacturer or Tier car manufacturer in Europe and car may endup and be sold in China a an example it is not a good through for end consumption by market Do you have a followon do for the color there on embedded strong yearoveryear growth in sale your operating profitability up something almost point yearoveryear Is this mostly leveraged on the OpEx a you drive revenue growth are there some positive mix benefit not for example if some of your process solution is into automotive carry higher margin profile this is What would tell you the driver the main driver of what you are seeing near is the revenue growth a we have a over a number of year now refocused our investment in embedded and now being up very nicely They have embedded a quite a bit of our investment there is in automotive and industrial it is in and then those a we have those are the best market and there is giving very nice result you and go to our next please take our next from from Capital guess two question from me a well off historically always talked about this to point of share gained actually on an annual wondering given the inflection of RD high over the last several quarter now should we start to about share gain potentially accelerating or share gain happening in place where the margin profile is much richer when do you see those benefit transfer for you on the revenue line Ill take a shot at and if want to add something he can jump in would a we and allocate RD worth allocating those to the best project we can find one so we are to produce it get designed into the most customer into the most market and have longevity of revenue mostly about finding better opportunity to invest in and trying to settle the number of product a an example were doing we have found more opportunity to make investment it thing a our product live longer and repurpose product into adjacent market we found opportunity to be able to do and in general the quality of the opportunity share doesn’t shift very quickly so we are not penciling in an inflection point of our revenue when you at our competitive advantage and a a reminder all four those together and the investment we are making and includes the manufacturing and technology the most visible one there is the millimeter advantage we have broader portfolio and the ten of thousand of product we’ve the opportunity to sell more product to customer the reach of the channel market including ticom had mentioned earlier a well a our sale force then the diverse in line with position all those working together this is confidence in the in the future we can continue to gain share in point only would add is a you we about it quite a bit we’ve been focusing on our industrial for quite some now because they’ll start advance there’s of benchmark they have the highest semiconductor content growth we are confident continue to have for for many year to a of the end of last of our of our revenue automotive and industrial and obviously with the growth we are seeing yeartodate number appears to be picking up percentage number increase and we continue drive in a performance on those two segment Then mathematically overall revenue do better do you have followon do and hopefully don’t jinx the strength right now last four quarter all you have been much at the high end of our revenue guide you initially provide Is there a change in the way you provide guide you rolled up the revenue forecast thing have actually ended up at the high for four quarter in a row is it happened to be the case the later when we at the out again we’ve of the revenue we don’t have pattern to at but we can actually seeing the demand pattern our customer have can move in both direction quickly right even though we great visibility there thing can strengthen or we can very quickly on u we do have very very good visibility for of our revenue rest of we at we do at the backlog we at order pattern and our sale team provide forecast a well we go through our bottom up and top down approach the revenue guidance we gave for the is our best estimate of what we we’ll do you we’ll go to the next please take our next from with apologize if missed this what a bit about OpEx trend into the typically it’s a seasonally down for OpEx of is how we should be thinking about modeling it this are there some incentive or variable bonus offset might actually have OpEx flat or up be happy to add some clarity on you we don’t guide specifically on OpEx or GPM any line for matter matter other than revenue and EPS on OpEx and should on OpEx we focus on the model the to we’ve been operating in the lower half of we you to a lot way would tell you though if we had anything unusual on an OpEx we would point out to and we do not we also don’t have anything vacation or compensation adjustment sometimes or we do see to for example do not have on in a to concession add to when you at our history we had some restructuring in the last few quarter you may have transition stated is not a seasonal impact you see the typically Do you have a followon wondering if you could a bit more about what seeing in the auto market because clearly over the last several it been one of the better semi but there have been some sort of mix data point start decelerating some auto manufacture actually coming forecast in the back half of the guess how do you about of solid unit growth versus content growth how is the visibility there are you seeing thing others might have highlighted last week on their call so the one been clear our grown a very strong for four year plus now so and that’s due to the early investment we had made of this market we continue to make again were trying to ensure were making those investment a broad a we can so were not ending on one particular technology or one type of portion of demand that’s increasing clearly don’t it well actually content grown faster auto and if you go down into a showroom you can see clearly in any car versus even a few year we’re confident trend continue and also the announcement mentioned some car company have reduced their bill plan we certainly continue to monitor those market overall but were confident in our longterm position there and we continue to make those investment you and we go to the next please now to with Sorry about straddling two call and apologize if this been answered already the reported did the upside comp versus your expectation into the it thing were strong across the board we saw growth in most market most geography and even lot of the sub sector of automotive and industrial with three quarter of our growth came from industrial and automotive show you how strong those were did and this is enough always when we have this topic come up every of quarter and not surprisingly were in an economic expansion for a while now top of the cycle have metric you out with your cancellation booking and so you share them quite frequently with u where are we where is on those metric you would if you again of distribution our inventory there remains at about four week is actually down and down from a yearago visibility in the customer inventory is of course very depending on if for on consignment or not so with our consigned OEMs were not thinking thing unusual there such a expedite would suggest we have an issue and off course our visibility and the inventory beyond with customer manufacturing operation is very overall so again cancellation low lead time continues to remain steady all of those metric our very similar to what we saw day you and we have for one more call go next to with Financials wanted to back on the margin point so congratulation on getting to in the at the incremental for the it which is above the to but it had been for the last five or six quarter not unprecedented but a stepup Is something we should interpret a being more sustainable were there some either mix item or other lumpy transition item contributed to be atypical surge in the this is we would tell you any given the follow through be a different our the size of ours are there is a lot of put and take this big PL the more important to remember is we have some fundamental structural driver are have increased our GPM percent and we we are in a continue increasing our GPM percent for a forcible future those are the quality of their portfolio a we continue to focus on the best market are more even an industrial and the diversity and possession and long live possession we get with those where we invest our RD and we get the revenue for decade to then the other piece is millimeter a stated earlier is more cost efficient than millimeter accurse me and you starting one part on and then in the next part you started on and the part and the part and you making it all a bigger percent in term of your company is running on millimeter and it only the a of and the of the capacity we have on which used we have ample room to continue growing millimeter and accrue benefit to the Do you have a follow on you regarding the end market color you provided in response to earlier Comps are to be flattish quarteronquarter you what pressure maybe in term of where the stand with respect to how it looking at comp from a strategic standpoint and where you see demand is a we around and at infrastructure investment being made globally you so comp equipment is of our total revenue the viral or debt infrastructure be of which tends to take a lot of the call it more than half of end market owned by itself so pricing more in the midsingle digit a a percentage of our revenue you there when we at incremental dollar of where we are investing if refer you back to our capital management call we get stay back in we talked about the fact we wanted to increase incrementally dollar in both the industrial and automotive market because that’s where we believe the growth be communication equipment would we some caveat depending on which we are looking at Embedded would those investment are down versus where where maybe five year on the same view of theyre actually up because the some of the complexity that’s being developed of the radio we do believe market continue to provide great opportunity for u for a very long of we don’t believe there is to be significant growth we don’t if any carrier want to take up the CapEx over the next and year over a long of you for and you all for joining u tonight of this call be on our today’s you for your may now',\n",
       "       'you this well take our in the queue be from with go ahead afternoon and solid job on the quarterly a product and end market perspective it appears demand is relatively broad based wondering if you can comment on demand by geography assuming also fairly broad based a well but wanted to see if there were any region which are exhibiting any weakness would the demand very broad based and included regionals Year over revenue up in Asia Europe and the revenue about even in Japan from a have a follow up do for Auto a solid market for the team last with end market up you mentioned it up double digit again in a very diversified here a well Theres been some concern around the global auto market and the potential for a slowdown given indication production andor demand after two solid year might start to slow wanted to get the team on the health of this market of near to midterm definitely a we stated in the opening remark we saw our demand for our product in automotive continued to be strong so you built across a very diverse set of sector in fact five sector of automotive it diverse not only in the product we sell into but it diverse across customer across geos we feel very good about our position in automotive then over the medium and longer we our pipeline of design continues to be very strong if you at the average content in a car most people would put it somewhere between and roughly about or a more than of the sale price of a car a lot of analyst of a timeframe have moving somewhere closer to we continue to invest in it and were pleased with the position developed so far you Go to the next please now move to with for taking my question wanted to ask about OpEx Did in in line with your original plan for the or it different how should we about the OpEx trajectory into for the call Ill handle one OpEx everything came in about a expected What would tell you the way you want to about OpEx high talked about our model where we want to run OpEx between and of revenue and in stable market at the lower end of the lower half exactly what been doing for the last of year in fact on a were below a you you should model u along those line If thinking of on a tactical to would you have three month of higher pay and benefit raise versus only two month in you may have some of played in of similar to what happened last maybe a le than Do you have a followon yes do your capital management update from a or two you had given some indicator of where millimeter loading but it only went up a bit in it went from about over to so maybe suggesting a good amount of headroom left for transition to continue should we expect trajectory to evolve this in Is it dependent on growth Is there volume in millimeter ramping down a millimeter is ramping up Like how should we about where might end up exiting this in a normal demand environment in the capital management update if you remember we talked about the fact put in place about of millimeter capacity Last we had a you stated about so were in a great position to be able to support growth essentially been releasing for sometime now back to almost all of our new product to millimeter there some exception to of course on some older technology make to do but the majority of them have been released there a you about the growing you can of incremental growth essentially being built on millimeter if you at last came close to what happened we had about of growth so it very consistent with you and well go to the next please now move to with USA good afternoon for me ask a you were enough in your comment to go through end market in the on a over the comm equipment the only market you gave sequential color if you can a bit about the sequential growth into well above seasonal and sort of in the same vein to your guidance in guiding below seasonal how should we about from an end market perspective a of thing thought the comms equipment market been choppy in recent so we thought would be helpful and why we provided it If comment on the other market automotive market a we continued to be strong increased with most of the sector growing Industrial demand strong across almost every we ship into a a reminder different sector there wont put everybody to sleep by through them but we do have quite a number of sector are of and literally hundred of end equipment fit of it very very broad based Personal electronics decreased usually see seasonally then enterprise system about even when we at our guidance for if were looking at the low end of our guidance would suggest revenue would be flat high end of the guidance suggests it would be up if you at on a on the low end would be up and the high end would be up we fairly robust growth of the you have a followon USA helpful guess a my followon might have missed this and apologize but did you give an order number for the in general how are lead time either of your product or your competitor product because there been some buzz perhaps lead time within the industry are starting to stretch out order were up on to They were up about from a lead standpoint our lead time have stable a important a our ontime delivery metric also remain very high our shipping to our commitment we make to customer remain very high with we do have some isolated process and package combination where lead time have stretched but worked very aggressively on those were very pleased with where we are to be able to keep ahead of demand you well go to the next please now move to with for taking my question one is on inventory guess exiting the inventory day were at day toward the high end of your guided comfortable are you with what are you seeing in term of the distribution channel we are well Ill answer our inventory day and then Ill comment on the disti channel were comfortable with our inventory day well within our Always remember inventory day is a backwards looking metric so what we have it there for is to support growth the other key point to remember is a we have focused our strategy more on industrial automotive and on catalog type of part the risk of obsolescence on this part is minimal it make from a longerterm standpoint to have inventory to support revenue growth and from a disti standpoint we saw our inventory day of remain near their current level at four week benefit from our consignment program we have with our distributor actually down and it down from a we those are in good shape Do you have a followon you wanted to get your updated thought on MA have been consistent in the and pointed to valuation and the lack of opportunity a reason to stay sidelined but hoping you could potentially give u an update there if any change be happy to comment update is no change the same strategy for MA looked at were always considering option and looking at thing but it to be an opportunity is focused on industrial it focused on automotive catalog type of part catalog it to be a good strategic fit from standpoint then the other component to be there is the number have to make when we have both of those combination then we are willing to move on considering further you well go to the next please you move now to with Capital Capital a lot afternoon Couple question from me a well guess one fairly impressive growth in the side it up over Is there a way to about the growth in the excluding the consumer side where you may have had somewhat easier comp trying to get a of what the baseline number could be on a you go through the of all me make a comment at the talked about the demand driven from the strength we saw in the industrial market a well a automotive represented about of the growth and certainly we did benefit and see growth of personal electronics off of the easy compare a we all remember a we were working through an inventory correction in particular end market the great news is very consistent with what we saw of and so the growth is very very broad based contribution from the industrial market contribution from the automotive market and a well a we did see contribution from the personal electronics market do you have a followon Capital do guess in the automotive could you about if there a way to about maybe what percent of your auto revenue are infotainmentcentric versus more mandate driven around fuel efficiency or battery management or safety is there a way to about the geographic split in the auto a well you a great and for the opportunity to comment on it the great been trying to do or the been trying to do and why were happy with the result is our automotive isnt built on either infotainment or an ADAS is broad based when we at of the order of the size of those the infotainment is the largest Safety system is the followed by advanced driver assist system then power train which includes hybrid and electric and then body electronics and lighting and if you dive into any one of those area it not dominated by one technology or one product more than half of our to product line ship product into the automotive were very diverse from a product standpoint also very diverse from a geography standpoint a well so were seeing a benefit and additional revenue growth from all of the geos you well go to the next please this well move to with afternoon you for taking my Apologies for guess on a bit late so have a point of clarification term of the royalty commentary the included for a well netnet with top line would have been in margin of better then from here we should be using same amount the change in royalty included in our guidance meaning the royalty were in other income and expense how they came in in result on a goforward they stay in other income and expense for modeling purpose you can at how other income and expense line came in and then model it similar to on a goforward you guess a a follow up can you walk through some of the work doing on the margin side sound internally the is not enough and you want to take higher would love to hear what working on and assuming includes not only front end but back end manufacturing and would love to get an update there if you could you of the on a go the biggest driver of our margin is revenue revenue growth what were focused on industrial and automotive Those are the best opportunity we have ahead of u because of the constant growth of semiconductor in those space Now beyond revenue growth then we have millimeter manufacturing the efficiency of our manufacturing particularly with millimeter you recall from the capital management strategy walked through why millimeter is such a competitive advantage and because the cost of the chip is significantly le fact it le at the chip than on millimeter what translates to is not higher margin but more importantly higher cash flow then cash flow per share we can return to the owner of the you and well go to the next please the next be with Brett to use up my on a of revenue clarification in response to an earlier on the guess the stronger than expected revenue so are you telling u your automotive responsible for the upside in on revenue and comm a weak then on the guide basically guiding up below seasonality and also below what you guided for last not seeing any weakness or no change in the forecast over the last the is our revenue came of our guidance and so we didnt have any surprise there If you at all of the business and if you at the end market we saw strength across the board there wasnt an area we would point to singularly drove the revenue in the or from the midpoint of the guidance if you very broad based overall then secondly again back to Johns when we at our sequential growth rate of of the low end of flat to up or on a on of to we a strong do you have a followon Brett a longerterm talked about currently being outfitted for somewhere around in revenue capacity What sort of revenue would you start to need to order more equipment assume you wouldnt wait until utilized before you start to put those order in Is it utilization give u some color there Ill give you some color and then Ill chime in we of our strategy a stated in the capital management strategy for many year is we want to add capacity well ahead of demand because this is an asymmetrical bet capacity we can buy we buy way we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at penny on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reason talked about earlier and the great fall through we get to cash flow were thinking longer year out when were making capacity decision and Ill add you pointed out we had a over in revenue last under about of open millimeter capacity have open millimeter capacity of footprint plenty of room to grow for some if we had the opportunity tomorrow to buy another wafer fab or make a large purchase and it at the right price wed make move because it is an asymmetrical bet you and well go to the next please now move to with Capital for taking my and maybe Ill ask the same related here you at the guidance well actually if you at the overall not the only one seeing double over growth in all of your business Even if taken out personal electronics the rest of the is up strong the commentary actually suggests it remains strong guess of two part here how do you foot the gap between what there is content gain in semi but between what some of the end market are doing whats your perspective a you out the rest of the Do you the semi market is a ahead of itself then guess a you at your guidance did you apply any sort of conservatism to guidance to account for anything along those line so if you walk through the end market a commented automotive strong saw last had grown at over been growing very strongly for some again and growth isnt built on one OEM or one car model or one end market it very very diverse and we feel good about positioning you at the industrial market strength continued to build were seeing in nicely already talked about the personal electronics market and some of the other market in detail again strength and a you pointed out is broad based Others are seeing it a well of on the other is to your are we double ordering or seeing inventory build make the comment overall the economy feel a stronger than it did a it still to be to what extent we see this growth over a longer of we have no indication inventory are growing or double ordering but Ill also point out history suggests you never see ahead of right it important to qualify what we can see mentioned earlier our lead time have stable you into inventory good visibility into distribution inventory and a commented earlier remains steady about four week down down from a we in real good shape visibility into customer inventory varies depending on if theyre on consignment or not on consigned OEMs great visibility into their inventory because were holding it on our book actually our inventory and they pull it only when they need it were not seeing any unusual sign there so thing expedites and thing would suggest there an issue overall our visibility into inventory of course beyond our customer manufacturing operation and down in their channel of course is very low a we have been doing for a long with our manufacturing our internal inventory strategy well stay focused on keeping lead time steady and delivery metric very high because ultimately what give customer confidence they can get support from u when they need it Do you have a followon Capital and apologize missed the very beginning so if you already this apologize in term of your guidance of get margin flattish maybe down a bit wanted to make the right way would comment on is we have before our revenue fall through between and if you do math on a sequential youll get somewhere close to where you need to be you well go to the next please sorry take a now from with very much talked about how your investment priority were in industrial and automotive you give u some idea within automotive are there type of product or capability directing your investment at mentioned before were very intentionally trying to make investment across a very broad number of area they include thing are very popular ADAS system and infotainment system but also embody electronics and lighting commented before includes area turn signal Theres a of dollar of content in an LED turn signal and our sale team get excited about thing also sensor on door handle and of the infotainment system the touch button to control the AC or the audio system haptic system may sit of the steering wheel or in driver seat and LED lighting of a car Theres a lot of area were trying to direct investment to be very very broad based Do you have a followon similarly for industrial you mentioned the area you were to bore u with Are there any additional area on top of the you be able to go into because of your investment so Ill resist the temptation to bore you and run you through those if take one Medical a an example sits of there there literally hundred of end equipment sit of medical if you of at the high end there may be a magnetic resonance imaging machine may sell for million of dollar and then all the way down at the other end you have a blood glucose meter may sell for le than we actually have over different end equipment sit of a medical and a we make investment we to funnel those investment not in one area something factory automation and control a an example want to funnel those investment on a very broad you and we can go to the next please now move to with you on lead time you mentioned your lead time are very stable Youre maybe seeing some stretch in certain area if you at the general environment it feel the supply chain is overly nervous about getting product or it feel it controlled Again can only speak for what we see and what were doing again were advantaged because a large portion of our revenue on consignment so were actually controlling inventory up and to the point it get pulled also for many customer well get longterm forecast Those consignment forecast literally sometimes can be on an hourly but certainly on a daily or weekly and typically go out for six month in some case Now doesnt mean they cant change very quickly and before in the and they can strengthen or weaken and usually happens very quickly again our lead time are remaining very stable besides those isolated area were working very aggressively to fix majority of our product remain stable Do you have a followon very helpful a follow up you mentioned industrial strengthening assume mean it to be up more in than it in again is strength broad based or is there any region waking up a bit more than others especially thinking about China because there been some recent weakness there wondering if region is holding up a well in industrial the comment around the we reported and industrial strengthen now for a number of quarter in a row guidance for the we provide the top and EPS If there is anything unusual on in an end market we always provide color to be helpful we havent had to provide obviously for you and for one more please be from with with Capital United States for squeezing me in had a on RD and a it relates to OpEx you of articulated the OpEx be in the band you have provided in the so no change there RD on a over in absolute dollar been growing and in your last filing you mentioned you would be reallocating from manufacturing a well a SGA into RD of a twopart is one what should be the trajectory of RD a we model through the then of related to qualitatively if you could help u understand where the focus is for the RD investment you me address the part of clear been focusing on industrial and on automotive where we have been biasing our investment for a number of year and why were getting strong result in both of those end market Now over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive so those investment are paying off your part of your would take you back to my earlier comment our stated goal or model is to OpEx asking about RD but we to at it a OpEx because there are a lot of piece there we of a investment investment in sale in the sale force in ticom and a few other thing help u build those competitive advantage OpEx to in stable time in the bottom half of so to and we have been running for now month you should about way when modeling our OpEx you want to add Ill add you when we at making investment whether it in RD or in OpEx a we pointed out in our capital management presentation we gave earlier investing in the business is a top priority and what were try to do a indicated by market but we also want to strengthen our four competitive advantage those include the one which is manufacturing and technology ensuring were developing great process technology and strengthening our position with millimeter breadth of the portfolio is the and talked about a lot and how play out through industrial and automotive is the reach of our marketing channel and strengthening and continues to be our investment in ticom a well a how coupled with our sale force and apps team then we want all those thing to lead to the diversity and longevity and lead to good cash flow per share growth and what we want to do Did you have a followup Capital United States it you very much you all for joining u tonight and a of this call is on our again today call you all for your',\n",
       "       'you take our from with go ahead automotive grew in obviously very solid result you help u understand of the five subsegments within the auto what area drove the more strength a you noted automotive did grow over great news is wasn’t due to one can see growth very diverse it diverse across the five sector we saw diverse across customer and is also very diverse across different product line we are excited about the opportunity of both automotive and industrial and we’re very pleased the investment we made are of providing a base from which we can grow upon Do you have follow on do you for If at the recent industry data total is likely to be up above this above in your up about last but obviously the growth impacted by a largest customer have an inventory correction last If you shift this out the team they gained market share and if so in which of the subsegments you when we at our peer with the publicly reported data we actually believe we’ve performed quite well we’re earlier in the reporting season so we’ve a few more to of our peer to put their number up we’re very confident we performed very well you for we’ll go to next please go next to with Go ahead please congratulation on the next Phase for being patient the real reason you’re leaving is you’ve tired of winning for to hit my stock price so that’s a joke for all of you who are listening If you could list guess the margin driver and maybe rank them from here a far a how much room or how much leverage you have in term of mix versus millimeter versus utilization rate versus depreciation hope not to revisit stock price you’re talking about Margin driver there be several thing happening we’ve enjoyed the last of year Depreciation coming down same millimeter start to be up those sort of have been tailwind for u in the last of year we go depreciation is to begin to flat out there on a quarteroverquarter They’ll still be down next versus but nearly a much we’ve Whats the lot more important is the continued expansion of millimeter production a well a the continued improvement of the mix of product we are shipping heard u again for a number year about focusing our investment in auto and industrial frankly the margin opportunity in those space are very attractive still between the mix of product but importantly the increasing start of product on millimeter capacity there is still room for u to continue to see overall margin growth that’s before we even talked about revenue growth where this revenue growth give u leverage on capacity we’ve been investing for these of year with depreciation being a low a talking about what mean is underutilization charge of negligible so it about fallthrough from revenue straight to the bottom line and especially happen to cash flow so my followup longer on OpEx if we at yearoveryear your SGA trended down a bit RD up have you were to more money into RD assuming revenue continues to grow What can we expect from RD and SGA on a yearly Do you feel comfortable with the of RD a it is right here and could we expect SGA to continue to trend down a a percentage of revenue assuming overall revenue growth That’s a good last of year OpEx on annual base run about of revenue and a you noted we have been internally reallocated resource more percent to the RD area continue for next of quarter and begin to stabilize and would expect in all thing being equal still up at around of OpEx of revenue Keep in mind we expect our OpEx to fluctuate between and on very weak market and thatd be a high a in very strong market might be wrong a low a of stable market were in right now the OpEx percent in the last two year is what you expect to get for the next or two Right we’ll go to the next please go next to with Go ahead please wonder if you about the change to the subsegments a in particular Silicon Valley is a category only Does signify any from a standpoint in term of the integration of the old national Should we if there being any structural change to go along with nothing to do with that’s simply a of realigning our product to the way we have to understand and our customer preferred to for them when they trying to find product here at so if you at the category lined up with up a Power we have Signal Chain and we have High Volume Logic that’s how we have learned our customer preferred to sort of fine product at so that’s allows u to give them better and faster support Silicon Valley product along with High Performance been reallocated among those of those new product line talked about consequently the best way to about this is how do we react faster and more thoroughly to increase and search for product in our portfolio the balance portfolio ours it important for u to be we are aligned a efficiently a possible for customer to get to the part they need more great that’s helpful That’s helpful you then returning to the growth in auto guess we see the peer group is growing sort of high single digit maybe bit better so obviously you are growing quite a bit faster in auto than other company Should we of is being sort of sustainable gain how do you is anything you of help u understand why such a good number what should we expect this isnt a you and you have been tracking our revenue of market for some not something is capping this right have been having very strong growth of automotive and is a result of how we allocate capital have for some been directing investment and increase both in automotive and industrial that’s because we those are the two market are to provide growth not for u but in our industry and a you these are long tail type of design win and revenue strength we are very intentional a mentioned earlier trying to direct our investment so we are not seeing growth in one or at one customer that’s what we are trying to do for go to the next please go next to with Go ahead please congratulation on your retirement all the best wanted ask did you gave u channel inventory how much supply your distributor are carrying in the haven’t but would certainly can inventory even with the Eureco ph and decreased by about a half of week it still running at around four week in the channel also have a reminder number benefit because of our consignment program we have in place with our distributor talked about moderate growth again last but there been guess more recently about stimulus better GDP growth under the new administration how do you your distributor would react under scenario Do you it do you about it a your distributor restocking a a major driver for this don’t were quite precise on of thinking a how distributor might react at the of stimulus with some anticipation of the positive boost to the economy but frankly we it too early to figure out what might be and how might manifest it itself lot of stimulus seems to be focused towards infrastructure and so if in fact wind up there with the further benefit on our industrial portfolio More important to u a to watch whats happening on the tax front and hopefully we finally get some tax relief out of Washington which be a significant benefit to our shareholder Ill add if you a inventory even with where we ended last it actually down reflected in our number no restocking of it would the inventory level they have the inventory level we have reflect an environment where good product availability because of our investment in capacity ahead of demand if these thing do show up and turn into more significant growth were ready to be able to support you and go to the next please go next to with Go ahead please for me ask the congrats and to too congrats on the promotion Looking at the in the it up yearoveryear but you HVAL flat surprised side being flat and the remainder must have been up a good to yearoveryear you a bit about what the driver were created such a delta between those segment so if you at yearoveryear by end market personal electronics down slightly due to mobile phone if you back out mobile phone the actually personal electronics up slightly so the main reason we saw could of see of our weakness in mobile phone not of HVAL but saw to a lesser extent the Power the OpEx side of your equation you answered some question about the RD remaining elevated If we in the traditionally go up for beginning of the reason by about Is about the right area we should OpEx changing in or is it different issue due to reallocation wouldn’t expect anything particularly different reallocation is mostly coming out of SGA a we go so it the mix coming out of total OpEx continue to increase a you seasonally in because of the absence holiday in the a well a the annual pay and benefit increase we fully across our in go next to with Go ahead please Around the margin drive particularly millimeter you seem to be talking about is the biggest driver on a go structurally you to about u in term of where you are on millimeter utilization versus a particularly given the amount of extension you are doing much guess room do you still have to grow there how compare to where you were a we have talked about between Richardson factory which we call RFAB and the in Dallas location If combined we have about of revenue generating capacity in those factory combined have continued to increase start meaningfully on millimeter for is to be picking up pace more and more the new product we are released and are being released on millimeter the economics a you all aware are very compelling mean the bottom line is the chip cost are about le from millimeter versus millimeter the total finished product about le which add meaningfully not only to margin but especially cash flow that’s a small space we want to repeat it again our start continue to increase and we continue to have a lot of capacity to u more importantly we have a lot of new device and the pipeline being released onto millimeter and all coming together continue to accelerate the rate of start and therefore we also get from manufacturing market Ill add a a seamless plug for our capital management call and Ill cover more detail in our capital management call my followup want to touch a bit on the accounting change and it seems to be influencing both the earnings a well a the share count diluted share count went up this for the and for everybody it sound it boosted by share or so because of the accounting change how should we about guess to Is it still something a or per benefit to sort of sustain of into perpetuity in term of share count it sort of a onetime stepup should we still about share declining even given guess the increased dividend to reduced buyback a more background on this gap change it to impact all company beginning implemented being in the reported we are basically only adopted by one idea is trying to help with the better comparability for or being it cause reported earnings to increase because of this tax benefit also met medical requires you compete with your share count differently and so added about share to the share count complaint to new calculation rule had we applied to the same gap at the beginning of the it would have added to the for the for the and added a penny to the for total of for the way we would recommend you model for purpose of analyzing a is somewhat we are doing and is at what happened last and used same sort of assumption for next am wind up be in different when we close the book on those assumption but that’s the best way to model consequently we had would have occurred in the and the guidance we offered for the is included and we would suggest a it same me add to are for looking at next our commitment our capital management strategy and the discipline of strategy remains unchanged target is to return all of our cash to the owner of the with the dividend model we announced last it provides a more reverse framework to adjust allocation between of return between dividend growth and share repurchase go next to with of Go ahead please for taking my wanted to wish congratulation and good luck to and welcome to my it early day but can you share any view on impact from any potential borrowed tax rate change or conversely any lowering of the corporate tax rate What would do differently if either of these two thing were to happen this is very speculative at this stage because clearly you can see from reported press so there is difference with opinion a to what of tax policy to employ between the and the Congress it bit hard for u to be able to characterize what might do What can is any form of relief be beneficial directed to our shareholder because simply expand our cash flow a commented our commitment remains a it been best to return on of cash flow to our shareholder through dividend and stock not buyback any form whether it borrower tax adjustment or actual lowering of the overall tax bracket clearly be beneficial to our shareholder and am looking to seeing happen have follow on to Last you mentioned it seems it been in at to growth but then you grew in and you are guiding to plus in understand part of it is normalization at one of your larger customer what is driving the upside is it sustainable Are we now in a plus growth or whats the change this to deter u from of growth trajectory point out when we at the overall microenvironment we don’t see something significantly changed in sometime we continue to believe were operating in a very similar microenvironment we have we havent been If you at of the demand came in stronger across most market in business only notable exception a talked about before personal electronic came in about a we expected to your point we are seeing choppiness in particular market Some of more recently been driven by one large customer can go back to clock not too long into last we saw some choppiness in comp equipment before we had a XP refresh cycle came to an end none of those were tighter the overall economy there very thing on within market the environment we were operating in now you and well go to next please is with Go ahead please for me ask the and Ill chime in with my congratulation to guess my is looking at the up margin on the embedded did a great job throughout calendar a you grew to drive leverage and upside to the operating margin but there is still a healthy gap between the up margin and embedded and those in Is still the matter of getting more scale in the embedded how do we about those up margin closing overtime quite about it is but we have been talking about for number of year which mean you set up investment in area in number of year back then we readjust the investment especially for the base station marketplace and since then we the investment about right it is a of continuing to get leverage from revenue grown Falling always through to up margin you pointed up but again what we focused on fall through on a cash flow and a real focus there is nothing inherent keep it from continuing to improve in fact would not be surprise to see a the team there continue to improve on a they to put me understand where leverage capability they have on the investment base they have right now this is my followon apologize for asking but a lot of my question were already asked and answered on the other revenue line maybe if you at your revenue holistically overtime it become significantly le volatile but other bucket jumped around a lot on quarteronquarter me be give u some guidance from these level how we should about of seasonality or the cadence of the other rep if you for at it for the full it decreased yearonyear a we talked about before when you at the history it had decline more or in the midteens and primarily a the legacy wireless product had on loaned we expect of we would be somewhere in a midsingle decline is seasonality of the other it driven primarily by calculator they have a very strong seasonality due to back to school and then we also have royalty there can choppy every once in a while those are the type of thing but overall when you at much this we saw a decline similar to what we would expect to see next is the with Capital Go ahead please congratulation on your next phase of life and been nothing but an absolute pleasure in all the dealing we have had to do so you for is on the industrial auto is a great for you over the year you have been consistently outgrowing the industry but automotive is a a had given you not a lot of hard but had asked you why the didn’t grow last in but you are growing this again at a decent rate almost so what are some of the area are driving growth actually if you at the actual number you are using the rounded number gave you more the midsingle so a growth for the Europe for industrial over and it good to see good solid growth there we the down into the detail of the sector we actually did see growth in most of those sector again it of same comment and hit on the automotive we are encouraged our investment are turning to broad based growth Do you have a followon did the consumer side in specifically in mobile would quarter and be up yearoveryear would consumer be up yearoveryear am trying to understand is if the indigestion you had a is supposed to bear it last into or it behind u so we are careful try to give guidance on below the top line in any but your instinct have easy compare because of the weakness we saw a be correct have for one last call please Last from with Go ahead please is again on industrial and appreciate your comment about theyre being broad based growth in the if recall correctly this is the conservative where you point to an improvement in the industrial market place if there are any of region or end market area well that’s of driving infection and in the market and industrial there is a we are seeing broad based growth across region across product and across those sector we have in it were real pleased with growth Do you have a followon is a technical one the IP the onetime benefit you saw in from your IP agreement Is this onetime in nature could we see this materialized again in future quarter also what the nature of the contractor or the agreement for this it included several agreement with the several different cross licensee but the part of a sale of some IP asset and recognized and restructuring other line then the balance settlement of infringement recognized in the other income expense model an ongoing it tends to be multi across license agreement we would expect about of annual benefit for the foreseeable future a a result of agreement to these new intellectual property contract a roughly a annual benefit you all for joining u Again please plan to join u for our capital management call on at Central Time of this call is on our Ladies and gentleman this today you for your',\n",
       "       'you we do have our from with for taking my question wanted to ask about OpEx is roughly flat quarteroverquarter RD up and you talked about increasing investment what are your expectation for RD in total OpEx a we go into seasonally they would be down but given the increase we’re seeing in RD how should we it OpEx next a we’ve talked about RD what we continue to reallocate and we continue to reallocate through the half of next resource from other area of the into RD overall you should about OpEx in much being the same a you’ve in each of the last several year is down because we have seasonal benefit there from the fact there’s to be Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday on total OpEx the shift continued to be seasonally down Do you have a followup you a followup wanted to ask about the change in strategy between or apparent change in strategy between dividend and buyback Does imply and mean what imply in term of how you see the current return on your own stock versus the potential for at least how you view the stability and strength of your seems you’re allocating more into dividend now is correct are planning to allocate more towards the dividend at this point in We’ve always the buyback vary a a function of the stock price and a dividend model can vary from to we believe there is more thorough comprehensive or capital allocation new model provides a more robust framework to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchase and that’s what we’re talking about here great you please next come from with afternoon you for taking my guess on the margin side believe record level for you plus here the highest I’ve out there is high at linear do you you could achieve over and a part of thought process what percentage of your mix would have to be on millimeter to get to of the possibility for improving margin in are not anything we would hold back your expectation on because you’ve actually hit the essence of the formula there and is we have more and more revenue being generated on millimeter where we enjoy a significant cost benefit versus any of our competitor see falling straight through not the margin but all the way through the cash flow which is most important in our mind clearly a you pointed out this been a new height for our and still plenty of runway underneath a we go than add when you at our practice of buying capacity well ahead of demand put u in a place the end of last we had about of open millimeter capacity a revenue grows millimeter capacity help to grow cash flow margin a well a operating margin in the business you’ve been the fact it’s millimeter of course and the fact it’s lower cost certainly help u a well Do you have followup do shorter a you to your implied guide of down and typical seasonality is of throwing out the door here but guess in the last five year your average is roughly down is there any onetime issue here customer concentration conservatism how should we about if you at the midpoint of the guidance it would suggest a yearonyear growth of about in general we believe that’s very consistent with the modest overall macro environment that’s of been the case for the last few year our view remains we’re in the slow growth economic environment don’t see any catalyst that’s to change one direction or the other any soon you go to the next please next is with you for taking my is on the demand environment hoping you could provide a bit more detail on the different bucket within industrial personal electronics comms equipment in automotive and specifically what sort of trend you saw in the and more importantly what your internal expectation are heading into me about what drove the mentioned before the automotive market strong We’ve five sector of market and most of them had grown doubledigit Industrial demand improved and encouraging part of it very very broadbased and we had most of the sector growing Inside the personal electronics even and despite continued yearoveryear decline in demand from one customer but speaking to the diversity of our product portfolio and our customer base we were able to offset with growth elsewhere of personal electronics then communication equipment grew from a even lastly we did see growth in enterprise system a well when we into the we’ll call out anything is moving around significantly you’ve u do in the when we’ve had some type of discontinuity to help explain the result and that’s not the case a we move into do you have a followup Tosh do for my is on MA clearly been very disciplined especially with regard to valuation over the of year maybe even several year you’ve a lot of activity elsewhere in the industry hoping you could provide an update on a to how you approach MA detail you Tosh our MA is no different than we’ve talked about in the are four attribute we we have put u in a unique position versus our competitor and actually quite difficult for others to duplicate Those include our approach to manufacturing technology the breadth of our product portfolio our reach to our market channel and the diversity and all position our product enjoy in the marketplace when we at the acquisition it’s both trying to see if we can strengthen those four attribute and if not so by looking at company and standpoint of the strategic match mean we’ll have strategic match delivered to the strength of the competitive advantage we’ve been building on these last number of year from a strategic standpoint would include a that’s likely engaged in and good exposure to Industrial and Automotive which is where we believe most of the growth for some if is to happen for a quite a few year to If a potential target pass the strategy test and we’ve to get the number test mean the price we pay for it the return on price for the return on investment capital exceed our weighted average cost of capital in about a fouryear timeframe If we can get all to work then we remain disciplined and stay on the sideline we at what’s been on in the MA landscape these last of year and strike u there are two thing underway for most participant in space they’re either trying to increase their scale or broaden their market opportunity because they have fairly narrow market our case we already enjoy advantage in both of those so we don’t feel compelled to have to move unless we can pas strategy and match test talked about a moment you we’ll go to the next please have with guess one more on the revenue guidance am looking at the result of the last or so year and it’s only been down doubledigits once in eight year or something remember last you it down Has anything changed recently Have you any change in order rate any change in the end market change in linearity change in anything wondering why the downtime again no big change on it’s consistency with the overall macro and if you over the last five year we’ve had a from a high a down and back in we’re down certainly our we’ve given is certainly of those thing from a sequential standpoint that’s of how we are looking at them Do you have a followon you about utilization rate much sort of below capacity you are where we should expect utilization rate to trend in and how you feel about inventory a a result of on utilization it hasn’t changed much from last three or four quarter and don’t expect it to change anytime in the nearterm load the factory on accordance with our expectation of demand and because of our inventory strategy sometimes demand go beyond next may include the following an inventory standpoint to recall our model is to have to day had quite a bit more inventory last and we from a day standpoint and we had mentioned we have built anticipation of growing revenue in the have had those growing revenue and our inventory day dropdown to expect continue to operate within the model day we about and our utilization continue to be relatively stable a we’ve in the last three four quarter you please with you have one shortterm and one longterm the shorterterm you Personal Electronics of flat yearoveryear despite decline one customer can give u a for which area are growing yearoveryear a other smartphones PCs where growth component of right now at we’ve had PCs in yearoveryear about even which is an improvement from what we saw outside of one customer we’ve actually broad based growth so all the classical area a Personal Electronics are doing well you have a followon you then longerterm side a you at your automotive that’s a focus for you you a bit about how do you plan for and how much of your effort is sort of aimed at sort of traditional building block catalog type product and when you about market autonomous driving where there might be sort of system solution how much are you thinking about the sort of need to do something that’s a bit more revolutionary rather than evolutionary in part market yes so we have we’ve five sector make up the automotive market for u we at their infotainment safety Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or ADAS Body Electronics and Lighting and then power train system which include hybrid and electric system we have a very intentional focus to invest across all of those five sector seeing in the result with revenue and most of those sector growing double digit and we have an approach of Automotive is similar across their other market where we to leverage our four competitive advantage and that’s helping to turn in those result we are favoring what would a catalog and application solution wouldn’t put into the category of full turnkey system solution where we’re doing what we would consider to be the work our customer do we are providing them Building block have different level of integration but we’re not looking to provide a full ADAS system a an example enable those system and that’s consistent with what you see across all the market and sector we serve so and we’ll go to next please we have with you guess would be regarding your comment on the industrial you talked about some broad improvement guess could you about your of visibility there and the likelihood of sustaining into the end of the and moving into next you ask once again make the right Sorry it regarding the Industrial and your comment on you talked about broad improvement If you can give some more color on and your view on the potential for to sustain into end and into next a we talked about last we did see an improvement in industrial demand it actually had been flat for several quarter yearonyear so we were encouraged by we’ve built on a bit and last it very very broadbased won’t try to go in and try to predict how long last or carryforward but definitely would we were encouraged a we saw most of those sector growing followon do followon is regarding inventory in both the channel at your customer and given the stronger growth in any part of growth perhaps contributed to some increase in inventory understand most of your inventory in the distribution channel on consignment now but what’s your view of customer inventory level right now if we into the distribution channel inventory is actually decreased by about a half a week and it’s currently very very low level at about four week and that’s similar to what we saw a yearago again we we believe inventory reflects an environment of good product availability and we’ve you good inventory on our book to be able to ship continue to have very stable lead time and those thing of taken together drive very high customer service metric customer in general are getting product when they want to have them and make the reminder too four week of inventory is structurally lower because of the consignment program we have at our major distributor you and we’ll go to the next please have with you is on the embedded side been growing well for the last in the posting good yearoveryear growth driving it three major segment you help u understand the driver behind the growth when you at the embedded market We’ve good growth there for a number of quarter and if you at the end market they have a very good exposure to automotives to industrial and to the comp market a we talked about the communication market or all three of those market contributed to the growth the great about the growth is it’s very broadbased it not in market it’s not in one it’s not driven by one technology we feel good about the sustainability of growth and the great with is it’s fallen through to the operating profit which you can see of most importantly is following through to cash flow growth you have a follow on did you a bit your this seems to be a change in the relationship with how you work with your major distribution partner and our is this is nothing new but could you help u understand how you thought through the pro and con of this change and whether it’s a matter of you having more in consignment or it’s tradeoff between confidence of sourcing your own win versus potential loss in future sale you our relationship with distributor have been evolving and always evolving any healthy relationship of all but especially a the reach of our channel advantage continues to strengthen you you’ve heard and both mention our four competitive advantage and certainly the reach of our channel is one of them so includes both the size and the skill of our direct sale and application team but it also includes the growing capability of the web and TIcom a an example three year we discontinued our incentive program for demand creation on account represented about of the TAM where we had resource calling on those account directly made change because our team is more effective and efficient at and demand creation and this is played out a we’ve continued to gain share every since then more recently we’ve discontinue the incentive for remain balance of the account we expect a with all relationship continue to evolve but we do believe distributor continue to play an important role in order fulfillment for our customer you we go to the next please have with very much and several other chip company had impressive yearoveryear growth many percent about guidance and you’re also giving guidance which is solid even then the yearoveryear growth in look it’s to be below you give u some feel a to what’s happening here thing weaken and progressed or is particularly tough comparison if you at our normal seasonality the one we can for is the and are seasonally strongest quarter and are seasonally weakest and so certainly play in effect a we go into it’s not unusual for u to see that’s down and in fact why we point to the yearoveryear guidance and how is consistent with our belief is thing in the macro haven’t changed too dramatically gone into the guidance Do you have a followon am good you you next is from with of for taking my and congratulation on the strong result and dividend boost also try my hand on this outlook still don’t whether this is a top down forecast or it’s a bottom up forecast because with end market is down so much for your overall sale to go down don’t whether it’s actually the other which had very strong growth in and you mentioned on an yearonyear but last believe your sale were down in the comp should have been easier versus the last so that’s my is this top down forecast or is this a bottom up forecast answered same about three or four time now and the answer still to be the same is our best outlook right now based up on a continuing weak macro economy had a booktobill in of compared to a the visibility into the is a bit reduce versus it a is no one market no one customer no one product it is our best estimate at this point in you it include a and comprehends to high probability where land quarter add the fact whenever we’ve had a big discontinuity you’re searching around for we’ve been clear at following those thing out we want to be able to provide transparency when it’s necessary do you have a followon you Now given the focus on cash flow why isn’t better utilizing an asset your balance sheet because you’re operating if my number are right at about net debt to EBITDA and most of your peer are comfortable operating at three to four time given this low growth environment and sort of negative return for holding cash why is holding so much cash and why not buyback more of your stock if you MA look expensive or not attractive right now you it now you consider our stock quite undervalued at the moment in time appreciate observation have been buying back share every since the of our method for buying back share is to be disciplined and consistent in how we go about doing it More importantly what we’ve talked about is we buyback more share when the price is lower and fewer share when the price is higher so to end we recently a with today’s announcement have updated our allocation budget if you for what we allocate in cash flow to dividend from of our four year average cash flow to to this new provides a more robust framework allows u to adjust the allocation of our shareholder return between dividend growth and share repurchase To a far a leveraging the balance sheet any further right now balance sheet been leveraged higher in the we have been slowly paying debt back down over which mean the debt is and important strategic opportunity present some at the right moment in believe leveraging now for the sake of leveraging would actually block the balance sheet and being should an opportunity present ourselves out there from a strategic standpoint great you we’ll go to the next please next is with Capital a lot I’ve a and a followup a well guess starting on the dividend increase you announced you about a about the future dividend payout strategy you have Is it to be more reflection of your cash flow growth on an annualized or with the desire be to increase dividend along with cash flow growth plus increasing the payout a you get to the midpoint of this to how do about this on an annual if you about what you have been seeing is what you see and is our cash flow been growing consistently for quite a few year now our formula design mean by definition are dividend are increasing consistent with What this new is give u more framework to adjust the allocation between dividend and stock buyback call it we take all the cash flow and we use it either for dividend or buyback this allows u to allocate more towards dividend growth a opposed to buyback If we reach a point where share price tends to be relatively lower at a point in then this allows u to slow down the dividend growth rate and adjust back towards dividend repurchase that’s what this new is designed to do is to give u more flexibility to be responsive to the changing market valuation we see out there Do you have followon Got it If can followup your RD is sort of increased doubleddigit the few quarter sound it do so again Does suggest you of shifting a bit from harvesting towards investing more in your if that’s the case should we recalibrate expectation maybe in calendar and the share again you are typically out point could be somewhat higher given all the investment you’re making certainly we’re investing more in the RD with the intent of continuing our share gain and ideally accelerating them what we’re doing on the stuff we are being very disciplined on RD a well not spending for the sake of spending but we’re spending because we have a higher degree of confidence and the idea are coming to u we can actually turn into profitable revenue growth and ideally market share we’re doing by reallocating our internal resource a we mentioned meaning we’re not taking our total spending up but we’re taking people who may have been working in the manufacturing line or people who may have been working in sale or general administrative area and putting them into working on RD project a well it’s an overall reallocation internally and would expect continue to support our market share gain a we go would add we’ve gained on average to point of market share and we’ve gained share each of the last six year we’re on track to be able to put a seven figure up and we’ll wait for the number to get posted before we declare again market share doesn’t move quickly in the market we’ve and speaks to the quality of the market these opportunity talking about give u confidence we can continue to have share gain into the future and we go to the next please next is from with Partners you your comment you talked about being opportunistic in term of purchasing asset ahead of demand so do you anticipate any greater opportunity or fire sale a the industry would rapidly consolidates mean you enough wafer fabrication equipment but maybe there’s other area test and packaging would we are continuously on the lookout for buying asset we don’t need now but we believe we need at some point in it could be a strategic cost advantage to u at some point in and we have been in much every picking up some piece of equipment here or there again we at the total opportunity meaning can we get the right price and can it be something contribute to our cash flow a we go and so we at it in context when we consider these sort of thing would expect we continue to be out there making opportunistic acquisition Some may rise to the of an announced but most of them are remain a they have been spot purchase we do from to a we around the world and also point out we’re making those purchase while keeping our CapEx at about of revenue so continuing to strengthen competitive advantage Do you have followup over to embedded processing Questions on expectation for DSP application should we of it is largely communication infrastructure and noticed there is DSP company out there they are talking about using these chip a accelerator for thing Deep learning artificial intelligence accelerating some application when you at our portfolio the line between what the DSP and what’s not a DSP blur to some degree so you in the comm’s equipment space you’ve processor have multicourse of both arm and DSP’s but also have a heavy component of hardware accleators OMAP product are gaining traction and automotive and other application of industrial have DSPs of them If you at our communication product where we support over a dozen different standard help machine be connected and be smarter they have now DSP of them we of at a an enabling technology the good news is complement our product portfolio very well it isn’t one type of product or technology that’s building We’ve a very good diversity of customer we’re building over we’re encouraged by the confidence in the sustainability of revenue and the wire underneath and the technology underneath are important on how we deliver it the model is what’s encouraging for u we can go to have for one more please next is from with for squeezing me in here guess my is you talked about OpEx being down in Depending upon how much down it is you could still have margin of flat to up in the and notwithstanding the revenue decline you’ve had in prior quarter were down revenue doesn’t necessarily mean down margin of how you about margin into the calendar and what leverage you can still pull other than volume to keep moving margin up into the right you we normally don’t try to give precise of forecast other than topline and bottom line and earnings would you benefited from lower cost we increased production in the millimeter and depreciation rolling off Depreciation continue to roll off and millimeter continue to become a bigger portion of wafer we start you’ve a number of underlying cost thing continue to give u good result on the overall margin for those who are interested in number That’s helpful appreciate it then guess is my followup talked about your largest customer in Personal Electronics being down yearoveryear in the Do you that’s an accurate reflection of of their unit demand or is there something on with your content or your pricing Would you expect customer to be down again yearoveryear in the not to make any comment on their command with most of our large customer if generalize the comment most of our large customer be on some type of consignment or hub based system there is usually not a large delay and the demand when it actually get pulled and when it’s used There’s always an exception to overall a content standpoint we’ve mentioned before we sell hundred of product into our largest customer including our largest one and we continue to see win new product we’re confident in the design win we’ve and the revenue drive overall well you for your call End of QA everyone for listening tonight of this call be on our today’s call appreciate your',\n",
       "       'you our from with it seems the revenue above the midpoint you you maybe about the strength you saw or what stronger than expectation by or by end market of Ill across our business most area performed a bit better than our expectation there always put and take but in general the case obviously put u solidly in the upper half of our for my followup if we plug in some sort of normal seasonal growth in it look rev be flat to slightly up it look OpEx might be up a a percentage this Is true you shed any light on whether could happen or it could not happen or what would be the driver there you Did you mean to already it for but if we plug in some seasonal growth for you get revenue around the same a last look OpEx might be a bit higher a a percent of revenue this versus last is true you comment on or about the put and take on OpEx Ill wait day and give you what we the is to be for revenue and then we of about where is Right now well focus our comment on and if you mind of you well go to the next please next come from with for taking my question could you give u an idea of in the current how much personal electronics down yearoveryear for how do you see trending Do you still see down yearoveryear in of we get to of detail can we did see sequential growth a we were expecting to see it is obviously still down significantly yearonyear and we havent provided guidance out into again if there anything moving around significant our practice have been to call out to provide clarity with our result coming solidly in the upper half and our guidance were providing were not to of detail at this Do you have a followon you give u some idea of margin driver in the seems margin came in a stronger how do you see those driver trending into next Do you margin should be up on the higher revenue driver to margin in last and for the foreseeable future are the same thing been seeing for a while and is were seeing depreciation rolling off which is clearly giving u an accounting benefit to margin but more importantly increased production on millimeter which is considerably more cost effective on a chip than the equivalent millimeter production a we see depreciation continue to roll off albeit more slowly a we move into future quarter and more production on millimeter well continue to see benefit to margin what on is a prelude to what youll see on a we out a bit further If you out further in a to what to expect wed tell you to do what been doing in the which is on any delta revenue you forecast in your model fall through around on average over give you a good way to anticipate what the company margin stack up a of you and well go to the next please next come from with Capital Capital for taking my guess off CapEx look it a bit higher a line you have talked about in the you about how do you about it for the rest of the and at what point you CapEx approximates inflation you were a quiet you were saying CapEx a higher than in the of what had heard too having a bit of trouble hearing you so to summarize your you were saying CapEx higher than it been in the recent and why is Capital sorry Right at what point do you CapEx is to approximate depreciation for you over CapEx is to be noisy in any one it make most to of at it on what we is a over the last month CapEx running about well about over last month revenue Depreciation been running about to the last month revenue obviously those converge at some point but expect those to converge before the end of They may converge in any one but on it take a more quarter before we see those meet up again remember our longterm model is to keep our CapEx spending at around of revenue and includes the conversion and expansion of our millimeter capacity for production of Do you have a followup Capital Got it if could follow up OpEx guess at least in the it look it higher than expected Sort of compare with what happened in the if not mistaken could you about how do you get OpEx a a percent of sale and whats driving the higher uptick there sound it look it more RD than anything else in the half of the so far not so it higher than expected per se but it certainly higher than it last and higher on a yearoveryear a of thing on there Sequentially three full month of pay and benefit increase so last you only had two month worth also true yearoveryear by the way pay and benefit increase also importantly on the RD a you noted we have been for a number of quarter now reallocating our internal resource towards more development effort those be resource may have been working in manufacturing support or may have been working in SGA and were redeploying those resource into development activity and RD we expect to continue doing for a number of quarter to so consequently seeing RD begin to move up a bit more than you might see on the GA line of you go to the next please next be with good afternoon you for taking my guess a to go back to your incremental margin and try and maybe dig a bit deeper in understanding how much is off of DA mix utilization the benefit of millimeter if we at calendar and thing play out seasonal it look benefit from DA but another from those other category Is there any way to parse out and then better understand go what might for each of those category mix utilization millimeter to about from another utilization standpoint frankly there no real benefit on there underutilization cost and almost exactly the same for multiple quarter in a row now Depreciation actually down so you compare the most recent at depreciation the yearago getting about a depreciation lift the rest of it lower overall manufacturing cost again incrementally were getting more production on millimeter which at the die a cost benefit for u an overall improvement to profit margin on or excuse me take profit margin up effectively because cost come down by amount the combination of all those thing weighing together again depreciation down about to on a yearoveryear Underutilization charge flat throughout it a conversion to lower cost manufacturing of Right Ill add for those may not follow u a closely why millimeter make a difference so a footprint manufacturing product at millimeter and the millimeter we ended last with about of open capacity on millimeter and the wafer size is bigger and translates into a lower cost a talking about at a chip where the silicon is lower basically a we build more of our product on millimeter help to drive margin a well a cash flow you have a followup very helpful If could ask a shortterm term of margin into mix be a headwind there or should we margin at least flat you mix is to play too much of a factor in this to continue to have more production on millimeter and lower overall manufacturing cost and it the economics mentioned to keep on helping on margin of you and well go to the next please our next come from with you wonder if you can give u an update on the Embedded Processing Youre showing some nice growth there you about where coming from and in particular the old the previous wireless business OMAP connectivity can you about growth you might be seeing there of yearoveryear a we had before were seeing good growth in all three product line and a a reminder for we had three product line of Embedded microcontrollers which made up of revenue processor again and connectivity at Ill over the last few year connectivity been growing very strongly though it coming obviously from a much lower revenue base there we support a dozen or so connectivity standard and those product are finding very very diverse different application and doing very nicely Processors again is doing very well is being benefited from both the automotive a well a recovery we saw of comms infrastructure then microcontrollers is benefiting from the industrial market a it is finding very very diverse application of what look across the board Do you have a followup very helpful you separately wonder are there any area where seeing tighter availability or lead extension or anything across the whole portfolio of across the board our lead time have unchanged and at very very low level product availability continues to be very good both at our distributor a well a for the product we support through consignment program or in a classical book shift no change on also mention our ontime delivery so of our metric to when customer want to have them remain at very very high you go to the next please from with for taking the and nice job on the result and wanted to follow up on Embedded Processing operating margin the last of year the company had the objective to get them higher and done a lot on the OpEx side and now for a consecutive were in the mid s you put in context where operating margin are now versus level the would be happy with Is it possible to get to level or are we at optimal level now with EP on would there nothing inherently different between the and Embedded point to to why margin would be different What would is while we wont try to predict margin in the individual segment per se were confident Embedded Processing can be a very solid contributor to cash flow growth over the long haul again this is largely because the product we manufacture in have very long market shelf life and so you can get a lot of revenue stream off of your RD you spend may recall over the last year ending early last we were doing some restructuring activity in Embedded Processing and taken some cost out and been talking for a while now the real secret to being able to improve the profitability in area on revenue growth team been doing a very good job at turning the result of their effort into solid revenue growth and consequently were seeing the profitability go up They are committed to continuing in direction and so to seeing what they turn in a we go multiple quarter out of Do you have a followon followup is related to Chriss mentioned the performance of the a bit better than expected on a broadbased in the Was because the order strength in the better than the team thought into the or in fact the scoped a bit more conservatively than it played out What accounted for the upside versus expectation of would point to of our revenue run through consignment so we actually get order there get forecast get pulled to actual demand of our revenue run through distribution and of is actually on consignment our what we ship the demand we ship to is much closer to real of what customer want and need very simplistically they ended up pulling more slightly more than what we were initially expecting across a broad if there something in there we could point to one or two thing we would do but not the case this you go to the next well go to with USA good afternoon for me ask the question on the strong consistent result wanted to a bit about OpEx pattern into the calendar the last of three year had good sequential revenue growth in the calendar of about and been able to take OpEx down on average by about so of is there a seasonal pattern to OpEx we should about for the calendar in general and specifically how do you see OpEx trending this it well in you do tend to see some pattern similar to the number you recited Typically youll see SGA and RD down a bit in versus and part of is people taking vacation and so on for the summer holiday this youll continue to see sort of trend in the SGA area would expect RD would continue to increase a bit a we move dampening the overall decline you might expect in OpEx again to do with what mentioned earlier in the call for a number of quarter now we have been redeploying resource into development activity those cost are winding up in RD a we redeploy those resource a you into again to see GA be down again a bit but RD be up some of Is there a followon USA helpful a followon one of the thing you have always sort of talked about is the consistency of growth here and not necessarily absolute growth albeit talked about sort of modest share gain expectation every when at the Embedded Processing growth of over yearoveryear to me clearly is sort of outgrowing the industry and the peer so of what do you the cause of is sustainable is and of should we expect to see continued market share growth within the Embedded at these sort of clip of finish the before we declare any victory lap on market share gain if you at a well a you had steady share gain talked about averaging between point and point per had year where put up point gain in the again we want to get ahead of where the end wait till the scoreboard is up before we analyze we we continue to focus our resource in place where we can develop product are to be differentiated are to find a longlived position in the marketplace when able to do able to have a revenue stream in which able to build on the great about both these market is share gain doesnt move quickly so but it steady share gain over make a significant difference to the model we is certainly showing up in the number go to the next please next is from with you to start with of a bit of a bigger picture talked about some of the forecast visibility from your consignment revenue you a bit about how far out go and what the order pattern are telling you then correspondingly what have you with regard to order rate over the last day a compared to the previous Are they fairly stable improving or declining of it depend on the customer or distributor typically well get out on demand out for six month Sometimes it be longer well get a longer forecast for them usually they run about six month Inside of a certain window those forecast are deemed a more firm they can change and they can change very quickly we can have visibility but doesnt mean those forecast cant change an order standpoint can tell you during the we saw order were higher in They increased again in of what happens in a those order rate versus when we were all on a book ship without consignment certainly were a different signal than what they are we at those the order we have on the book at the consignment forecast we see and we make judgment based on and roll all up to what we provide you in our outlook you have a followon regard to inventory it look it down in day but believe it toward the higher end of your you about your expectation suppose you would expect to drop a you go to the half Do you have a particular target in mind for where you expect the inventory to approach a we exit the then what implies for production in the half you often try to load production given seasonality Is still the case this have a inventory forecast for you per se point out a thing on inventory to of keep in mind Total dollar of inventory are actually down on a yearoveryear even though day are up and a function of the higher profitability the company performing at now you do the math at a higher margin percent same inventory affords more day of potential sale part of whats on there a you noted it is down quarteroverquarter on a day typically into typically tends to be an up revenue for u and a you mentioned when we load the factory would anticipate some of inventory be drained a we go through the we have a forecast a to day or dollar expect drain somewhat into the and then well continue to adjust our loading and our expectation for and a we continue through the of you and well go to the next please with is next Capital for taking my and Ill echo the congrats on the good want to follow back up on a prior OpEx and how do you about managing it gotten the two year in a row on why RD a a percent of revenue is low it bottomed in grown it faster than revenue do you about over the next or two Is there a particular percentage managing it to is it a function of where you can get margin are you thinking about it then if you can about where deploying these new resource at of a at a foot talked in the about our total OpEx fluctuate between and of revenue meaning in weaker market we might be running at the higher end of in stronger market well run at the lower end of here in the last of year been around the middle of pack around of of a highlevel at OpEx a a whole Now more specifically on RD when it come to allocating capital and RD is certainly a place where we allocate some of capital to it a important for any management team to pay attention to take it extremely seriously to make when we do allocate to RD well allocate in area we believe we can actually develop differentiated product with very long revenue stream and very high margin opportunity idea is to maximize the amount of revenue we get on the RD dollar spent it not a percent per se were trying to manage to an opportunity were after a we talked about earlier in the call some of our RD spending is actually moving up a bit even these few quarter and to continue to move up in the next few quarter a we are seeing opportunity to reallocate some of our resource from where they have been into development area for RD purpose extend the overall availability of our product into new marketplace we at opportunistically and not based upon a particular model or a percent of revenue or anything of Do you have a followon Capital switching gear to the auto market Theres been concern all but the data point have been stronger than not your perspective on market a you go into in term of inventory and the strength you saw more a function of unit or it more content gain through of whats driving the market we believe is content gain if you have visited an auto showroom any in the last obvious to see with the new model are coming out belief is the automotive sale fluctuate much they have in the and into the future certainly overall the content gain is whats growing thing a when we at the automotive market were making investment produce revenue year and year and year out into the future If thing were to weaken in market and we to be next or five year from now when but we how to handle those type of situation tactically it wont change our investment level and what we believe be the driver for our and the industry over the next year and year hope helped well go to the next please come from with of of you for taking my have a on your Embedded versus margin how much of delta is at a margin and how much is at an OpEx intensity if it on a margin what lever do you have Is it you can move a greater proportion of these product to millimeter trying to get a for how much improvement you can make in Embedded margin without necessarily depending on sale growth would we disclosed for by the revenue and the operating profit and we dig into too many detail underneath a to whats happened between the line would the at the margin obviously it benefit from our continued effort to lower our manufacturing cost clearly happening there from an OpEx standpoint we have been reducing OpEx for a year up through about of last OpEx now mostly at the we want it at it is a of being able to drive revenue growth and get leverage off the OpEx we have leverage then fall straight through to cash flow which is a direct benefit of course to our shareholder based upon the formula talked about with capital management how we tend to at it a opposed to trying to force a model on it the two segment being comparable we at what they can actually generate bottom line of Do you have a followon of maybe you could help u quantify how much of your sale are on millimeter now and how much of your Embedded sale are on millimeter you of we talked about in our capital management call we ended last with about of our revenue which were roughly about in on millimeter so approximately of revenue when you at factory where were building it we call it it our Richardson Fab or we call it RFAB for short Thatll support of revenue when it completely full if you at one of the reason why we believe our manufacturing and technology is one of the competitive advantage is because is significantly larger than any of our competitor of scale doesnt make for them beyond RFAB and qualified our millimeter factory we creatively called sits a le than a mile from the office were currently in can we did qualify at the end of last a we were anticipating and we have revenuegenerating wafer are running through factory well update next on our capital management call where we stand on overall utilization intention is to build more product of there but well wait until then to update it a different part of your talking about is shared with Embedded Processing in fact so is where some of the Embedded Processing millimeter production occurs at of great you well go to the next please next be with you guess the have is hoping you can comment a bit on what customer are telling you these day a it relates to the consolidation the industry is seeing mean are they coming to you and perhaps asking you to get into certain business assume they must be a bit concerned about there being le and le supplier if some of those discussion have already happened with your customer only we had a conversation with our customer about consolidation when we acquired National Semiconductor and at point in we had a lot of customer congratulate u and pleased we were doing it because they knew we were friendly with term Aside from cannot point to any example of a customer coming to u and saying anything about the consolidation on in the industry and what they we should be doing about it of and Ill add to If you of the model were trying to put together it not focused on one customer or one or two product where if you saw consolidation a an OEM you might have significant concern and maybe go to one of those company competitor to a large extent why we have those overall concern a you the market continues to be extremely fragmented both from a customer base a well a supplier even with the consolidation have a followup helpful a followup back to the nearterm environment so you talked about the sellthroughs being a bit better than expected Do you basically customer being too conservative do you customer are actually seeing strengthening in demand on their end of would overall were operating in a similar macro environment to what in actually recent year and an environment it if used one word to describe it not strong not weak and were operating in type of environment the benefit of u having consignment and having consignment with distribution is our revenue more closely match demand doesnt mean they cant change quickly in the future at some point but certainly were shipping what we believe or what we for on portion of demand is or those shipment is very very close to actual demand and consumption you with for one more from with you so much guess had two of all can you a bit about Brexit it seems not seeing any impact from it but can you a bit about whether you saw any perturbation around it any stint sort of what might worry you with anything around Brexit would we it much impossible for u to be able to make a comment directly on Indications Ive the British economy is about of the global GDP so even if there a wobble economy it to be hard for u to be able to detect it would what we do see is our customer are global They sell globally and it a larger macro environment were in a a few minute macro environment been and we believe continue to be relatively slow and so it up to u to execute a best we can of it to gain market share of follow Got it then yeah yeah then back to personal electronics to ask it sort of a bit of a different way you last call it would be a le of a headwind in the than it in and it sound it le of a yearoveryear headwind you commit at least to it being even le of a headwind in the calendar guess the reason why ask is because it a big hockey stick a this all normalizes so trying to sort of figure out when hockey stick is to of wont try to get granular on any one customer or any one market in providing a forecast Ill typically and what we saw last certainly PE had a very strong back half right we saw the demand weaken very very late in the so a headwind yearonyear the last two quarter a we described wont put together a forecast for you in the half but point out we did have a very strong half last of hope help a bit with we wrap up and you for joining u of this call is on our you today call do you for your',\n",
       "       'you go to the line of go ahead you and excellent result you give u a bit more color on whats driving the revenue in by endmarket typically provide a forecast by endmarket if there any large shift well about you much we did last within a in personal electronics can demand we would expect to grow but it be down significantly from a also outside of we would expect the rest of our to grow both and over yeah yeah the conversation to millimeter been an important part of the improvement in margin profile and wondering if you could update u on how much of the portfolio is converted to and how much is left Ill go ahead and to Roughly a of our revenue generated on millimeter last have total internal capability about so were using about a of capability at this point in to everyone else who listening the reason the millimeter is so important to u is the economics at the factory get about time a many chip per wafer on a millimeter versus the millimeter wafer processing cost is about time a much if you do the math mean the actual die cost is only about a much on a millimeter a a millimeter wafer you of take all the way through to finished good all thing being equal we wind up with a higher margin on those chip to manufacture millimeter increasingly important to u we out in the future again about of growth capacity in millimeter and we continue to increase our loading in space fact on a yearoveryear we actually had more start on millimeter than a Ill add to Kevins comment a we reported last we qualified our millimeter fab which is DMOS and we do have product running in fab you go to the next please Ill take our next from the line of go ahead your line is open good afternoon Solid a always guess could you a bit about the embedded processing op margin improvement If memory serf me correct when you out of the wireless you didnt get out of all the cost and you put a lot of cost into the embedded processing market If at sort of the incremental margin op margin it greater than Are we sort of at a tipping point here with of the incremental op margin we should start to see about this is there any reason why the embedded op margin shouldnt converge with the op margin over might recall for the we were still in the process of winding up some restructuring item in the embedded processing finished about the middle of the bled over into the middle of the Inaudible now were seeing the benefit of those cost restructurings margin improvement well see inaudible solid operating profit a and much closer to what we expect from you noted we had about over about a pullthrough ph to operating profit from the revenue growth a we go the focus of division be primarily on very solid cost containment and cost management but a lot of energy on growing the top line and growing revenue it can continue to drop through more profit a we go wont attempt to characterize whether or not it achieves the same sort of level a but we are confident there remains room of improvement in overall PL primarily from continued cost containment and a drive towards revenue growth mentioned a my followup you mentioned in your comment some of the inventory growth you saw in the of how long it take to get back closer to trend a you exit would you expect to see day closer to your trend line or how should we about whats actually interesting is our dollar of inventory are actually down over a we mentioned in the remark our day of inventory were up and up on the expectation of increased shipment in the plus there a few extra day are inventory a a result of the slowdown in personal electronics we mentioned day expect material is to ship over the balance of the between the increased shipment in and the shipment of personal electronics material well see the day of inventory drift back down comfortably our model very similar to what we saw last If you go back and take a last we were also a bit higher in the anticipation of growth and then day drifted down a we came through the you well go to the next please take our next from go ahead Participant is Charles ph on for guide at the midpoint flat to down yearoveryear growth of wondering when you expect to of return to growth and what the driver of be if you at the midpoint right the yearoveryear growth would be down about we talked about before we on a yearoveryear well still have the growth impacted due to the weakness of personal electronics Outside of we expect to see our business growing both and on and again were on a good position to capitalize on the trend of industrial and automotive longer where the growth in our industry from a a reminder we had last about of our revenue driven by there we feel good with where our product are positioned Participant Got it then margin performance strong if you want Outside of lower depreciation and incremental millimeter revenue where are the other factor are to drive upside from here you hit two important one we have lower manufacturing cost over driven by a you mentioned lower depreciation and increased millimeter wafer start we also had a retromix of overall product mentioned in his remark industrial up very solidly for u and in the industrial space we enjoy a very nice mix of overall profitability you have combination of event on again to Daves comment a moment a we continue to see content growth in industrial and automotive we would expect to continue to see an improvement on our mix from a profitability standpoint too a we out over the quarter and year it all coming together very nicely for u right now great you well go to our next please next come from the line of go ahead for taking my question the OpEx came in a higher wondering if you could tell u the driver what drove and what your thought are for OpEx for OpEx did in a bit higher than what we had planned for wasnt any one drove Theres a number of small thing were being taken care of in the we into recall includes about two month worth of our annual pay and benefit increase If you into youll need to account for we would have the full three month of pay and benefit increase expect the change to to be very similar to what you saw last Got it you helpful my followup wanted to dig a bit into the comm infrastructure impact on both embedded processing a well a others embedded dropped over noted within your other your ASIC custom ASICs are down over both of those tend to be driven very highly by comm infrastructure you help u understand the differential between those two business Is one of them eating the other for example me about our embedded our embedded a you remember three product line of it Microcontrollers and processor are both about of revenue and connectivity make up about of revenue we saw growth in all three of those business they all grew very nicely it led by processor our communication infrastructure processor would be of but we also sell automotive product are of drove growth in the other the custom ASIC Ill we saw a different mix of product to customer so it not always the same some customer where we only sell both embedded and into those customer and this is a reminder longer we do expect the custom ASIC decline because functionality is being absorbed into our SOCs of the embedded so you you go to the next please next come from go ahead Capital for taking my you about the outperformance in margin millimeter what the utilization rate are a you into it seems guidance implies of sustaining at want to make right and what expecting to do with utilization there the utilization actually havent changed much in a number of quarter and we expect it to change much in the next or two either amount of wafer were starting are consistent a we go across the quarter you can of see in when our day of inventory is up in were building for increased shipment in allows u to run the factory at close to similar utilization over rather than ramping them up and down to meet inquarter demand wouldnt expect utilization to change much into the next of quarter a it hasnt in the last number of quarter Capital Got you then my followup you had a correction in consumer a you pointed out you into the back half of the you you expected to sell through do you expect your content in those type of ph application to be roughly similar this and therefore you should see a similar ramp you did last we havent given color on how much content we have Ill when we do engage where we to be able to engage of personal electronics those type of product well sell across multiple generation of product and not always the case on every product we make an investment in but where we want to steer our investment dollar were confident a we build inventory well have demand in the back half wont try to predict at this point what demand so you and good to the next please next come from the site of go ahead good afternoon for taking my Another solid showing by the embedded pointed out particular strength in processor you talked about comms a a driver there and maybe some automotive your MCU product also grew nicely over you can give u some insight on the endmarketapplications drove the growth in subsegment our MCU is a great were building a you been investing in for some and continued to invest both in TIbased architecture a well a ARMbased architecture and customer want to have both of those we continue to be selective on where we make those investment of the you the way you differentiate those product is by having peripheral are optimized for different type of application developed microcontrollers are targeted for ultralowpower batterybacked operation thatll be infielded for in some case decade a well a very highperformancebased microcontrollers so very strong connectivity solution both wired but a well a wireless cross over into our connectivity there and we support over a dozen different interface or wireless standard of again very very broadbased and we are encouraged by the result of have a followon in the industrial market which obviously an area of strength for you in the you have talked previously about servicing different subsegments so very broad Youre correct also talked about content gain in industrial which is of a similar dynamic to the automotive of those subsegments within industrial are showing more of a bias towards more dollar content gain on a goforward the one nice about automotive is we can more easily identify what unit SAR growth is and there enough analyst follow market we can track with the semiconductor content gain there we there somewhere around on average sell into an automotive a number been growing very nicely at about of the average sale price of a car so it not too hard to imagine number continue to grow and grow significantly over the future you contrast to industrial and we were in the very early stage of maybe where we were three five year in the automotive market with industrial you cant do same type of analysis unfortunately because different sector we sell into Underneath there are literally hundred of different end equipment we track and develop solution for there a very very wide variety of application we can see it on the beauty of it is it not one is a growth on a very broad reflected in our number not only this but it been reflected in the number for a number of quarter now we to opportunity in the future you well move on to the next please next come from the line of go ahead of for taking my more on margin Is the the new baseline and we should model the flowthrough from this or are there any mix benefit are helping you in the half might reverse when the smartphone shipment start to ramp in the half youll have several thing on across a tough call to make and more to get too precise would expect industrial and automotive to continue to be a growing portion of our revenue over where were focusing our attention especially RD dollar also expect more start a we out into the future proportionately more start on millimeter which is lower cost wafer would also expect the depreciation and decline been seeing this to continue albeit at a slower pace than what in the last few quarter those give you tailwind so even if you do have some of these other product start back up inaudible mix on there these margin were operating at right now are representative of what the portfolio can do for our shareholder of Got it Inaudible a my followup you mentioned sale growth in plus what guiding to excluding recall whether you personal electronics or your largest customer sale growth is actually up on you help u quantify what growth trend is versus last were not being precise wanted to give some color generally you where we had headwind and the demand changing late in the portion of our demand of personal electronics we expect it grow but be down significantly over we havent gotten more precise than so you well move on to the next please next come from the line of go ahead for me ask the guess the would be your came in at the high end of the you about what the positive surprise in the maybe associated with in the you have given sequential endmarket performance to match what given and then over if help to answer both question be great again a we had earlier portion of demand where we saw weakness came in about a we expected strength more broadbased and we continue to obviously to see strength in automotive and then the improvement in industrial and comms equipment very very broadbased strength we saw the part of your What we saw from the trend there no surprise automotive very strong and it driven by infotainment a well a the hybrid electric and powertrain system Industrial again we had growth across almost every of industrial Personal electronics down with most sector declining comms equipment up and the in a row it actually grew then enterprise system up due to projector did you have a followon Ill make it quick you talked about the comms side the in a row it been up Generally how do you about versus where we are after earning a ton of inventory and now coming back are we to the point where were shipping to enddemand and then now we can grow or shrink with or is there some other dynamic on you repeat the part of the you cut out a bit on our side sorry you your comms actually up for the in a row Right had fallen due to the endmarket before the is do you back to shipping to enddemand and what do you view to be the growth trajectory of longer Yup you you would you a you always choppy and we had a very strong of growth back a followed by decline we saw last you it tough to be able to predict whats to happen in market we positioned product and inventory to be able to respond if demand continue to strengthen if it doesnt we how to react in environment too it still continues to be a good for u continue to make investment in it we itll be choppy Longer we view it a a market be a growth operator take their CapEx spending up over the next year we do there continue to be shift in how they spend money we continue to make investment where we believe growth be in the future you very much and well move to the next please take our next from the site of go ahead apologize if these question have been asked before on here late listening to Zylex ph slamming my head against my desk sound guiding for a roughly seasonal slightly below seasonal environment If you could of compare now versus a versus a or the last six month how you feel overall about the overall environment Is it seasonal a below seasonal better than seasonal getting better getting worse comment there make the observation we believe were continuing to operate in a very similar macroenvironment in the last few quarter and even in the recent year our guidance obviously is our best estimate of how well perform we try to stay away from making any precise comment on what a seasonal look you because if you at the number there usually a wide variation on what an average would tell you it would be again very similar macroenvironment to what have a followup Real quick on channel inventory and distribution inventory you channel inventory up a of day around week Do you expect channel inventory or disti inventory to go up again in then if you could give u of the channel inventorydisti inventory been in for the last call it two or three year is this basically the bottom or a off the bottom or closer to the peak or where would be a you several year implemented our consignment program so we still continue to learn what the right in in the channel be if we could actually convert all of our shipment and distribution to consignment and carry inventory ourselves wed actually prefer to do if anything wed encourage our distributor to take advantage of those program operated around four week to week for some number you somewhere in even if it drifted up a bit it always depends on the product out there and the speed at which it turn other peer measure the inventory in month and not week were very you efficient on how we use channel it work out well for both of u and our distributor partner we feel very good about where is overall you and well go to the next please next come from go ahead Capital a lot afternoon guess from me the lower depreciation helped you on the margin about point over Do you magnitude can sustain throughout calendar or should we about depreciation dollar to be more of a flat inaudible made a comment a few minute the rate of depreciation decline we have over the is slow down meaningfully a we go into Recall from a capital spending standpoint our model is to spend about of our revenue on CapEx which we have been doing for the last of year and we expect to continue this depreciation run more than so clearly theyll have to converge at some point depreciable life on most of our equipment is five year you may recall it about five year when we brought on several new factory one in Izu ph some equipment to be brought in to our fab here in the Dallas area and a factory we bought in China so were seeing those depreciation occurrence roll down now the rate of the decline we saw over the last few quarter this slow down although it still decline a we go into Capital Got it if follow up you have about a dollar of debt due in the of Is the thought process to pay off with cash on hand and roll it and what would implication have for your interest expense line a you go if we pay it off the interest expense clearly decline expect well do what done similarly in the last of cycle on this where we have if the interest rate are favorable by the we go back into the market well likely pay off a portion and roll the balance into a new issue either case whether we pay off the entire amount or pay off a portion roll over the balance would expect interest cost decline by several dollar a you well go to the next please go ahead your line is open you Silicon Valley up over and mean better than the industry better than your peer Was mainly due to industrial and automotive strength or were there some shared gain all the thing on there SVA have a good exposure to both industrial and automotive and certainly helped a my followup for do you have a CapEx number for u for this or should we take of whatever revenue we up with keep it simple take of your expected revenue number and to be close to what were spending right Sounds good job you you go to the next please well go next to the line of go ahead Capital you had a on the automotive we havent talked about the momentum you seem to be witnessing here Big sizable bigger than your peer and after the rest of the it boring but it grows the had where are the new opportunity you are now designed if we were to at where automotive to a of year what should we be thinking over the next of year you automotive were building continues to be very very broadbased strong in both a well a embedded Inside of embedded both processor and microcontrollers a well a even some connectivity design of an standpoint it actually is very very broadbased one of the thing been focused on is broadening the number of unit the participates in automotive if you went back five ten year we might have had one or two unit participating in marketplace out of our or so different unit over half of them actually ship product into marketplace it very very broadbased five what we call sector make up the automotive market again the largest one is not more than midsingledigit a a percentage of our revenue last they are the five segment are infotainment and cluster inaudible safety advanced driver assist system or ADAS a it known body electronics which also includes lighting and then the hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain growth across all of those sector very very robust growth and a very broad ph you have a followon Capital it for me you for one more take our final from the line of go ahead sir great for squeezing me in around the middle of last the you highlighted the potential for a customer and maybe wed been sort of dancing around this point but wonder if you expect customer repeat at a similar magnitude in this a projection wont make on today call they and all of our customer team work very very hard to get product designed into with largest customer a we talked about before we sell them hundred of product we participate in all of their major platform of course the revenue would always be skewed where they ship their product and theyve publicly reported about twothirds of their revenue would be in phone our revenue mirror those type of shipment good growth in automotive were seeing strengthening and broad strengthening of industrial a trend well see how those trend continue for the balance of the Theres a lot of between now and the end of the then well see what happens of personal electronics a well so have a followon Will one on capacity if can wondering if you acquired any capacity a you do periodically and if there any update on the planned fab closure in Scotland Ill go ahead and answer one have been we continue to acquire capacity new factory here lately but we do continue to pick up equipment quite expensive new for good price when you buy them the way we buy them it relates to the closure of the factory in Scotland a a reminder we expect factory not close before the end of a it been with other factory in the when we close those thing they either take a of year you slowly do lifetime build on the inventory and on certain other part of those factory youll recall other existing factory a multiyear effort it progressing a plan and we again expect it to actually complete until about the end of you very much Will you all for joining u of this call is on our Wed to everybody for their feel to your line at any',\n",
       "       'you well go to our from with you divulge to u the market on personal electronics is causing all the weakness if it is handset which doesnt a a huge surprise also comment on the other end market especially PCs where some of the other semiconductor company have talked about a bit of weakening in PCs and what you are seeing in end market and of where we saw the weakness you were guessing is mobile phone and we did see weaken late in the in the back half of the of If take and at for the how our end market did Ill put into perspective Ill start with an area of strength in automotive grew in the mid teen Most of the sector of growing growing doubledigits Industrial revenue about even for the and we had about half of the sector there were increasing offset by the others Personal electronics a talked about grew singledigits Ill note we had certainly growth in one customer grew significantly but primarily offset by decline in others therefore our percentage of our revenue in personal electronics didnt change too much went from last to this Communications equipment down primarily driven by wireless infrastructure and down around for the then finally enterprise system down slightly due to projector with a we talked about earlier in our remark outside of one area of weakness everything else came in about a we had expected would be inclusive of PCs and the other area you talked about have a follow on go next to with and of if you have go ahead USA to follow up you talked about Apple being an customer for the full wondering if you could about the linearity of percentage a the progressed Did they exit the a a larger customer a you about the weakness in in smartphones do you feel at a build significantly below sellthrough so represent a bottom in weakness how do you handicap and of so our revenue profile of personal electronics obviously be more back halfweighted customer did well in the marketplace obviously our revenue would be reflective of could point out we sell very diverse set of product to customer and in fact hundred of product to it and product in every major platform the revenue of customer reported to be somewhere around twothirds of it is in smartphones and youd expect since a diverse position across the customer our revenue would be very similar and certainly whenever you have a fairly significant change in demand of any customer their supply chain consideration where different piece of inventory sitting of supply chain we happen to be on the beginning part of supply chain wont try to handicap where is where we the demand in in and well see make a prediction on later might add on demand profile did discus we expect about yearoveryear decline attributable to this particular in personal electronics rest be about even with last and of Right good point do you have a followup USA to followup on the rest of the even from last there clearly a lot of investor angst about the macro in general clearly if you at your profile throughout and excluded Apple you saw some weakness in the rest of your starting in the Youd had a of quarter of yearoveryear decline in total revenue even a personal electronics done strongly so when you at the macro concern are out there do you feel been fully reflected in the number and now coming out of this how do you handicap our macro concern onto your forwardlooking guidance at the highest we were continuing to operate in a relatively weak macro economy a we have been for the last of year nothing terribly exciting in the economy a a whole If we of at the comparison were talking about recall a we were seeing sharp decline occurring in communication infrastructure and were also seeing some stiff headwind in the form of foreign exchange where if the rate of exchange moving against u from the dollar strength standpoint despite when you take a at all we actually see aside from this one of personal electronics the balance of it to be about even on a yearoveryear again the headline were seeing on the macro front and a lot of the angst you mentioned certainly sound real but actually from a demand signal standpoint from our customer it consistent with what continue to operate in a weak macro environment with lot of cross current on Again last year weakening in comms infrastructure very strong auto foreign exchange issue we were dealing with we see where those thing are coming into play right now and of and Ill add of weak macro economy the diversity of our product and the model we continue to operate extremely well of environment you and well go to the next please take our next from and of for me ask the follow up thought you had something against short people a quick one so a you mentioned it of a flat environment still managed to grow earnings in in if thing are flat to down maybe about some of the leverage you have or would pull to try and keep earnings flat or could we see earnings be down again excuse me be down in this there a lot of assumption there me you a to the moving part are on here you can spot it if you take a at the release we put out there the most apparent number you can see on there is the decline in depreciation beginning to occur clearly from an accounting standpoint increase our profit margin and fall through to EPS depreciation continue it glide path down in consistent with the fact a lot of those purchase we made five year are now reaching the end of their depreciable life addition to were seeing a growing portion of our chip being produced in our millimeter capacity and a you it cost u about le per chip or about le per device to manufacture on millimeter versus millimeter a mix improves also fall through to the bottom line then the element point out is we continue to see a mix shift in the source of revenue into industrial and automotive which tend to have higher overall margin and certainly stickier revenue margin profile over collectively those should help our overall margin and earnings performance notwithstanding whatever direction revenue take u through over the next month addition to from an EPS standpoint a we have been doing for eleven year now a long a the intrinsic value of the is higher than the market value we continue to be buyer of share reduced our share count this certainly at current price it say we should continue to be active accumulator of share combined we certainly would have momentum in our favor notwithstanding a significant change in our revenue profile to continue to help u with earnings per share and of Right so much sorry about the difficulty there operator we can go to the next please take our next from with for me ask a why we continue with the topic you talked about a far a earnings driver OpEx continues to impress for the in a row OpEx dropped by you had some closure in Japan et cetera If we were to on OpEx are there any unique driver such a closing business are to impact how should we about OpEx relative to sale guess the way answer is there are no nob on the horizon right now of any measure were similar to what in the last of year you pointed out we had some restructuring action we took in Japan and also in certain part of Embedded Processing over the last two year and those have removed quite a bit of OpEx cost those are about done now They much finished up in the middle of last we what we would expect to see is what talked about in the our OpEx should operate somewhere between and of revenue a weak market it might be pushing a reasonably strong market it might be pushing were in the low right now for again a see any real material change to the OpEx profile you we do always have a seasonal pattern in our OpEx OpEx down to because of holiday such a Thanksgiving and Christmas OpEx be up again in versus because of the absence of those holiday and also the annual pay and benefit increase we instituted across the in the to of give you some parameter on it in the to increase to on OpEx and of comment on do the communication equipment side of thing you mentioned it down about not a huge surprise mentioned the wireless cause of you a bit about what did in the and what sort of outlook do you have for it heading into and of if you at it down around mid teen but from a it down mid teen but actually did see some growth the in a row we had growth of there continues to be one over the last of decade been very very choppy characteristic probable wont change were on a position where a of quarter of growth when we at it longer we do believe carrier CapEx wont grow certainly wont drop to zero either we do it get smaller slightly in well go to the next please go next to with of of you for taking my last you expanded margin by about point which is very impressive given the flat the macro environment if had asked you a where would margin go given all the lever right because it moved from to millimeter the lower depreciation the mix shift towards industrial and automotive do you you would have thought margin would be even stronger than right what you might have than what you actually achieved my is a we what is a bigger driver of margin Is it top line growth and wafer start or do you still to millimeter move is being underappreciated in term of a margin driver off me make the scorekeeping on correctly here were talking about point of improvement this of Sorry yes Dont want to miss out on extra there into clearly any meaningful revenue growth incrementally have a much stronger impact than any other piece of the PL on improving overall margin independent of margin growth go back to what talked about a few minute on Rosss and would be the increasing mix improvement on millimeter the mix to industrial and auto and then the decline in depreciation a we continue to march through tough to handicap which one would be the biggest contributor or how to sequence those they all collectively be quite meaningful a we move into and well pleasantly please ourselves again for another and of and Ill add to on essentially flat revenue all of came down to cash flow growing by right there some thing on with accounting rule of on the margin line but were focused on growing margin or on the cash flow growth specifically and it clocked in nicely a well you have a follow on of is on your Other where you have the DLP and calculator and ASICs down about if ignore the legacy wireless piece it down so much and how should we about in you and of if you for the it down not if your for the or for the actually the same reason down primarily due to custom ASIC product If you remember those product have a very high exposure to wireless infrastructure and where we saw the headwind also down because DLP and DLP had a very good in so very very difficult compare on front because there a strong World Cup demand pulling through DLP of how to about it for and of so if you last in the mid teen If you go back several year it actually been in same Previous year were primarily driven from the exit of the wireless a we go into next and a we essentially some longterm growth potential of DLP calculator have been flat to slightly down and we would continue to expect to see Growth in royalty royalty have been about of our revenue and wed expect them to continue to run in area then ASIC shift over into our Embedded Processing a we pick up functionality wed expect mid teen to slow somewhere in the mid to low single decline you well go ahead and move on to the next please go next to with afternoon for taking my the strength in your Embedded in you also had a good growth in the a well focused on the MCU product here you help u understand what are the end market and trend have been driving the strength here in the MCU biz assuming most of it auto and industrial but love to get your insight and of so when you at the Embedded if for the the increase due to connectivity and microcontrollers both of those product line would have a very diverse customer footprint and so there not one or market driving it Collectively right in industrial a well a automotive but a bias to industrial because of the diversity of those customer and where theyre winning design very very broad based and part of the reason why were encouraged with and the growth also you see how contributes to the bottom line and the profitability of or for the for color and of Have a followon your broad catalog it a high margin the team done a good job of continuing to improve the breadth and the access to the portfolio guess the is did the catalog outgrow the overall in and do you expect it to outperform overall this a well and of so we have our so much lined up by catalog or not the majority of the product by number certainly are more catalogbased a ten of thousand of product were not quite organized way mean the four business of the high volume and logic which be more applicationspecific product even there even though theyre applicationspecific many of those product are to multiple customer and even sometimes multiple market even though theyre applicationspecific Something motor driver a an example sell into multiple market and multiple sector power and then high performance and SVA we have a cut between you well go to our next please go next to with Capital United States you very much and wanted to go back to the overall environment and in the you have been very good about giving u essentially sign post metric if remember correctly rate of cancellation and a few others you please u what those metric are telling you about the overall health of then had a quick follow up and of a we at our and a mentioned before we believe been operating in a weaker environment and continue from some had some people ask u if we a semiconductor cycle is underlying what were seeing and we havent those sign of a traditional cycle there are thing our lead time continue to remain short cancellation remain very low distribution inventory continues to hold around week we continue to deliver our product on to our customer when theyre asking at very very high service level those are some of the bigger one to mind you would see some movement if you were moving through a bottom or a top of the cycle and we havent in quite some Capital United States Makes then my follow up on the industrial obviously pay attention to the quarterquarter but on a fullyear if recall what the number you gave u it flat for the the before it up given it such a cornerstone of your also your margin expansion how do you explain the flat yearoveryear last and then what do you industrial should do in you and of yeah before about industrial want to those may not be a familiar with u when we about our industrial market it something very broad and different than what a typical investor would from an industrial screen sector make up industrial and theyll include thing factory automation medical and healthcare building automation grid infrastructure test measurement motor drive electronic point of sale space and avionics display power delivery appliance lighting industrial transportation and then a bucket of everything else go into it slightly or very different than what most people would of in industrials right it had a strong the before when we started the we had expected it to be stronger than what it turned out typically a lot of people ask u hey we hear the rumor in China see the stock they follow maybe in the industrial are seeing very very very weak demand we turned in revenue consistent with what we saw after a very strong fundamentally what we think on of is there more semiconductor content into the industrial market and we were in the very early stage of if you at the automotive market it much easier to see content because we how many car ship per much easier to see the difference between total SAAR unit growth and what the semiconductor are shipping into it Certainly impossible to be able to see of the industrial market because it very very broad and very very diverse we believe a decade or more of runway of increasing content of the industrial market about all the insight can share on you and well go on to the next please go next to Rolland with Billings Ramsey Jackson Rolland Capital for the and excuse me if this already been asked If you could give u a bit more detail on the Scottish fab and what being made there and how large footprint and then also what of OpEx opportunity you might have there the fab in Greenock Scotland is one came to u with the acquisition of National Semiconductor in Most of the part are manufactured in there are part of our Silicon Valley announced we are to were putting together plan to wind down operation there and move the production to other millimeter fabs we have in Germany Japan and Maine in the These are larger more cost effective more technologically advanced factory can give u a lot better economics with those chip are produced there take u about three year to wind down those operation by our estimate right now a it take much to requalify those part into other factory at the end of we no longer have an operation in Greenock took a charge in the a we began planning for activity and we expect well continue to incur roughly of charge per each through the end of a we wind it down for total charge of about over a three Jackson Rolland Capital one more followup there not any opportunity to move to millimeter then also a we at Embedded we concentrated a bit on MCUs but maybe we can about connectivity and why up yearoveryear the growth in MCU yearonyear at all change your penchant in MA towards Embedded versus your favorite and are to have to tag team one Ill finish off the Scottish fab one the why not millimeter Short answer is most of those process are dual qualed already in other millimeter factory and it a whole lot easier to transfer into a qualified process already existing in other factory Not all but enough of them so consequently well go ahead and put those into open capacity in millimeter factory versus bringing them into you want to take the and of your on connectivity whats driving the growth there a very broad portfolio of product we support about a dozen different standard from a connectivity standpoint so low power Bluetooth to WiFi to other subgigahertz standard so if somebody want to connect something we have a solution we can offer them so were seeing good uptake of the product there you rolled in a about it change our penchant for acquisition Again our belief is when you acquire a in the Embedded space picking up additional architecture and additional architecture doesnt make you stronger it make you bigger so well continue to for company have characteristic much a National If we when we are interested and the profile of the type of me add too on the Greenock facility we do expect to save about once completed all the transition on an annualized and once we do complete the transition of the product to the more costeffective fabs and well move on to the next please go next to with for taking the and wanted to ask a followup on some of the millimeter point were made can you help me understand where in the portfolio on a and subsegment the is having the most success with the millimeter transition and therefore whats left to go a you at the opportunity is it a fairly steady opportunity or are there some discontinuity hemming in your ability to move product over to the benefit is happening right now in the portfolio and it happened across all four of the unit of it millimeter factor we have in our fab being highly automated somewhat counterintuitively you have to have highvolume part running through there because the automation we can actually run relatively lowvolume part through there and still gain significant cost benefit what the way been employing the millimeter strategy is not so much to requal existing into factory but instead to release new product into factory on already qualified process the focus had and it continue well give a further update a to our progress to date on both the runner fab a well a the fab were converting we announced last coming on on our capital management call stay tuned for give a new update on a well you and then switching gear on the competitive front of competitor in the MCU have recently announced theyll be getting together Thoughts on the implication for your ability to continue to grow and take operating margin in Embedded from the mid higher if there a more consolidated landscape out there you and of go ahead and of to obviously competed with both of those company for a of decade and them combining together doesnt change much from a competitive landscape we believe our four competitive attribute make u unique theyre hard to replicate stay focused on those and those are our approach to manufacturing the breadth of our product portfolio the reach of the market channel and our diverse and longlived position what well stay focused on those and we those have helped u gain share and theyll help u continue to gain share for one more please go next to with Sterne Agee Sterne Agee CRT for taking my guess if could focus in on the fact you did report Apple a a customer you maybe about your expectation for the full in term of content did mention in many different device but on a for device there do you believe holding content increasing content guidance you can give u and maybe how we should about being seasonally the impact on seasonality and of we wont provide color at on a customer overall if you at how Apple impacted our with their success in the marketplace personal electronics about of revenue in If you at the market overall if you take memory out personal electronics is around of the market so we have about half of the exposure there we try to find place where some differentiation where we believe those product last more than one cycle Perhaps theyre product we developed we can use in other customer or even in other market in some case what well stay focused on overall do you have a followon Sterne Agee CRT do actually for Looking at you mentioned depreciation ramping down you give u a of how quickly Ive you running at about a rate for the but your CapEx believe around quickly should we see those number merge together to see CapEx and depreciation cross over before the end of Depreciation continue to run down during the of gentle rollover you saw begin to occur in is your best proxy for how to model and of you and you all for joining u Again please plan to join u for our capital management call on at am Central Time of this call is on our today you for your',\n",
       "       'you well take our from with of line is now open of you for taking my guess for the one a when you demand weak but the revenue strong and then you mentioned industrial you even on but stronger than you expected If you could give u some more color around the demand environment because you have such wide exposure what is better or worse versus three month and what it mean demand is weak but your revenue is strong of what we were saying is if you our revenue declined from a and we obviously would describe a a weak demand actually similar to what we saw last of certainly it stronger than what we had expected were a of area were stronger than we had expected Wireless infrastructure and industrial were both stronger than what we had expected what were trying to continue to operate in what we would consider to be a weaker macroeconomic environment and where we came in Do you have a followup of margin understand they were sort of flattish because assume you took some utilization down why are they sort of flat to down versus last assume throughout this there been a mix shift towards your core AnalogEmbedded market and a mix shift guess towards more millimeter capacity why arent margin up versus last the short answer is our wafer start were down in the versus last and also versus last and so underutilization a bit higher than it a of you well go to the next please next come from with line is now open USA good afternoon on the strong result to followup on margin comment utilization went down in the saying to update u on your inventory target but the one outstanding right now is about to and you there quickly of how do about utilization into the and what of impact should expect on the margin line a we into the were expecting our wafer start be roughly flat to what they were this so no significant change in start there keep in mind the wafer we start in other than for the few week of the are mostly for what we expect in followon quarter we build quite a bit to our expectation of when inventory actually get sold USA helpful then a my followup you were one of the to start the trend of MA with the acquisition of National several year back Theres been a lot of speculation in the marketplace about more MA within the semi space talked about this in the but of be about of getting some updated thought from your perspective about the advantage from here given your alreadyhefty scale of MA and how you are sort of thinking about guess itll take me a to of go through those thought there Of course we acquired National back into so we ahead of the game versus where people are at we spent the intervening driving hard to accelerate four attribute we in combination are unique to and differentiate u quite a bit from our competitor which may in fact be impacting some of their thinking about how they approach their market those four attribute are our approach to lowcost manufacturing and advanced technology the sheer breadth of our overall product portfolio the reach we have to our customer through our market channel especially with arguably the largest sale force of anybody out there and the diversity and longlived position we enjoy in the market with the product we have we at what most company are doing from an MA front it appears some of them may be changing their focus and some of them may be trying to build scale already have what we believe is a significant scale advantage and we believe were focused on the two best opportunity are out there being and Embedded Processing those two reason arent motivating u to differently about MA we do about MA our approach is to focus on the right strategic fit one can generate longterm return and excess cash flow we do focus on the number acquisition might lead u to by strategic fit talking our bias is towards If we were to at an acquisition it would be a to be broad in catalog have a diverse customer base have a large percentage of it revenue coming from industrial and automotive have a very talented RD team Those would be the sort of attribute wed at from a strategic standpoint a return standpoint wed at several metric including making the return on our investment is accretive to our weighted average cost of capital within four year or so we also want to make whatever we acquire can continue to expand our cash flow with all and we take a at whats out there we have been actually buying our favorite semiconductor you to hear it way but through our own stock buyback by buying back those share were getting a cash flow yield on those acquisition of those share and we have any integration risk and no banker fee a whole lot easier way to run the and focus on customer of you well go to the next please next come from with the line is now open for taking my question my to follow up on the industrial market half of your market were of up over half of them were down similar to the same a last but you do seem to be seeing upside versus expectation industrial can you give u some idea of which end market actually seeing relative strength versus weakness versus those expectation a bit about how your end market within industrial are concentrated or not of so great different sector make up our industrial market Ill go through some of those because some investor if they focus on industrials we mean something different than it includes thing factory automation and control medical and healthcare building automation smart grid and energy test and measurement motor drive display space avionics appliance power delivery system pointofsale lighting industrial transportation then a bucket of other small stuff last a you industrial of our revenue largest of there you can see it get very very diverse very quickly even of each of those sector multiple end equipment make each of those up it very similar to last where we did see about half of the sector up and the other sector down together flat there werent any huge movement in either we would call out to it unusual what it looked Do you have a followon do you Around your OpEx it seems you came in fairly light in the versus expectation and where do you see OpEx next on OpEx if you compare it to a yearagoquarter when we had continued cost management on across the and we also had the benefit on a yearago comparison to the action we previously announced in Embedded Processing and Japan those are now done we get benefit over it relates to sequential even a you coming into the a bit better than expected cost management continuing also in there were a few item didnt recur in and and so gave u a good benefit to of you well go to our next please next come from with line is now open afternoon for taking my Embedded up over for the no Embedded down over for the versus the prior quarter inflected higher in you MCU and connectivity drove the growth but what end market helped to return this back to yearoveryear growth also what drove the point improvement in operating margin of guess two question there Ill take the one a you Embedded Processing driven by microcontrollers and connectivity and both of those business tend to be very broad market exposure a high exposure to industrial also have some exposure of processor to automotive what drove the weakness in and the reason why processor declined over the exposure to wireless infrastructure is the simplest way to operating margin the short answer is we had announced at the end of some restructuring action Embedded Processing would wind up last and in fact they have a lot of cost is out and so a a result their operating margin are coming through very nicely yeah Nice job on of well you squeeze in a but well make an exception for you on this one appreciate Last you indicated you were bringing down utilization in the to try and reduce inventory Looks you executed to Should we anticipate margin in down in line with the lower utilization in not to try to forecast individual line of the PL but Ill bring you back to what had mentioned when asked his expect utilization to decline pardon me utilization to be about excuse me start to be about even in versus so we expect start to actually change start were already down versus and versus a yearago and well maintain those start about even into of right you and the other certainly the other consideration with is what happens to revenue overall well have le revenue so thatll impact margin you well go to the next please next come from with line is now open if we at some sort of normal or reasonable projection for for your revenue be flat but your margin be up and your OpEx be down If we assume the sort of bleah environment continues into and revenue is sort of whatever around the flattish or something is there any way margin could go up and OpEx go down again you of take u through the put and pull for next on those Ill go ahead and take you through on those sort of thing off hoping wrong in your theory about revenue being flat again next Me too want to keep my job under scenario doubt wed see a whole lot of change in operating expenditure other than normal annual pay and benefit increase on the margin side on the margin side wed continue to see benefit a we see more and more of our production moving to millimeter which a you recall give u about a chip cost production from an overall cost of good standpoint so certainly benefit our margin line addition to we continue to see an expansion of revenue coming out of the industrial and automotive space a a percent of the total and those tend to through at higher margin a well a overall catalog product versus custom product our mix then the last item is a we talked about for a year now our CapEx been running under our depreciation by a of point and is slowly beginning to close fact you can even see gap closing in this comparison a we out into youll see gap close a bit more those in combination give u continued tailwind on the margin line Should fall all the way through to the operating margin of and add too even with this if the revenue projection in a you our cash flow margin continued to expand and what were focused on Do you have a followup if we at what revenue did in and what projecting for in it even with last and it sound even though is still of bleah it getting a bit better Would you characterize the environment overall a of normal if it not normal then where would be your biggest area of concern or weakness of if you at the midpoint of our guidance it would suggest our revenue would be down from the yearago similar to the number we turned in a well a what we saw in we described the environment hasnt changed very much believe were operating in a weak macro environment we continue to focus on and the is showing the result of focus and the strength of the model in general what we believe were operating in well go to the next please next come from with line is now open for taking my wonder if you had a customer in the or if you had any meaningful change in revenue from a single customer would have affected the overall trend in the during the of Will when we had if we at last we had our largest customer of revenue we give customer size by but we expect customer a theyve done well this they could in around of our revenue this we at customer we sell them hundred of device across multiple product if contrasted to the last we had a customer more than most of revenue concentrated in a few part and a single application even more specifically than it one function maybe different generation we had one function at customer even of this customer quite a bit of diversity Do you have a followon Will it sort of related to this exited the wireless apps processor and baseband a few year suppose the answer is around the concentration at the part number but what look a growing exposure to the handset market through at least one but multiple customer concern the the way in a similar way caused you to exit some product previously Will when you heard Daves opening remark we saw growth in personal electronics and without one customer growing personal electronics wouldve been down also telling u a handset overall grow theyre becoming the larger piece of the personal electronics space so whats important is to have a lot of different chip selling into a lot of different customer who sell into space and exactly what we have so from standpoint if were to participate in personal electronics to be a participating in handset and there are a lot of very attractive chip opportunity handset unlike what we had a number of year a you remembered with baseband and processor where those part were basically standardizing and commoditizing and your ability to differentiate diminished and therefore your ability to attract profit from selling those part diminished so consequently see this a quite a bit different given the diversity of product were talking about here than the example of when we were baseband and processor fiveplus year of and add to if you across personal electronics and you add smartphones and tablet and PCs and TVs and thing if you added all those together scaring unit even though unit pool isnt to grow much there a there opportunity to find product live through multiple generation you can sell to multiple customer and place where well continue to try to steer our investment overall you Will and well go to the next please next come from with line is now open Capital afternoon for taking my two related question a clarification the upside in the came from wireless infrastructure and industrial seems HVAL up a lot Was part of what calling industrial then maybe bigger picture from a geographic perspective there obviously been some negative data point in of the industrial market any change over the summer it China now seeing some issue any perspective from a geographic of me answer your which if you at HVAL HVAL have a high exposure to automotive which help drive those revenue Itll also have exposure to personal electronics a well have some industrial exposure but those are the area drive revenue you had a followup Capital what seeing from a geographic perspective China weak yeah of so yeah if at our regional result over revenue down in Asia in Europe and Japan it up If you at the broader China market it wasnt down differently than what the broader Asia and of down consistent with our overall revenue didnt see much different Ill add is a lot of time were asked by investor what our exposure to China is or to a particular market and in our we give a very precise number of what we ship into China being we always to point out if looking for what exposure to a particular market is most investor are asking how much of our product is actually consumed there so it a very different number than much lower than because obviously some of those product we ship there end up getting shipped into other region Ill also point out we may ship product into a Tier OEM get put into a European automobile in Europe and then shipped into China you cant at any of our regional result and understand but overall a good proxy to begin to start an analysis would be to at what China is a a percentage of GDP and of start an analysis from there you and well go to the next please next come from with line is now open you wonder if you could a bit about your customer inventory gave u the very helpful disti resale and inventory number but in general you had a good in a weaker this but my perception is the customer inventory management lead day held hasnt changed you about whether any inflection there in the last few quarter of of course the distribution inventory a you we can see very well of our revenue are on consignment for those portion which include of our distributor revenue but we for portion of our revenue there is no inventory so it actually zero obviously in good shape if you overall the classic of bookedshipped carrying inventory type portion of our revenue is about of our revenue where well carry backlog customer have inventory we see any sign customer inventory are significantly out of whack you can always find pocket here and there we believe theyre fairly lean with very few exception such a the wireless infrastructure do you have any followons and did want to follow up on wireless infrastructure it up recovering from a lower Do you have visibility into whether sort of China deployment or Western deployment what do you see a the trajectory for of so we have our exposure in wireless infrastructure if you at the major OEMs make up the majority of market well have a different product exposure but a fairly consistent exposure across them if there demand in any of the region well typically participate in If you at by technology oftentimes another cut people at a strong position in a slightly stronger position in even in newer area we expect growth in the future been investing in a an example small cell been investing and believe well have a very strong position there a well our number arent so much impacted by a region Of course we wont escape it either if there weakness in any particular region you well go to the next please next come from with line is now open Congrats on the strong result in the you gave the yearoveryears you mentioned the wireless infrastructure up hoping you could give the sequential direction by the other market and from the math you gave earlier for last by the end market it seemed to imply the combination of industrial and your comm infrastructure your wireless infrastructure must have been up the better part of if you could comment on the directional color by and if those magnitude are anywhere close would be helpful of so can share with you some color automotive market grew led by our ADAS and infotainment sector Industrial again about even personal electronics up with growth in most of the sector make up market Communications equipment up a we talked about earlier due to wireless infrastructure enterprise system about even and a we talked about most of those area were stronger than we had expected but specifically wireless infrastructure and industrial on the yearoveryear growth though not on the number you were reciting there but industrial overall over only up about then wireless sorry talking because wireless infrastructure is still down over Sequential industrial actually down about overall then wireless infrastructure again up in single digit not much growth there of do you have a followup a quick one more housekeeping not to give exact guidance on the margin you earlier but a far a OpEx directionally in the and you tend to have some yearend phenomenon impact any sort of color on those two quarter would be helpful it to be normal to what in quarter memory is quite correct on is typically down low to midsingle digit percentagewise because of seasonality of holiday around Thanksgiving and Christmas then is typically up in a reverse direction Again because of the absence of holiday and also because of the implementation of our annual pay and benefit increase if you at the of year to to the best proxy for you to try to model into your spreadsheet for now of you we can go to the next please next come from with line is now open Erik Rasmussen is Erik calling in for lot of question have been asked but back to the millimeter strategy can you give u an update on exiting the maybe how much of would you expect to be coming out of the fabs to support of Erik Ill well give an update to in our capital management call can part of our plan to qualify our factory so qualification is planned to be done before the end of the so were still tracking to been releasing product to RFAB or the Richardson fab for some so were to continue to do we still have quite a bit of capacity to be able to grow into do you have a followon Erik Rasmussen no you helpful Embedded Processing obviously the operating margin looked very good this Going and you want to give too much guidance on this but what are the expectation for this Will it be lumpy in term of the improvement Was this a bit more of an outsized in term of the improvement or should we see what are some of the expectation for group Erik Ill tell you team been working hard for a number of year now to grow their revenue talked about their mission over the last of year been cost containment and growing the revenue and they are achieving very good result on now Importantly theyre a strong contributor to our cash flow growth a our cash flow at the tends to be weaker in the quarter and stronger in the of quarter it any different than when we take a at how some of the unit underneath perform on metric being a theyre the one contributing to cash flow tend to at these thing over a longer of time because to can be noisy team done a very good job of getting it margin up to where we it entitlement is at and they should be performing at for the foreseeable future in fact the long is what we expect out of them of Ill add a mentioned the growth been coming through from the investment made highlighted they a well a had achieved record level of revenue a a result of those investment Together and Embedded have grown for nine quarter in a row over and there one where Embedded actually did well but didnt grow over and last had the big headwind from wireless infrastructure the other part of obviously did very well we have for one last well take our last from with line is now open very much a detail of your earlier answer noted personal electronics up because of demand from one customer What about your broader segment Would you still have yearoveryear growth in both and Embedded if it hadnt been for same one customer of actually have data broken out between the two segment but personal electronics is mostly of so our personal electronics without customer obviously wasnt up would have impacted me you the other side of too in we had a significant change in foreign exchange rate at the beginning of the so actually in the and again in the we saw and expected about a negative top line impact due to foreign exchange rate we can always pick out individual piece beauty of the model is we have ten of thousand of customer buying ten of thousand of part into almost every electrical and electronic market out there and the diversity is what is paying off for shareholder in cash flow generation of good very much of guess you have followup actually one quick one you move more to millimeter are you vacating any millimeter facility you might be able to close down or sell eventually of put in place millimeter capacity in the Richardson fab and put together the plan of the millimeter factory to be able to support growth why there releasing new product into those factory what theyre there for and thatll help u maximize cash flow of well you and you all for joining u expecting Marty McFly to actually get in the queue but he didnt a of this call is and you can find it on our new and improved today teleconference may now you and have a great',\n",
       "       'a bit about the announcement you made believe there a meeting and some of the cash return metric updated not the target but what actually approved to do about the dividend and the buyback of all for having u appreciate it recently announced both increased our divided a well a authorized an additional for share repurchase had a consistent increased dividend a u do over the year on the buyback standpoint the is a figure done in the done between one other we did done a well and is reloading on the authorization no change in our commitment to return of our cash flow to investor u do through dividend a well a the steady repurchase of share Ill maybe point out our share count been reduced through those repurchase since the beginning of by if you put this together it to get you over what about dividend yield at the current rate about right Somewhere in do you judge the balance between those two between the dividend and the share repurchase do great on both of them obviously but how do you prioritize one versus the other how we about is we take the previous four year cash flow we take half of number and use a the target for the dividend increase What translated to is about to of our cash flow to dividend and about if in an environment where continuously increasing cash flow youll be a bit ahead of mark we offer flexibility for u to have a dividend increase if we entered into a of prolonged economic weakness we could still have the judgment ability to still increase the dividend even in environment Is the increase inaudible so havent been able to check it versus prior increase how the chosen chosen with framework yeah Going you can see if you run the number it not an absolute number it a starting point for u to have gauge but it real close to road to get u there whats the again the capital allocation not only cash return to shareholder but also the balance sheet and the amount of leverage you want to be able to have on the balance sheet in the talked about the importance of having a pristine credit rating Talk a bit about how much leverage like to have on the balance sheet when we acquired National we did primarily we did some cash on deal but we had we started with about of debt if my memory serf me correctly been slowly paying down over and obviously our ability to borrow increased so some amount of spread between those two number when we acquired National our belief we were to pay debt back of on the schedule a we had set up the debt a low interest rate had persisted we came to the conclusion and comfortable with debt being on the balance sheet permanently a long a it make economic what u do this a an example we have paid off well end up paying off about of debt and then rolling the balance of the debt inaudible ph basically how were thinking about it it a moving target depending upon the health of other aspect of the but what sort of debt load do you you could carry and still have the highest credit rating which believe correct me if wrong is a priority to maintain a priority to maintain it If we had something significant happen where we felt we needed to take up more debt we would do do it very very thoughtfully and very carefully all thing being equal we have plan or want to change part of the reason why you see u slowly working down debt over Again were comfortable having it but you we to open up capacity over give u more strategic option at some point in the future To the extent it possible or possible to answer willing to answer roughly is what you have in believe debt right now Three yeah a under four Right What amount do you you could you triple size double size would still keep you in the target Not a number wed want to give out but again had on the balance sheet at one point so Right a number higher than Right why we stick with the whole cash allocation side of the equation Whats your opinion on the MA on in the space hasnt well guess it depends somewhat how you define the market but it hasnt hit the big four player yet were the last one to do a big deal with National Semi Talk a bit about approach to MA and the potential involvement our approach hasnt changed you we basically have two lens we would at any potential acquisition with the is a strategic one there we would for an and wed want to find a a very diverse set of customer diverse set of product and product are finding longlived position in the marketplace product are differentiated aka they have good margin and having a continuing to put out those highquality product you want to buy something you good ten year and still not producing goodquality part if you of National theyre a great test key for right can go through the check list there and check off each of those a you walk through you some of the thing we for from a strategic standpoint If you from a financial standpoint well at a lot of different financial metric a of them would to the top would be can we achieve our costtocapital in a three to fouryear how investment versus buying back our own share whats the cash flow return off of investment with our stock price didnt do the math but were above cash flow yield a point not too far long were about on target those are some of the thing well at Nothing is ever absolute on each of those metric but those are the thing go into consideration this in the so this is nothing new make to clarify upfront but why prioritize over embedded embedded is another strategic focus area for the but repeatedly even last up here is the priority not embedded Right one versus the other come down to those business theyre both goodquality business a you talked about but they make their money very differently what mean by is is if you have a very unique product and you get customer or customer value uniqueness they could buy product for you five year year year and there economic benefit for uniqueness embedded having a unique architecture or having a bunch of architecture doesnt help you running a good embedded want to have a few of architecture a possible a many customer and a much revenue over those buying other company and sticking together more architecture bigger is not better in case lot of example or several example of company were stuck together have lot of architecture you the number one supplier a an example there lot of architecture they struggle financially so the scalability is much better in the side is what it come down to on the architecture other aspect of the strategic focus would would in when looking at deal if you have a very large fab footprint Yup been opportunistic in adding to the leader with millimeter capacity etcetera Does it go into the equation of somebody who could help fill those fabs Youre not for scale for volume sake along but all else being equal if somebody is using a bunch of millimeter wafer at Y Z foundry would itd be all the better to build them internally the simple answer is no me back up and explain why me start with you put in place over the last few year an millimeter plant so last we built about of product on millimeter the reason why we millimeter it give u a cost advantage when we do we gave an example of how run through the PL and the silicon cost at le it about half of the cost of the total product in example we gave for a product we sold for a dollar and at margin same product built on millimeter give u profit economically there a lot of reason why youd want to do it reason why the answer is no is if you of the type of company wed be interested and one fit criterion they by nature have a very diverse customer base trying to move each of the product over to take too long to involve isnt the reason to do the acquisition some of the reason would assume you havent closed any of the fabs came with came with National correct Same sort of it easier to redesign thing at most than it is to port them over right moved some of the process technology from National into our factory so theyve released new product then our engineer and their engineer their engineer have access to our other technology which theyve used and some of our product group have used some of their older technology a well we get a benefit in both direction since we talked about the millimeter side a bit about the endmarkets most applicable to Some of the clarification on math with the margin is you it cost saving but the dye itself is only half of the cost and so of get you to the benefit talking about sort of costcentric area would would be bestsuited to higher volume endmarkets but so about the endmarkets best fit what doing in millimeter there you if you build anything with lower cost then market go to a lower cost it benefit any of the market serve in fact all four of our unit have product running of Richardson there a belief jeez yeah built so many product in each millimeter lot there only a few product would make to go there in fact we can actually build split lot where well have in a wafer manufacturing lot theoretically we could have different product running there Practically we do but you could you run one wafer and of another type of a manufacturing lot we can do because millimeter manufacturing equipment is fully automated wafer are not touched once they enter the building until they go out the other end Everything is done you through machine handling it and moving it around the fab why you can build type of efficiency see same type of efficiency in a millimeter fab the last on the fab footprint is some of the competitor actually two out of the three largest competitor are doing increasing amount of foundry usage instead of adding their own fabs or even in some case theyre shutting down fabs a bit about what you the tradeoff is where is willing to have it own fab footprint where others are to foundry whats the sort of advantage or tradeoff you see in making those strategic decision you when we at our strategy of acquiring asset at very low price and putting in place capacity were able to put of open millimeter capacity to grow into and were able to grow into it and keep our CapEx at of sale give u control of our manufacturing process allows u to continue to invest and differentiate and process technology If moving to a fab and let you develop a process technology and to run more wafer a something not attractive from a foundry standpoint but flexibility to be able to do thing maybe linking back even to your last we may have some product you we can shoot down a nanometer on some of the equipment of our fab you may have product run at nanometer when running on equipment you can get tighter tolerance and differentiate your product on some of them by running it there a lot of advantage to doing it and again those asset are to be have useful life of a decade or or year in some case the return on investment be very high when locked into a foundry for product across customer you the reason why we wouldnt want to move those product it difficult to move them out of those fabs you and year from now who have more pricing power between the of the fab or the people putting purse on it Those type of thing compel u to want to continue to own our own fabs again if any investor have any or anybody in the audience have any question raise your hand well get the mic over to you we shift over a to the endmarket side of thing break out thing most precisely between embedded and other if we went into the endmarket way of looking at it a bit about the growth driver within the industrial and automotive market Those are the two you highlighted a growing fast a being focal point for the starting in the industrial side what are some of the driver you see how much of is to be GDPdependent you can do everything you want to do but inaudible up here and yeah still to be if GDP is bad it to be hard to grow Right you in industrial we it obvious if you looked around and see where semiconductor are showing up werent there a few year and reminded on my trip here DallasFort Worth Airport they redid a parking structure and this before where you pull in and itll tell you you by floor how many parking spot theyve pull up to a road and you can down and there a light above it either green if it or red if it not all of information get aggregated together if there of content per parking spot or per spot but five year it zero the general theme is thing are getting smarter and more connected driving growth another example have Ive told you my daughter a new nurse and she work at Childrens Hospital if ever been in a hospital and Pulse Ox go on your finger and of pinch a bit and a uncomfortable now imagine on a sixmonth old child they a lot right some new technology coming out wireless a patch they can put on the child and itll wirelessly communicate there more content in patch than there is on a mechanic snap on your finger it hard to it one the beauty of market not one not one type of application where you can up with a new architecture not one connectivity standard not one sensor go into were positioned well to service those type of market on the automotive side you there all the buzz word of ADAS and fully automated driving etcetera Walk in a showroom you get excited right amazing the amount of content in last automotive of our revenue should industrials other comment make back to industrial a over a dozen sector make up industrial and the largest of which is about of our revenue you can tell it very very broadbased from standpoint Inside of automotive five sector make up the market for u largest is infotainment and cluster display next is ADAS or Advanced Driver Assist Systems then powertrain which includes electric vehicle and hybrid After is safety then something we called Body of signal light incabin lighting touchsensitive button to put the window up and down and those type of thing when we at growth over automotive for u grew double digit Those five sector all of them grew double digit with the exception of one one grew rounded down to nine very broadbased growth and we every semiconductor is seeing opportunity there but and were translating it into revenue Everybody is seeing the growth a you and it all content is the answer Right investor simultaneously get concerned about it if you fewer highend car are being sold into China whats to happen to the semiconductor are serving the automotive market do you balance the unit side versus the content side spend a lot of worried about it Quite frankly we believe we five and ten year from now there to be more semiconductor and automotive Does mean line is to be straight and up to right every it wont be if go to a market worse choppiness ph comms infrastructure down but it to carrier CapEx it hasnt been down a dramatically a what revenue there Itll back why we worry about those type of thing in the near and longer at it Since you mentioned the comm infrastructure side people what percentage of sale roughly or maybe what it a and what it is now unfortunately the number is much smaller comms equipment is of our revenue area getting all the attention is wireless infrastructure of our revenue wireless infrastructure is whats down out of the point Ten of the yeah Ten percent of revenue Correct is comms infrastructure down a good ship both and embedded and custom ASIC into make good money and carrier CapEx been down from a demand return havent tried to be public on when we itll return Most of revenue tends to be on consignment so very good visibility even with visibility it can change quickly you we do it return and well be for it when it Knowing full well it only of your and maybe if you can round up inaudible line of sight ph Ill ask the anyway the wireless side so we feel excited about base station LTE rollouts etcetera etcetera seems we never good enough time to warrant the down over and it not to company it almost every is saying the same without the party we have such a hangover market always been choppy right Ill go back to to of we saw our revenue fall we part of the reason is is operator announced theyre getting tender theyre to spend x billion of dollar they typically give their OEMs or our customer a very short of to deliver product theyve to get to be able to ship product when their customer want it and the dynamic drive those cycle more than anything else you it you at our revenue overall this well ship and last balanced a good position across all the major OEMs continue to invest in area small cell ph a an example it a good market continue to make lot of money in it be ready to support higher revenue when our customer need it it is what it is you cant control part of it Is there any aspect of the strategic choice made in becoming more of an analogy le digital so would assume some of the custom ASICs might not be a higher priority a they once were and feel to correct me if wrong on in the standalone DSPs a well when you move more and le digital if those two are deprioritized to any extent do you thered be any TIspecific headwind or you still would have a popup everybody is down youll get better than but it might not bounce back a much because of logical strategic choice made even had some people take the opposite side of and hey you called it right in cutting your OpEx in this area Neither of those were the case right both ph have to do depending on how you want to at you same thing through a different corner of the box Lots of way to be wrong right belief is carrier CapEx slowly decline when you over the next and year it not to go to zero believe there the same growth in carrier CapEx a what over the last year doesnt make it a bad market mean you invest differently when the market exists lot of this equipment have life of year you about operator are putting equipment out into the marketplace there coexistence issue and compatibility issue fallback they need to worry about this isnt a cell phone cycle being replaced every nine month They have very very long lifecycles to them were investing at a rate we is appropriate Still it isnt zero we plan to be in market an important market for u again we talked a bit about spending money on small cell get some revenue this in small cell but been investing at least for five year in it with we started those investment year if you started about five year about year too late so again long great market long cycle market continue to invest in it well work hard to earn with our customer there are two topic you mentioned almost in passing but are important one to hit upon the consignment side you mentioned it give good visibility Talk a bit about the adoption of what percentage of the is exposed to it then on one hand can see how visibility is better because there no buffer in between where worried about how much inventory is floating around because you control and you recognize the revenue until theyre pulled Right flipside of it in the it a backendloaded if they all the inventory is there waiting for them it could make thing even more backendweighted because they have the luxury of doing handtomouth while on one hand it more visibility on the other hand the order arent to until the last minute about the strategic choice and how much of your actually impact or is delivered way about of our revenue go through distribution of go through a consignment program if you at our result last we ended the with week of inventory at our distributor the lowest number in my career at which is more than year now but it low primarily because of the structural reason of were paring ph inventory on our book you can see in our inventory number it also low because been delivering consistently on and had lead time have been consistent pushing three year now for the reason you customer comfortable they can get product they have to have a big buffer themselves contributing to putting pressure on having le inventory out there good because it give u better visibility to actually where demand is at our distributor in particular we can hold inventory and because we control it we can get it we can get it to the distributor may need it or an OEM need it and you end up with these large pocket of inventory end up out there when you have direct control overall it a good way to boil down demand to being true demand because they have no reason to you doublebooking and all those sort of issue carrying thought ph of having the inventory would theoretically be the downside carrying day instead of you used to do whatever or or something Correct yes Right Got you number is two thigs is is the consignment which is an obvious one of were carrying on our book versus them but also we structured how restructured how we manage our own inventory to ensure more stable lead time and ensure higher service level delivering product when we we part of is is during peak period of weaker demand well build smaller volume product a an example of you have a product run unit a it may take a half an hour to set up or tear down a piece of assembly test equipment so and it may take you an hour to run those part you it run for four hour and now you three year of demand go into finished good you confidence to sell product over the next five and ten year why not do out of the way then so when you have higher volume higher demand coming through the factory not setting up and tearing down a lot doing able to use your asset more effectively there a lot of different thing are into why the number were it is a we talked about earlier you were actually a lot of these thing are new so were using this to of study whats on we talked about the fact in on our capital management call it one of the thing we would wed update Right we and again if you have any question in the audience raise your hand Lets switch over to the margin side of thing Walk u through the margin potential of the risen very impressively over the last of year Talk about how much is utilization driven versus depreciation falling off albeit with a depreciation falling not being a cash benefit to you but definitely helping the margin side back in we tried to articulate why we believed we could increase our cash flow margin back into the margin because the number given to operate the sustainably at we put the caveat around it to be in good market and were saying hey if the world not falling apart or something weird is on we can operate there consistently turned in cash flow margin this so point of improvement a big part of be the fact we build more product on millimeter a we fill up of capacity and we enjoy lower silicon cost other piece a you to contribute to is the fixed cost right of capacity running through the PL you you put more product on it fall through nicely a well get a benefit a we secularly industrial automotive grow faster than other market and those product tend to have higher margin on them too then the last mechanically of course the depreciation and CapEx number converge and down to around the we plan to spend on CapEx lot of moving part on not only the margin but also the cash flow side of it right the last on my side and the last of minute we have is on the OpEx side of thing one of the biggest change at least versus my model in the last of year is your RD from of sale now down to maybe or or Talk a bit about the strategic rationale behind getting it low when Ive asked in the at different time how sustainable it is the answer from yourself whomever it may be the is well were not actually spending on our core area were spending the same amount a our competitor or an appropriate amount Now it seems the answer is more of the to why you ask them why theyre spending so much a bit about how you it down to because at approximation one of the biggest margin improvement to the cash flow line out of anything done you may remember it a we actually showed a slide in our capital management where we went back and showed our spend of RD a a percentage of revenue and you can see line whittled around a bit it set back to you eight year or so of data where it hasnt changed Excuse me inaudible sorry What changed is we exited wireless and pulled OpEx off in the embedded side we of course actually increased the amount of money were spending and impacted the operating margin there spend been effective it translated into share gain talked a bit about this before we sat down averaged around to point a share gain both in a well a in EP it isnt about trying to spend more money it spending money effectively and having result from it what were trying to do at the end of the day you have no reason to believe it anything other than sustainable amount correct yeah you and were running short of if put into of how we about our overall four competitive advantage were continuing on investing so and those are thing covered here of manufacturing and technology give u a cost advantage the breadth of the product portfolio the reach of our sale channel and then our longlived diverse position when we about it is can we strengthen those four competitive advantage and building a broad portfolio if theyre not good product doesnt matter if you do twice a many of them you it finding the product customer want have a differentiated position and what were focused on you very much for coming',\n",
       "       'can take our from with go ahead guess a bit of a longerterm you give u your having the benefit of six seven month of hindsight on why the semi market is of sucking wind right now then the last thing were this and so if you could give u a of comparison on how thing are right now versus and Is it better Is it worse Is it the same Do we not Ill go ahead and take a stab at guess what were seeing right now is basically customer adjusting their expectation a to the growth rate for the remainder of the toning down a bit on where theyre at actually believe what were seeing is more a symptom of a macrobased of event market getting a bit more cautious especially with all the news flow in the financial market thing you hear out of Europe thing you hear out of China the fact is the sign were seeing suggest to u were in a traditional of market macro driven not necessarily a semi cycle per se continue to see lead time are quite short cancellation remain low distributor inventory at historically low level a mentioned all thing put together what were seeing is a growth rate on a macro slower in the half than what people thought coming into the half to comparison to there were too many thing on back then had earthquake event in Japan can recall had flooding in Thailand these are comparable event we can about on front Do you have a followon guess to dig in a more can you give u a color on linearity then in term of the end market you talked about softness in communication and the new softness in industrial go down your end market a far a which is stable which is getting better which is getting worse Ill make a comment on both revenue and order linearity in the both case revenue and order increased each during the a you at the end market detail a had walked through in general we saw automotive strong with all the sector of growing or all but one growing at doubledigit rate Industrial revenue flat contrasting to last quarter yearoveryear growth we didnt see growth there it incrementally weaker than we had expected a we had talked about of there we saw about half of the sector increase and of course offset by decline in the other sector Personal electronics a we talked about grew in total due to specifically one large customer outside of customer actually saw almost every decline including PCs a we were expecting Comms infrastructure a we mentioned impacted by or comms equipment impacted by wireless infrastructure and down from a and actually weaker than what we had expected when we started the then the last enterprise system declined due to DLP projector a we had expected of a summary of what we saw by end market and well move to the next and from with go ahead you afternoon for taking my the result you talked about incrementally weaker trend in Industrial been a particular focus by the market you about the geographical trend within your industrial Theres a lot of concern around demand trend in industrial in Europe and China Love to get some color from you so me tell you what happened with the revenue in the yearoveryear revenue down a we mentioned before Europe down the most and Japan also down Asia flat while the up a sequential standpoint revenue up led by the Asia and Europe were both about even while Japan down were always cautious give you information and walk through it but were always cautious because reflective of where we ship product versus where it actually consumed and it hard for u to see regional weakness unless it extremely pronounced in a market industrial because of the ten of thousand of customer make up market do you have a followon last you the team they were to bring down utilization Did you in fact bring them down directionally where do you expect them to head into the dollar inventory stayed relatively flat Does the team expect this to down in given the weaker demand profile the in fact we did reduce utilization in the factory in the inventory actually came in right about where we expected day given the outlook we have described to you we do intend to further reduce factory utilization in the and we expect the result of is our inventory down somewhat in the a a result of the reduction were planned for a well a the take a while for to flow through the system you next please well go next to with go ahead afternoon so much for taking the is on consolidation you have been very clear in your articulation of what you for and what the parameter are over have a question about consolidation in the current environment Does the current environment where revenue for the industry are in some sharp decline change the view on nearterm consolidation potential in the you worry about paying a multiple for a cash flow stream to wind up being much lower over the next month than what it currently is create more of an incremental opportunity love your perspective on the timing doesnt enter into our thinking with some of the point you brought up although they make for interesting discussion they actually alter the way we tend to about MA discussed in the the and most important is any potential MA consideration to be consistent with our strategy in our mind be something to be focused on helping drive our success in the space then beyond a you were alluding to in your comment there we have been and expect to continue to be quite disciplined on making we can get a return on what spent at some of the price you might see of certain company out there and you factor in a premium looking at what Ive in some other company getting a return return doesnt seem a good longterm strategy for maximizing shareholder value so our inclination is to make return can see their way our cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe and well stay disciplined on front very helpful you for the followup how do you about what the company longterm growth rate is in this environment mean it good last in a tougher environment now of down on a yearoveryear for revenue this and maybe flattish for the if we at normal seasonality for the back half might be overly negative to of take this snapshot in for longterm growth last overly positive Do you something of in between what youll achieve this and what you achieved last is a reasonable view on what longterm normalized revenue growth could be thinking about it right is you should at it over period of and not start from the wrong a high we take a and we make the assumption the semiconductor market continue to grow at call it the global GDP and on increased content into industrial and automotive continue to drive demand then a of what do you the GDPs to do over the long the global GDP clearly it appear and certainly in the last three four year and the next few year it been slower than what we saw in the prior decade or decade before the overall industry is again in our view grow at about the global GDP and the global GDP is the real wildcard here is trying to figure out how fast thatll grow were preparing ourselves for the fact it doesnt see any real robust growth to help u and therefore we have to focus on and making ourselves stronger internally add to our model is robust Even in a weak environment this it throw off lot of cash the capacity to support much stronger rate of growth if were to show up itll be a lot more fun if we get into an environment where GDP growth is stronger and everyone can argue what the multiplier on semiconductor growth rate overall are we can still operate and produce lot of cash even in these weaker market well to having more fun when it stronger and Sounds good you Go to our next please the next come from with go ahead USA afternoon for me ask a guess the is you took some utilization action in the but margin were actually up and very healthy Is the right way to about this is the utilization action impact impact specifically can you help me about how should be thinking about the margin in the around some of the utilization action taking so a thing on there a we see more of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive an attractive profit mix so you saw some of in the heard Daves remark talking about strength in automotive we saw in the clearly having a benefit to our margin even in the light of lightening up on our utilization a bit are correct in utilization change have an immediate impact They tend to it take a few month for it to roll through the system so some of in More of it be in also have lower overall manufacturing cost a were beginning to see depreciation starting to slowly trickle off were becoming much more efficient in our factory were getting more and more of our revenue off of much lowercost millimeter a number of thing combined are keeping those margin in a healthy state we into next wouldnt expect a significant any of material change in particular metric in USA helpful then a my followup you are constantly of pruning the portfolio of the thing been talked about is whether or not to plan to do sort of power on the new Skylake platform of a to how the and your desire to want to participate there is impacting either the result or more importantly the guide in Is there sort of a hit coming because not to participate there Again if there is can you help u quantify the size of the and of where it go over what seeing in our result nothing to do with the investment on a Vcore product line Ill we continually at our investment and we want to obviously invest in place where we lead to sustainable revenue a differentiated position and solid return there portion within Vcore are more attractive and le commoditized than others were continuing to make those investment we there have been rumor out there were exiting the space in total and not true again these are fairly small tweak to where we direct our RD resource those team are off investing in other area and producing product we believe give u longerterm better result Ill contrast to a market where we may have exited wireless where were actually reducing and exiting a market were not doing here hope help can go to our next please the next come from with go ahead product mix your space you obviously have done a great job over a to an explanation why the HVAL side is growing so much faster over over the last quarter versus HPA specifically recall asking question about HPA investment in the and seemed to be an area of extreme focus given it high profitability the growth doesnt seem to be keeping up with HVAL any color on be helpful when you at both SVA a well a HPA those business have different exposure to various end market actually both of those business have a higher exposure to both industrial a well a communication equipment Youll see a HVAL have a higher exposure to personal electronics automotive automotive good point what seeing in those result Do you have a followup Switching gear quickly but of a followon to Johns earlier any sort of color you can provide on the OpEx side helpful to have margin relatively flattish but how do you adjust the OpEx given the revenue have been a challenged looking already taken action on the OpEx side had announced a and a half now action we were taking in Embedded Processing and Japan and those are much complete now Youre seeing those benefit OpEx in the result we turned in the last quarter These shortterm fluctuation in revenue we those lead u to rash decision could have a negative impact on u make longerterm decision based upon strategy we into if you at the last of year to OpEx been flat to roughly down expect anything different than recent history a we go into of this you we can go to our next please our next come from with of of you for taking my the you mentioned this decline in wireless infrastructure If you could help u quantify what proportion of your sale is now versus last the about is and it not a we are seeing from Xilinx and others there is no slowdown in mobile data consumption there is no slowdown in LTE user so why are you seeing such a large decline in wireless infrastructure buildouts Is it an excess inventory of base station Is it a move away from your product Is it a share issue If you could help me understand would be very helpful yeah our communication equipment market is at the end of last about the largest of wireless infrastructure at about given you the color on half the size havent gone through all the end equipment percentage but thatll get you into the ZIP code of the impact to our it interesting you bring it up continues to actually be a very good market for u one were continuing to make investment had dialed back some of the investment a or so of Embedded Processing and a view market over carrier CapEx isnt to go up it decline slightly a we over the next five and year and perhaps longer carrier CapEx isnt to zero revenue return been notoriously a choppy market it the dynamic of the market the way the tender go out the way the OEMs have to prepare to deliver product Oftentimes it in a or day window so this isnt new to u used to it can still make a lot of money and generate a lot of cash from this market so well continue to do it is choppy a characteristic a you to other semiconductor supplier supply into market consistent with what all of u see do you have a followup of on my followup wondering if is still right incremental margin number to of because you are guiding sale at the midpoint to go up somewhat but saying margin be flattish a part of this slowdown in sale have any impact on how soon you move your capacity over to millimeter you the fallthrough is still a good one to use but keep in mind it noisy from to something you should over a multiquarter a you move through youll get good product margin fallthrough a we go into next but a mentioned were also dialing back some of the factory start so you have moving part there when you over a longer of than a when you start seeing to migrating product to you millimeter He meant millimeter to we have on the radar Hes thinking well ahead yeah millimeter we continue to do what we have been doing in the and is many of our new product are released are being released on millimeter and becomes even more valuable to the a we move Keep in mind what we talked back in the capital call is in addition to our Richardson fab which is capable of about of total millimeter revenue we have also begun the conversion of our factory which provide an additional of revenue capability with of conversion under way clearly new product were releasing are being biased towards millimeter versus Active product on for the most part continue where theyre at Ill add to a we had indicated before the qualification a of version is under way and we expect the qualification to be completed by the end of the still on track for you and we can go to the next please the next come from with you wanted to dig into the industrial market a more deeply had talked about being a bit weaker than expected in the then recognize into one of the seasonally weaker quarter for industrial you heard the commentary from one of your competitor earlier you help u to get some perspective on what your customer are telling you in market you to give commentary on whats baked into your guidance but to of help ground u in how thinking about particular market at this point not a lot to add did it again use the word incrementally weaker gave you the color we saw growth in half the sector and offset even of there a bit of choppiness a we obviously a we get the demand signal both in order a well a from what we can see from consignment through our distributor there signal we at there a mentioned earlier people are taking a more cautious outlook into besides have too much to add if you the only you of is industrial of our revenue in my recollection is no single in market bigger than were talking about a lot of small customer there not one customer can give u a signal whats on seems to be a broadbased reconsideration on the part of participant in space a to their outlook for growth for the half point do you have a followon a following onto perhaps you could about what you customer are doing with inventory now you had talked about your distributor taking some inventory out of the channel again a they likely reconsider whats on in the half Do you expect the end customer are doing similar on top of what do you expect the distributor do with inventory a they go Do you the inventory level can get leaner than where they are right now in general we believe customer inventory are lean we worked our way through the report and some of the anecdotal from last quarter report a well a the anecdotal information we get from our sale team of course there always the exception within wireless infrastructure a market go through it adjustment with inventory in our distributor at week is a historically low in my tenure a well a Kevins and we reflective of confidence from distributor they believe they can get the product they need from u it driven overall because of the consignment program allow them operationally to run at those level there is a belief confidence in stable lead time and availability of product is working it way out into the customer base a well harder for u to actually have direct visibility talked about were talking customer so it hard to have collectively and go to the next please well go to with Partners go ahead Partners you you talked about order increasing every in the Do you have any order commentary to date assuming were entering with a relatively strong backlog much more conservative are turn order assumption to meet guidance a we did mention earlier on order increased each in the and a to order for this theyre consistent with the guidance we gave early in the call did have a booktobill in of so we did build a bit of backlog but wouldnt call it a dramatic amount consistent though with the outlook we have offered for Ill you you of our revenue go through distribution of is supported by consignment and about of revenue overall is by consignment be careful with the booktobill and part of the reason why we highlight it is because it applies to a smaller portion of our actual revenue and backlog isnt necessarily reflective completely of the demand we actually see do you have a followon Partners done a good job of highlighting your competitive advantage broad portfolio growing into your manufacturing asset mean whats the response though to scenario where there could be some demand in end market on a permanent secular decline mean if you at comms infrastructure PCs some of the consumer market mean how do you address the potential for some permanent decline in some of these end market there been in this for quite a long there always some market in decline and other market are actually in a growth phase the example you offered if in fact they turn out to be in a secular decline the offsetting market for the most obvious one is automotive where were seeing significant content growth not u but many in the industry seeing significant content growth were still in the very early stage of content penetrating automobile a secular growth market would suggest would add for a decade or more a great opportunity for the industry in general and for u in particular because been focused on there for a number of year now then there the broader industrial market where were seeing an increasing usage of semiconductor and equipment in those market simply were never used before a people are using semiconductor in those space theyre finding new application and need for more semiconductor while there may be some market or sector could be in secular decline there are others are in secular growth in general lead u to the belief commented on earlier in the call we the industry overall grow at about the global GDP because these of underlying change on in how semiconductor are being used across our economy and could add too even if you at a market PCs over the next year and year be on a decline we can take two action is well spend differently than we would have spent year and year of market we can still find opportunity where product actually live through one product cycle to the next and still have longlived position even of a market certainly PCs arent away anytime soon there still quite a bit of money can be made in those market you and we can go to the next please we can take the next from with Capital United States you and were trying to understand the difference in the commentary on the order pattern you are seeing versus Linear Same of diversified business in fact they have very similar they have consumer a you do but then you also had infrastructure which is down very hard could you help u understand whats on there then had a very quick followup cannot offer you any insight into Linears order pattern They clearly are the most qualified to do can simply tell you what we saw and is our order increased each of the three month a we came through or two of the three month other word up over and up over a we came through certainly are in different market and could possibly be an explanation but enough about how their order book work to be able to help you with a contrast between the two company Capital United States fair followup is on the factory loading Is the right way to also about when bringing the utilization down mostly on the millimeter and the millimeter continues to creep up actually not a bad way to about it because in fact the way we are operating the millimeter fab our fab is near full equipped utilization other word we have it equipped to full capacity but to the extent we have it equipped we try to keep it quite highly loaded the adjustment we take on loading generally impact the may be some impact in a well but it generally would impact the millimeter factory Ill add any product run any measurable volume often source in multiple factory so it could actually be sourced in a millimeter fab a well a a millimeter fab a you the economics of getting lower cost per chip on a millimeter obviously tilt u into starting millimeter wafer you we can go to the next please our next come from with afternoon you for taking the guess not to beat a dead horse but guess another one on the industrial is what of exposure do you have to the energy patch and your vision for whether troughed andor there further decline ahead a pointed out last of our revenue industrial largest of industrial is factory automation so down well in getting into the very low singledigit percentage by the down onto it very very diverse from standpoint Do you have a followup do guess given your perspective in term of your leverage to personal electronics calculator DLP would love to hear your thought on the global consumer and the health of the consumer and willingness to step up and spend during this macro malaise or pause or whatever you want to call it if you at our personal electronics market it actually up it up because of our exposure in our customer base to the extent there compelling product out there people want drive demand you see stepping up take one customer out of course we saw decline in almost every of personal electronics you of have the good with the bad somewhat of a mix on front might add it not so much consumer willingness to consume those thing more is there something interesting for them to spend their money on certain customer are much more successful at than others you did you have a followup one last please we can go next to with you so much had two guess of all if you at a the whole usually targeting to sort of grow roughly GDP what GDP is be but if you assume a seasonal calendar it implies revenue this is down point it definitely seems to be undergrowing whatever GDP come out to be this this guess my is do you any of this is share Will you end up to have lost any market share this you usually target up about bps per then had a followup so what were talking about again longterm growth rate how the question asked earlier and longterm growth rate we believe be about global GDP you see noise in the quarter to see noise in the year example last the industry arguably grew considerably faster than global GDP it apt to grow le than global GDP to have of noise to deal with it can be mechanically imposed into a formula with precision we out for the reason we talked about increasing penetration in certain market especially auto and industrial continue to require semiconductor content and therell be growth a market share standpoint well be able to answer at the end of the were off to a darn good start so far point out when you at our market share gain theyve averaged to point had year where eked out point and a knockout is point of had a of outcome do you have a followon do the guidance is point below what the fiveyear seasonal is you talked about this and sort of missed it can you sort of try to pinpoint what the primary sort of either geography or end market can potentially explain gap guess thinking about China in particular you sort of help u cover gap we believe there something called a seasonal average in our space you go and take a at any of those quarter the variation is so wide there not anything meaningful in there you at those to growth rate and you see zero to highsingle digit and you can divine too much out of we have to at it in the context of the current global environment Certainly a lot of negative news flow coming out of Europe and some out of China and so on had a slow start to the in the because of weather and the port issue on the West Coast what were seeing is what we talked about early in the call which is on a macro our customer are looking and adjusting their expectation for growth in the half and theyre tweaking down a bit versus what they had anticipated coming into the you very much with you all for joining of this call is on our this today program for your may now Have a great day',\n",
       "       'you we go to with so much for giving me the chance to ask a is so much controversy in the industry about whether the industry is a cyclical a it used to be le so et cetera at your yearoveryear growth rate the represents the you’ve had a yearoveryear decline at the midpoint of your guidance in a long do you about in the context of an industry where many are arguing we’re not cyclical anymore a you we’ve been guarded at trying to predict the cycle it’s not something obviously we can control go to what we can and what we can measure a you of tick through the thing you typically at from a cyclical standpoint we at channel inventory are down a week from a they’re laying at under week Lead are remaining consistent our cancellation and rescheduled are very low addition we’re continuing to deliver on and very consistently with we’ve a of pocket of weaker than expected demand a we talked about specifically in wireless infrastructure and PCs the same we’re seeing automotive and industrial continuing to be a strong a we expect that’s what we that’s what we can see the debate continue on how cyclical our industry be and won’t be might add we do have several significant competitive advantage combination of which we believe is difficult for anybody else to replicate and it help u deal with any notion of cyclicality or noncyclicality those advantage include we’ve the broadest portfolio in the industry mean the engineer start their design work by looking at u enjoy very low cost of manufacturing for all the reason you’ve heard u about for last few year including our millimeter wafer fabs have the broadest sale channel in fact two to four time larger than our nearest competitor we play in an extremely diverse set of market with longlived product enjoy a significant cash return to our shareholder for long we what’s important to deal with whatever happened in market cycle and make we’re a lot more competitively advantage than anybody else you’re talking about some weakness in PCs and coms the industrial we’re starting to see some negative news flow from the customer Do you see pocket of weakness but there is other pocket of strength are offsetting those industrial customer maybe weak because it’s a very broad based customer base do you not see any weakness at all in at this point very much you are hinting to it very broad based so we service over customer most of those reside in industrial again it’s helpful for me to go through and when we industrial it mean something different than the investment definition of industrial it include thing factory automation and control and medical healthcare fitness product building automation smart grid energy test equipment motor drive display space avionics appliance and other segment so again veryvery broad Of course we’ll always see pocket of strength and weakness but overall industrial is doing well we’ve growth in almost all those sector I’ve described we’ll go now to with you did a good job of outlying guess the relative area of weakness in from currency and com and you give u which you would be a bigger drag in term of sale from versus communication then do you expect a negative impact from currency in a well and if you could give u the magnitude of negative impact the one that’s straight to identify because it’s math walking through the number is on yearonyear we’ll see about a headwind due to currency exchange rate and obviously we’re not assuming we see a rebound in those rate still see and expect to see the weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure it’s of in the the balance of the is a you there is always put and take a an example a DLP very strong if you remember it benefiting from several world event one of them the World Cup won’t repeat be weaker than it a and continue for the rest of the of bucket we’ll continue to have put and take other comment I’d make on although we see those pocket of weakness if you at the core business and and embedded we do believe those continue to perform well have a follow up actually the of clarification do we expect the or the wireless infrastructure to have a bigger drag on your revenue in or then it almost seems do we need the dollar to weaken again for impact to go way ie if the dollar remains strong is to be a negative for you every I’d we don’t have enough detail to tell you whether wireless infrastructure or which is to be of a drag we don’t expecting them to be recovering in the it relates to ROE recently with if you take a at the the euro alone versus a it’s down yen is down roughly average about of our revenue in euro and around in yen clearly with weakness on a yearoveryear compare that’s to continue to be an issue that’s to affect of math doesn’t affect our ability to sell in those market continue to make very competitive in those space and we enjoy on the design win unless the ROE move back and dollar weaken than certainly with of dramatic decline in those two major currency be at least on the fringe a yearoveryear compare headwind for u add to we saw in the where we had an impact of about because of natural hedging we’ve the impact to operating profit and cash flow is only about fairly small on front and we’ll move on to the next please now go to with good afternoon for to me ask the guess don’t want to beat a dead horse but on the outlook when at the it look you are only missing the mid point of your guide by about and you explained of on currency go to if of anchor against seasonality you’re of missing it by to and guess are you expecting anymore of headwind from currency understand the yearoveryear compare trying to figure out the sequential compare when at PCs plus comp infrastructure help me to understand the percent of the represents thinking around maybe wrong with guess trying to get a a to why you the miss in is to be so much larger than those two bucket in the mess in me take the part of the and can add in if he to if you at our revenue a a percentage of our total is around if you were to include hard drive into add a few point so you be under in upper single digit If you at wireless infrastructure last it about of our revenue so obviously combined there you’re in the midteen give you an idea of what impact is Again a of walked through the math of the euro an example last of our revenue down in Europe about a of so to is transacted in euro and again if you have any additional comment on the impact of the euro to is what you’re trying to ask whether the average ROE we experienced on our billion in about for the euro about and for planning purpose we’re using into it is to be bit of a a quarteroverquarter ROE impact from standpoint a it relates to the euro Right now we’re anticipating it again to be flat follow on in the comp section specifically you were doing a bit of pruning what’s the product portfolio and wondering if any of the pruning you’ve done is being reflected in of either sequential or yearoveryear growth rate do you feel that’s not a factor a you at the guide we don’t believe is a factor if you at the impact wireless infrastructure we sell more product than we do embedded or the custom ASIC product it actually hit both embedded and other Of course you can see the impact more significantly in embedded and other because it’s a higher percentage of revenue again we’ve a good position across to most of the major OEMs there and so what we’re seeing is a change in chip and demand we’ll go to the next please go now to with wondering if you can give u a handle on where you see OpEx next given the revenue short fall OpEx up about a expected both the and recall in the we typically down a bit on OpEx because of seasonality for holiday and so on the absence of those seasonality those holiday in the along with our annual pay and benefit increase traditionally drive are OpEx up over Those pay and benefit increase kick it in so it’s only two months’ worth the OpEx in well have the full three month so you see a very slight increase to the Got it you helpful my follow up again on currency you are pointing to sort of direct translation effect had other player who have pointed to demand destruction from currency wondering if you can give u your point of view on what seeing more broadly in the market Not to your revenue but also for your customer are you seeing any sort of broad based can destruction because of the currency moment talked about there is no way for u to point to some and demonstrate evidence actually have occurring the entire industry tends to price in dollar for the indiscernible of what’s being shipped it not allow u other alternative it would seem for customer from the demand standpoint not to might not be a order knock on affect what you’re alluding to and we don’t see any way we can quantify with any confidence there are always plus and minus with currency movement it impossible for u to quantify them you go to the next please go now to with afternoon and you for taking my the timing when you start to see the weakness you talked about in the and given the softer than seasonal outlook would you have to ratchet down your wafer manufacturing fab manufacturing activity or wafer structuring in yes well be lightening up the wafer start in would caution you though pulling back on the wafer start doesn’t necessarily mean have a direct impact on our inventory the work in process in become finished good in so we would expect our inventory to still go up a bit in even though we pull back on wafer start a bit great for then up nicely yearoveryear despite the headwind and embedded up only which is a significant deceleration yearoveryear versus the prior assuming the embedded weakness primarily driven by DSPs given the muted wireless infrastructure spending environment correct impacted by the wireless infrastructure and in fact if you at the business of embedded we had good growth in microcontrollers and connectivity both processor were down for the exact reason you identified now you well go to next please now go to with other avenue to get of the broad based demand trend are you seeing any sort of difference in demand pattern from your distributor customer relative to the OEM customer are they getting any more nervous or excited and willing to carry inventory and realize the week of inventory data you gave before but from a booking perspective any color be helpful Ill add offer on is on yearoveryear booking were up by of our revenue go through DSP so clearly were seeing one of the booking coming to the DSP channel inventory level are carrying over one and half week down about a week from a so they continue to carry lean level of inventory largely because they we carry Inventory and consignment and we also maintain very short lead time since we have for number of year now and so we get inventory quickly is reliable for them when they order with u from those kind of element space there is no rule again sign we can look at say there is demand destruction on because of ROE they can’t indiscernible there have to add if you at our resale overall very consistent with our combined and embedded sale they were in the upper single digit very close to the same number following a quick one to make have all the moving part it sound in an answer to your prior you OpEx be upper you also sound utilization be down it seems putting together with your earnings guidance it implies margin is to be down at bit is one is may directionally correct is the cause of the margin simply utilization or is there some mix effect also need to appreciate may be missing the mix effect there don’t expect much change in the margin you for go to the next please go now to with the market seeing weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure do you is an inventory or demand problem and guess what is we other supplier into the about return sort of better in seasonal half a you get inventory correction where do you stand on of all the wireless infrastructure market is been notoriously been very choppy a you at demand over the number of year there is usually a significant build is OEMs are planning to bid for the operator spend and then it typically surprise u and there is an overbuild occurs so one of begets the other the wireless infrastructure market obviously long is a good market for u and a good position in and a the number down they up again one day the side only a of percent of our revenue so we have any unique insight on we believe weakness is due to the inventory that’s created because there wasnt a much demand in the XP refresh cycle but nothing beyond and we’ll see how the rest of this go before we start making prediction on the back half we’ll take a one at a you have a follow on and guess specifically you had mentioned the restricting you did but specifically you did cut back on RD and macro based station and wondering if there is any anything directly would point to decision versus revenue seeing ours are completely separate from Again when we at those market they’re very long tailed in product cycle continue to make investment they are not at the same rate we were making five and year and not unlike what done in other market a they’ve began to mature there is other area of wireless infrastructure look it be very promising growth small cell and we continue to invest very at a very high level there while we have very revenue so we would believe to throttle investment based on the opportunity overall for and go to the next go now to with and have two question had a about the channel did you see any meaningful cancel this and had a follow up on the inventory saw cancellation continue to run veryvery low a we’ve for a number of quarter now and same is true of reschedules too by the way also veryvery low no pattern indicating change of demand there great then you inventory is to be again you in despite loading being down guess my is what do you is sort of the now you had a of quarter to about the mix when do you is the right normalize of inventory and do you were to back down to sort of more normalized during the back half of the are to use the of monitor the effect of all the change been doing with the portfolio and with our operation to model what we is a more appropriate overall of average inventory to carry What we did the prior model which had worked for u quite well of a to day appropriate giving the mix we had but clearly a we moved to more and more consignment a we move to keeping lead time of very short across the abundance of our portfolio faced with we to carry more inventory than we have in the so we’ll be using to run various test on what the appropriate level of inventory are to meet the service metric our customer have to expect of u and then by the we get to early next when we do our capital management update we’ll go ahead and appoint a new model at point in you and go the next now go to with you and wanted to clarify how these two segment comprised of revenue are driving what estimated a a point miss relative to seasonality Are you being conservative in anticipation of may be a fall out in some of your other end market or and not fully incorporating other part of the equation here go ahead and attempted last give the try are several moving part on there when we at and compare on a yearoveryear the ROE alone impact u about from a yearoveryear compare for growth rate Then you go beyond and continuing weakness and wireless infrastructure and PCs and also the absence of the benefit the DLP had a which meaningful due to the World Cup and other large sporting event fact we saw some of impact of DLP already begin to occur in the a we mentioned DLP down quite a bit in you those kind of headwind ROE wireless infrastructure and DLP and then the rest of the portfolio basically doing fine because it’s simple with what we’re been seeing in the economy for the last few quarter for the clarification wanted to ask you about MA there been a you have a lot of activity over the last and when about MA certainly been part of your DNA over the last to year you about how you are thinking about MA specifically in this environment relative to buying back your own stock our MA posture haven’t changed at all meaning most important is to the extent we considered an acquisition is to be something fit into our strategy consistent with our portfolio interest and something we can generate longterm return on therefore access cash flow for our shareholder If it of pass the strategy test then it to pas the number test frankly we have a hard with many of the company are out there making those of number work Contrast to when we bought National back in at a when all some indiscernible stock price were considerably lower and you can certainly see in retrospect a very good return for our shareholder we tend to be very disciplined on continue to be disciplined on Buying back our own share right now especially a long a they trade below the intrinsic value of the is also it continues to be a good return for our shareholder especially from a cash flow perspective now go to with mentioned if you at the portfolio the rest of the is doing fine outside of the factor highlighted if you go back to history and at such a sharp destruction used word on the exchange rate when do you expect to manifest itself in other part of the for instance the distributor in Europe and other piece get indiscernible go into for instance in industrial and auto what currency issue tell u on front then had a quick followup had some clever insight on but am afraid from an experience standpoint actually do not recall my experience in this capacity and Ive been in this role for a very long now seeing currency drop this sharply in this short of of have not history from which to trying to get a reference point to answer your were all to have to wait and see where this take u the encouraging part is especially in industrial and automotive is the silicon content in those space continues to increase yearoveryear and so despite ROE impact that’s to slowdown the silicon content increase in those space frankly if you at the pricing of those and equipment’s the cost of a chip into is irrelevant to an automotive customer if you at the more macro effect and especially where we see growth someone out there in auto and industrial it doesnt seem likely we would see a sharp impact in demand caused because of ROE may be other factor may lead to of difference to add a many argument putting pressure on the demand there is a many argument it could help demand on the other side so it tough to be able to quantify each of those into those impact followup this is a clarification in response to Rosss did you margin be flat and if so the way to about it is factory loading go down in the non millimeter and millimeter is continuing to ramp so offset lower factory loading a safe way to about it is mix on there but clearly we continue to ramp up millimeter which is much more cost effective for u and so in balance we don’t expect much change in margin go now to with Capital to follow on mixed shift seeing can you possibly give u the utilization on your overall factory base and the utilization seeing in mil then have a followup on the utilization we typically would about a something drastic occurred so won’t go into right now you on a capital management call did discus for RFAB in particular we have the majority of the equipment necessary to support the buildout of factory to a revenue and into we had achieved about worth of build for revenue in support of call roughly utilized but at the same were also converting from it exclusive use by embedded processing to also be able to be used by metal add another of millimeter capacity in you could in a our utilization of millimeter may actually decline but not because of loading because of increase in our capacity have a my followup is when you at the yearonyear growth last clearly you had a nice but with the guidance offered were actually down yearonyear If we at the longterm growth of your is there a point in at which you might adjust what you your longterm growth rate would be such you felt factory consolidation would be part of the equation to drive higher efficiency factory consolidation isn’t on our radar What were interested in is very inexpensive factory acquisition with extremely low carrying cost allows u to grow into it in a very efficient manner been talking about and a better processing combined for an extended of now have been growing at about compound annual growth rate fact even combined for this we closed out they grew another on yearoveryear they continue to grow quite healthy would expect a we move in we’ll at those factory provide u the best cost efficiency and cash flow delivery and keep those operating in load and those to be biased in our note age towards millimeter add to if you at the growth rate in at what’s happened in the overall number are very strong mean if you at our margin you at where our OpEx level are our operating margin with and embedded processing growth this we turned in cash flow our financial performance isn’t predicated on having to hit a certain growth we can do very well in a low growth environment or if thing pick up we can we are in a good position to build to support a well you and we’ll go to the next please now go to with looking back to the weakness in the market you clearly had a fairly seasonal don’t if you saw any slowdown there Intel didn’t then look you’ve figured correction in one if you could apologize if you already answered this within which your high performance and Silicon Valley is still up in and it the dragging it down if so would be down doubledigit Is the right way to at it then a you to Intel is up channel starting to turn around Is it you’re working through some inventory or if there is there any way you can quantify and then of help me with the math a to when do you start to see me take a shot at it and then you ask a follow up Some of we’ve touched on again the weakness we saw had manifested in both in NPCs and in wireless infrastructure don’t how played out at some of our competitor but we do expect to see weakness in obviously our guidance is reflective of don’t if help or if there is part of you’d to ask a clarification or a follow up would ask obviously can sign up for a full forecast so when you at the business of in com clearly they’ve been down for several quarter here or be with the guide to get full growth would require a substantial pick up in the half Do you see these a headwind this for you and if so how much take go ahead and forecast the balance of the in front of each when we get there we could give you a guide one at a you are better equipped than we are to up with analysis to help figure out what the might be and we’ll leave it at and we are now out of I’d to you all for joining u a of this call is on our Web site concludes our you for your',\n",
       "       'take our from with guess if you had to characterize the overall environment now versus a or a would you broadly speaking not much changed were still in this fine roughly seasonal environment have you any change in visibility or your overall you it While it hasnt changed all much there a slight change in our booktobill on a yearoveryear about but frankly because more and more of our order are coming in on consignment booktobill mean le and le about a particular of where our revenue is to summarize our it more steady a she go for the last few year of an economy growing along on a steady and were trying to take advantage of growing a bit faster than and me add the other thing we see If you at our inventory it at a healthy channel inventory are actually down a week a earlier from a under week lead time remain consistent our cancellation and reschedules remain very very low and in addition we continue to deliver our product on for customer those type of thing are always a good indication for the overall environment too Do you have a followup it sound thing are normal seasonal this you give u any of the relative growth rate of your major product line this What expecting between embedded and the other stuff we try to forecast out a on the major product line or even at the point out both of those product line turned in another of market share gain and certainly were working hard to do for another and well have to see how the turn out go next to with Capital the inventory front are we to assume now your visibility now visavis in the is higher also because of a higher percentage is consignment off the disti within give you better visibility Is the right way to about it the day are up versus what your targeted is and not comparable to if we at the last and median then had a quick follow up would necessarily go to improved visibility but we do get would a much more improved or realtime feedback from whats actually on with true end demand for our product and the real benefit of is we can adjust our factory on a realtime whereas a you point out if you went back a number of year we carried far fewer day of inventory the signal a to how fast our product are actually being consumed in the end market also took a lot longer to get to u and so wed respond later Now we can respond much more quickly it le a of improved visibility a it is a of much more realtime feedback a to how fast our product are being consumed for the clarification what meant because we always get into this debate in end cycle about sellin and sellthrough quick is what should we be modeling for CapEx for this you would continue to recommend you assume we average about of our revenue on CapEx on average over multiyear period Some year might be a lighter it this where we came in at about in but on average we expect and how we build our own internal model is from with day when you were talking about OpEx for the you looking back a yearago and how it flowed a a good model and you even mentioned it would be a good model into the calendar Is statement still hold can you help u understand the put and take on OpEx into the especially around some seasonal cost exactly right from to the best way to model is to take a the last is a good starting point typically are up in the midsingle digit from to on OpEx and because of the absence of the holiday period we have in the and the annual startup of pay and benefit increase we have in we might be up a bit more than versus a simply because on higher profitability we are expecting for the we also expect higher variable compensation accrual and so may take our to up a bit higher than what you saw about a have a followon do back to the space maybe you can give u a bit more color because it impressive put up doubledigit growth yearoveryear this against hard compare from the yearago of to what extent do you your market share gain could be accelerating around your consignment effort if you could help me understand a bit better you talked about power leading the way this you help me understand a bit more why the growth seems to be doing much better than some of your peer when you yearoveryear of all it good to have all four of those business contributing to the growth Certainly power is benefiting from a secular trend of thing wanting to run more off of battery and thing do get plugged in becoming more efficient also have a very strong product line there too those thing are helping u to gain share talked about for some it not one of a or embedded processing allows you to gain share is a lot of thing you have to do to be a good and a lot of competitor fit category but other thing the scale of our and reach of our sale force our presence on the web our manufacturing footprint the technology we bring to bear and the breath of the product portfolio it all those thing working together would add one more there too is our strategy of discussed for a year now of buying our capacity ahead of our need and always have an ample capacity quite frankly give our customer new and old increased confidence we have adequate capacity to meet their demand requirement and they see u consistently maintaining short lead time another element help u be able to win market share versus some of the other competitor were up against go next to with afternoon and great job on the quarterly you for taking u to the OpEx stepup here in Now with most of the embedded in Japan restructuring behind you continued discipline on the team part how should we about the OpEx trend beyond the heard you mention your embedded OpEx of holding flattish but how should we about the overall beyond the best way to about is we discussed it back in on average we would expect our OpEx to run between and of revenue in a weak market it might be at the and in stronger market it would be in the performing quite well in our market right now and so seeing OpEx down fact most recently in the half of we were running around of revenue and so would you would want to model u in the lower half of a you try to about how much our OpEx spend be in have a followon Surveillance you for thought directionally on utilization level here in the seasonality in your would assume it down again given the booktobill ratio and the revenue guidance for Is also how we should directionally about margin a well the way you need to about utilization is by definition because we buy capacity ahead of we by definition be operating in an underutilized environment versus our maximum capacity theoretical capacity aside because of manufacturing cycle time the material were starting in the especially a we move into the of the is destined for shipment your utilization tends to proceed the moving into a to what your expectation are and a the for the last year now and normally for u is a growth compared to the we adjust our factory loading accordingly to our expectation to revenue expectation go next to with to follow up on margin it look to me your implied guidance for margin is maybe maybe a higher so low it down a bit on revenue are down slightly with inventory a higher you give u some feeling of if you want to give number at least some of the driver for margin into in particular what are you planning to do with the inventory on your own balance sheet trend necessarily have want to get into the GPM per se me a bit more about what our inventory level might and how might drive u have an inventory forecast per se but given the growth in consignment and the typically seasonally strong we would expect our factory loading to increase a we move through the a mentioned a moment of the thing to keep in mind when you adjust your faculty loading if your quarterly loading are for the following quarter expectation then if you about the pattern of movement through the you take your loading Coming into our loading would be dropping coming into the and into our loading would start to increase during the so always to have a bit of a lag when you try to track the GPM follows with which is what you are asking for there more importantly what we see is our margin we expect to continue to improve along with our cash flow By virtue of the fact and embedded processing continue to become a larger portion of our total revenue and by virtue of the fact mm manufacturing continues to be a larger portion of our total production a we go and both of those result in both higher margin and higher cash flow my follow up to touch on the tax rate your guidance for next a higher than your guidance for which wanted to verify is the only real source of the higher profit versus expectation you had told u before to tax every incremental dollar of profit around at the incremental tax rate correct fact our tax rate in our guidance a you they rounded down to actually came in a bit higher than if it werent for the RD credit and so were looking at it rounding up to a we move into exactly right you model what you would expect our earnings and fallthrough to be you should tax at approximately Delta profit a it come through during the Ill point out too not assume the reinstatement of the RD tax credit we for If reinstate would be between and point of tax benefit go next to with of when at your result versus consensus estimate you did better in your core and embedded segment there some shortfall in the other sale which are actually down yearonyear they were down almost last and believe you mentioned some loss of ASIC wondering what is the right way or to model this it is a very profitable for you is still a decent size and in the you have mentioned it could be flattish plusminus or so conceptually what is the right way to model the If you back at the other the would point out is it a calculated revenue and the seasonally strong backtoschool season happened but in and those tend to be the seasonally strongest to biggest transition of course is due to the change of If you overall you can at the component fit of other is DLP and described a a more steady and one might have some described a wild card of new opportunity majority of is in front projector a well a in cinema and some what we call pico projector or small form factor projector make up the revenue there is some opportunity of automotive and other embedded opportunity could provide growth in the future next biggest piece of revenue is calculator and been would flat maybe slightly down over then royalty have run steady about to a and a good to and then we have ASIC transition over to EP over is some in communication infrastructure and we believe move over you net all stuff together and we the other be flat maybe up or down percentage point a described in the you also asked about yearoveryear recall last still had about or so of wireless revenue it in this is essentially zero your biggest decline on a yearoveryear a my followon back to your core do you you have the right scale in your embedded to take op margin into the when at the three area within processor connectivity microcontrollers how would you rank against the best competitor in trying to understand how you can grow gain share improve margin while keeping investment flattish while all your competitor are all investing in their respective business you Ill leave it to you to analyze the competitor Ill speak to how is doing may recall back in late early timeframe we significantly stepped up our investment in particular in order to accelerate our product introduction and therefore begin to accelerate our revenue growth and if you take a at whats happened over the last a mentioned in his opening remark nine quarter of sequential or continuous yearoveryear growth strategy paid off those product are beginning to take a you those kind of product tend to have very long shelf life so we expect to see more of the same on Now while we took spending down this a a result of the restructuring action we announced this a we didnt eliminate them amount we are investing is still quite high and why the operating profit is still not quite where we entitlement take u to we continue to invest at quite a healthy not at the you saw u invest in in the prior few year those combined the high level of investment an expanding product portfolio from heavier level of investment in the prior few year have all given u very strong growth in and continue to give u growth and quite frankly based upon some of the best in class performance you can at out there we have shall we expectation similar to at least a well a those company are operating and would also add if you at our product portfolio of microcontrollers two architecture there where well introduce new product with new interface and meet new standard of lot of our competitor have half a dozen or a dozen different architecture where theyve to spread their RD investment over we can be very efficient with in addition if you remember a part of the wireless restructuring we brought over those connectivity product already had a significant investment in those wireless technology were supporting nearly a dozen different wireless standard and group is focused on growing the top line rather than having to develop baseline technology go next to with lot of great question asked already one is around the long goal you might have Auto is of low double digit personal electronic is almost although coming down Is the goal from a diversification standpoint to continue to increase in particular auto subcategory and decrease the personal electronics category over the next two or three year goal is not necessarily to try to optimize mix per se would if you of personal electronics a an example well for place where we can find sustainable revenue with a differentiated position if you at some of our largest customer we sell product into well sell several hundred device into those customer and those product could be anywhere from down to and oftentimes they may have life live from one generation of a product to another those are the type of opportunity we try to for in a space Comms Equipment Now certainly from an incremental investment profile if we had an extra to spend and we had an opportunity to spend in either industrial or automotive those product in general tend to have longer life cycle and better characteristic may see an increase in investment then lastly would add those two market have the secular trend you are well aware of well benefit from a the rest of the industry and of course we hope to benefit disproportionately from those investment Do you have a followon guess Ill stick on topic personal electronics been coming down but your view would be it not a function of an intentional effort on the part of more a function of the other business you have or happen to be better long growth area and it naturally coming down Is the right characterization even more than if you backed out legacy wireless youll see it actually been fairly stable a a mix change in percentage is more driven by the strategic decision to exit one portion of the go next to with also wanted to ask about the end market breakdown you provide If at where you were a and there some reclassification but it looked industrial went from in to in and personal assistance from to Those swing seem dramatic wanted to see if there some change in the way you were looking at the breakdown continued to refine our understanding of our customer and market and better tool and software if you go out to our web now youll actually see two year of history we have out there a well a the identified sector those market made up go next to with to follow up to Viveks discussion on embedded processing and expense control it the flip side of you a bit about what looking at before you would start to invest more in the clear you want higher operating margin than you have now but what are the thing is looking at before it commit to incremental investment in would were quite a way off before we even have to entertain a focus for the next few year is managing the total spend and driving top line growth and frankly if we begin to see top line growth then begin to net the of bottomline result we can see happening in other player in space at point in we might entertain increasing our spending but not until then then the followup is taking another swing at something brought up which is longerterm growth on a least in my model calendar the in the last four or five where embedded processing and had similar growth rate and they were both double digit philosophically a you at those two business which have had very different history are there reason why they should have materially different growth rate given they are both closer to operating on more optimal level should they be fairly similar when you begin to longer at the growth rate and the potential of those business would start with what do you believe the semiconductor market grow on have held the position we the semiconductor market roughly grows at twice the rate of GDP is some violently agree with this and some violently disagree with basic assumption whatever assumption is we both and Embedded Processing are big enough portion of the market they grow inline with If you at those business certainly over the last five year they both have continued to gain share and we believe were continuing to invest and a lot of room to gain share in fact in market share and of Embedded Processing around percentage point lot of headroom to do and gained sometimes more than in market share on a given still have to have everyone report before all the final number are in but were confident well gain share again this do you have anything to add to one would recommend you maybe take a at If you do at those two segment and embedded processing their quarterly growth rate the point you were making They can vary quite markedly from one another If you at the two of them on a yearoveryear they actually are much more correlated than you might expect Theyre both gaining share a mentioning and are both growing quite nicely on a yearoveryear if you do some measurement for those two segment on yearoveryear growth rate and compare back over the last half dozen quarter or so you might be pleasantly surprised to see they grow similarly to each other go next to with a you go into your capital management call next week could you u what your historical philosophy been on levering the balance sheet to drive shareholder value what talked about on debt we have debt on the balance sheet be there until because is when the last of the current outstanding bond matures and our attitude towards debt is it continue to be part of the balance sheet when the economics make and for u economics making mean if we can borrow at interest rate we perceive to be below what we expect our inflation rate to be or correspondingly at le than our dividend yield then we a good deal on behalf of our shareholder and so be the of parameter we at a we continue to decide how much debt to carry on the balance sheet and a bond mature do actually have a of debt maturing in have maturing in and maturing in August of have a followon you for color the operating margin are about point higher than the embedded we about the potential profitability of the embedded are there structural reason why embedded profitability could not equal the profitability longerterm you the simple answer in my mind is it difficult for u to find evidence of somebody in the marketplace outside of who been able to perform at those of level the economics are such itll be very attractive to be a great place for u to be in but it doesnt quite get up to par of what you see in is quite unique in what it can produce for company and for shareholder who all own those company we do go next to with and a again on margin and what the possible headroom is guess if you at the embedded up to but if you at some of the wellrun peer in space theyre doing sort of mid maybe ask a bit different way is there any reason why you cant get the embedded margin up to the mid is no reason why we cant do made good progress we still have work to do but we believe we can get into with revenue growth and so what were planning to do Theyve a good start nine quarter in a row of yearonyear growth and are making progress towards moving operating margin higher Do you have a followon do yes then relative to the inventory certainly some of it is structural a you indicated but is any of the rise in inventory related to your perception could be a bit better than seasonal would it too early for u to call the entire Right now were focused on the inventory staged is designed to support our need and then a we adjust our factory loading in inventory we build be designed to deal with our need a mentioned earlier we expect we be ramping up our factory a we go through in support of and when we get to the end of the we find out how much inventory were holding at point in go to our last from with Capital guess if could dig deep into some of the result reported and maybe some of the outlook you might have by key market out there investor are interested to hear what seeing in the and server power market a well a maybe the disk drive market if you could offer some color on what seeing in the communication market a well those are maybe not overly material to the story but they are to investor in general me share some end market trend may address some of those issue maybe not down at the you are quite asking you were talking about PCs and those would fall into our personal electronics product a yearonyear they were up despite the decline had mentioned earlier in legacy wireless and growth led by mobile phone If you at industrial and want to point out when we about industrial been very intentional about how to measure and it different than when investor about the industrial market the sector a dozen sector make up industrial and they include thing factory automation and control medical healthcare fitness building automation smart grid motor drive display those type of thing the full list is out on our up led by medical and healthcare fitness Appliance factory automation and smart grid were also up from a Comms equipment up due to wireless infrastructure and then enterprise system were up primarily due to projector with you have a followon guess for my followon what are you seeing in term of any shift in the competitive landscape investor are somewhat concerned over what were seeing in China from an investment standpoint Is there anything in your market seeing would point to any change in the competitive landscape a it relates to China in particular because mentioned there been in China for a very long now have over a dozen sale and RD site there have both a wafer fabrication facility and an assembly test site there addition we have thousand of customer buying thousand of part and consequently become a very important supplier to a large number of Chinese company across a very diverse set of market we see China a continuing to be a great opportunity for regardless of any of the competitive environment out there and our goal is to operate in China we do in the rest of the world which is to make ourselves an integral part of their success and an indispensable supplier and a great shall a long way were a long way into already and we feel good about our position for and you all for joining u to talking to you again on our Capital of this call is on our today you for your',\n",
       "       'you sir come from with go ahead sir afternoon for me ask the guess my be on OpEx you are well ahead of sort of your expected annualized saving of with the restructuring action do OpEx trend into the if you at RD a a percent of rev now below is a structural change in the model and how worried should be at what scale you should be investing on RD for future growth understand you are still spending absolutely a lot more money than most of your peer but tough to see someone with your margin and RD a a percent below a there were a in there so me see if can remember them all Starting with OpEx and trend the clearly OpEx down quarteroverquarter largely a a result of some of the restructuring action we previously announced a well a ongoing cost discipline in all the various business across you into if you go back and take a at a your best gauge to take a at the and even for matter typically see OpEx is lower in the due to holiday and vacation addition this we expect a further benefit of another of cost to out a a result of the restructuring we announced on the embedded processing part of of annualized saving you were mentioning fact were running ahead of of annualized saving right now up to beyond the total RD spend a a percent of revenue again whats more important is not how much you spent but how well you spent it the best indicator and how well you are spending is whats happening to your market share a a result of the product were introducing into the market our case if you take a at through the last full period we reported on our total RD spend is up over most importantly RD is a result in product where we have continually gained share again it le a of how much you spend and a lot more how well you spend it and spend it on thing customer carry about you have a followup quickly you give guidance or revenue when at the embedded in the it up only about which is bit weaker than had been modeling and of a to what you might have driven given some of your peer have talked about sort of slowdown in the half of from a macro perspective did any of play into the embedded in the you me take if you at the growth rate between and embedded processing you can see a lot of quarter they wont grow the same if you at both of those business they have different end market exposure and it those end market exposure explain most of the difference in those number and the part of our yeah did basically the overall environment impacting the growth there and I’d no isn’t in those number Basically forecast is given off of the order we received from our customer you we go to the next please sir next is with Capital Capital you very much on the overall demand environment is a lot of confusion out there but it seems thing have slowed down so wanted your perspective the you have given u certain thing a you at such a cancellation and so on and so forth also within frame of reference if you could please walk u through your disti consignment versus nonconsignment then how would you compare to somebody who claim they are sellthrough so they see a slowdown before a or so before others then had a very quick followup so a of point in there is point out all of our distributor provide u with a pointofsale reporting and we get information on a very regular regardless of how the revenue is recognized we see whats on from a distributor resale standpoint you touched on the current environment and we want to be guarded on trying to take a position for the industry on where that’s we can point to what we see If of step through those our inventory on our book is at day is within our target model If you at our channel inventory those were essentially unchanged from last They are at a very lean at over week leadtimes have been consistent and would low cancellation and reschedules remain very low so nothing changing on front then a we have grown over these last few quarter been able to support growth and keep delivering our product on at very very high service level our operation continue to execute at high and then get to the last part of your what percentage of our revenue go through distribution and what percentage is supported by consignment the one is about of our revenue go through the distribution channel and about of is supported on consignment a we pointed out in our remark increased by about from a had a of conversion go on this would we are not done with actually expect additional conversion happen and over the next or so so we expect percentage actually increase you have followup Capital a quick followup on the embedded operating margin you have had a steady increase whats the right way to about how do you get to North of Is it a matter of focusing on the right product mix and getting ramped up or is it something beyond you take one embedded processing there our margin have been continuously improving over these last few quarter and we would expect further improvement Recall mentioned earlier in the call we would expect another or so of cost to out of and most of out of embedded processing would add from this point and talked about this last of quarter the amount of spend embedded processing is sufficient doesn’t need to increase anymore What the focus is revenue growth and that’s what this is about entire team been very focused on believe they recorded their eight in a row of yearoveryear revenue growth so they clearly are working on the right metric to make start to deliver profitability at the we expected to at you go to the next please next is from with for taking my question want to dig into the embedded processor margin again a bit had about in OpEx out from to had revenue in the up a bit or mostly flat Margins were only up a bit all of cost in theory would have expected to out of embedded processing why weren’t the embedded processing margin up more doesn’t seem all of those cost saving actually flowed through the margin this they all flowed through the margin but not all through embedded processing Recall those action incorporate both embedded processing a well a action in Japan which drove margin a well Even with at the EP you did see about a fall through on delta revenue seeing it through but do keep in mind Japan start spreading on some of the other business a well Got it it That’s helpful my followup if can dig into the margin bit both for this and next for this you came in a bit high guess only the revenue upside or there something else in term of mix or other cost saving push it up then for next depending on how far you are guiding OpEx down it feel to me you are guiding margin implicitly flat to up in and of revenue are down and typically your margin be down in a well if you could give u any sort of feeling for what the driver for next ought to be in term of mix offsetting revenue decline would be very helpful clearly the extra revenue came through and it quite rich also had a slightly better mix of overall product were shipped in the combined gave u new record profit margin of we into would not characterize our guidance suggesting margin go up be reducing loading some in the on a seasonal Hence you can expect margin be down a bit not very much but down a bit depending on how building your model there wouldn’t assume margin increase in Got it you and we go to the next next is with you for taking my and congrats on the solid quarterly market have been focused on Europe and China a source of potential weakness the same the team done a solid job on diversification and maybe that’s what it is the diversity of forging a more stable revenue profile at the margin can you about the overall health by geography Have you any sign of weakening above the normal seasonal trend you would normally expect during or would if you at what happened regionally yearoveryear Asia and Europe were both up while the even and Japan down a bit all the region were up with Asia and Europe up the most if you specifically of China and how resale had done there we had looked into resale continued to be solid a we closed out the that’s basically what we saw have a followup absolutely you for gave u some trend in OpEx into the should we about OpEx a we move into the half of next wont comment on half but give you some thought on best way to analyze this could take a at what happened from to of the most recent coming out of do have seasonal increase in OpEx a we go from to typically because of an absence of vacation we have in and the partial implementation of our annual pay and benefit increase occur in they you should expect those to be up and you can take a at again this to get a rough idea a about how much increased by in percentage term would add the a we indicated before pointed out we are expecting about more saving in at point be essentially complete on those announced action we basically be have a seasonal impact had mentioned right you go to the next please is with for taking the start off with a bigger picture done a very good job of looking and being proactive taking action to either prune lower margin revenue stream such a wireless or identifying opportunity for cost saving such a the optimization program this you ahead how much further room is there for a similar such optimization effort Are we at a point where the model is getting very close to being optimized a we from an optimization standpoint the one talked about so far have been more about where we might have trimmed area had opportunity perhaps not quite a attractive a other area perhaps one of the area least appreciated a people at on a go is the impact continued delta revenue on millimeter is to have for u cost structure to build on millimeter is very attractive so incremental revenue on millimeter we expect to produce not only higher margin but also higher level of total cash on delta revenue have a follow on do you you mentioned the strength in power management on yearonyear Was it similarly strong and what specifically is driving strength on a sequential if you at our it up primarily due to High Volume Logic a well a Power Though we did see growth from all four business High Performance and Silicon Valley also grew you see a bit of difference there again power continue to strong in both comparison you go to the next please next come from Chin with Chin for taking my question wanted to draw down bit on the embedded processing in particular between microprocessor and microcontrollers and guess DSPs and application processor you about some of the trend you saw in especially from any guess communication equipment exposure you have embedded processing a you grew from a driven by microcontrollers connectivity and processor each growing by about the same amount again a pointed out the eight in a row of yearoveryear growth Sequentially revenue a better than even connectivity up and processor and microcontrollers were about even you have follow on Chin term of margin wondering if this there is an opportunity for you to take advantage of building any strategic inventory for certain product you have good turnover and hence maybe further optimize margin a bit in a seasonally slower we do on ongoing That’s one of the way we’re able to keep sort of leadtime for the overwhelming majority of our part to six week or le fact we build the stock not necessarily build the order Meaning we maintain a stock of inventory such we can always have short leadtimes from our customer from a strategic standpoint is done have a bit of ebb and flow you point out when we have lower loading in certain it give u chance to build up on feed extra part on don’t there is a whole lot of opportunity to do to impact the margin were doing to impact customer service would also add if you take the combined way we are managing inventory now and were being very intentional targeted program depending on how quickly inventory turn you take plus the open capacity and the combination of those two thing and been able to execute at very high level and deliver our product on to customer so we not only having low leadtimes but also delivering product when you make a commitment to a customer combination of those thing are what customer would to have you move on to the next please we have with you you about where your fab utilization are now qualitatively and there still an underutilization charge to a part of these number on the underutilization charge the answer is yes there are were not talking about those anymore and the reason is of straight found analyst and some inventory where on a conclusion because we had underutilization increase in our utilization would be the maximum amount by which we could increase our overall profitability if we put revenue into those factory and that’s an incomplete answer you our stated strategy is to invest in our capacity ahead of demand by definition mean we have open capacity and underutilization cost purpose of providing ahead of demand is to purchase capacity with a cash a possible the utilization charge is mostly a noncash charge and it tends to mix the point our objective is to maximizing cash flow for reason you havent heard u commenting on or quantifying underutilization charge this few quarter and unlikely to in the future unless there is some material change cause the better understanding of whats on add the last we had stated our endtoend capacity it in the if you want to get a qualitative feel of where capacity is you can annualize our quarterly revenue and put it against number and it get you into the zip code you have a follow on you for term could you give u an update on the base station market you continue to be strong anything you are seeing from end market if at the communication market overall and would from a yearonyear standpoint it up primarily due to wireless infrastructure while it down basically we saw in a a seasonal pause in the you very much… you we go to the next please next is with of of you for taking my mentioned a very interesting on improving output from your millimeter fab and wondering if you could give u some more color around what percentage of your start are moving to fab more importantly what implies for margin example in the you have mentioned about fall through on margin a you increase the loading on millimeter what do to number over the next several quarter or year don’t to give you a detailed quantification of nature What would is talked in about from the geometrics alone the chip cost itself about lower on millimeter than it is on Not to mention you also get better yield result and so on so you get a number of different benefit what we are seeing happening is proportionally more and more new product were releasing are being released on to millimeter which mean a we out over the next two three four year more and more of our revenue be sourced off of millimeter which inherently mean it lower cost which should allow u to incrementally increase our margin a well a our importantly our cash flow Beyond don’t have any specific give you at this point in do want to introduce confidence to people because it been underestimated a to how important to continued progress of Got it follow on of the is on the end market mix believe you mentioned comp strong on yearonyear wondering if you could give u your end market mix overall for and how do you see those trend playing out in you on a yearonyear our revenue growth due to coms equipment industrial and automotive a mentioned before each of which grew and contributed to growth by about the same amount Enterprise Systems also up while revenue in personnel electronics declined due to legacy wireless product if you of go down one step in each side of of each one of those industrial about a dozen sector of industrial a talked to different investor over the last few month and a we are traveling around it becomes clear to u our definition of industrial isn’t a well understood year we used to define it a what it wasn’t meaning it wasn’t coms equipment or it wasn’t automotive or it wasn’t other thing now very intentional definition about a dozen different sector make up thing appliance and building automation and display and pointofsale product factory automation industrial transportation medical healthcare fitness lighting motor drive power infrastructure thing very very broad but very when you on yearonyear we had growth in nearly all of those sector with most of the sector actually providing doubledigit growth actually led by medical and healthcare fitness and factory automation again we saw growth very broad based Automotive five sector of and Ill also point those sector are actually out on our of people are interested doubledigit in all the sector but led by passive safety and infotainment Coms equipment a mentioned up due to wireless infrastructure Personnel electronic down due to legacy wireless product and if you take out we did see growth in and notebook and mobile phone and partially offset by some weakness we saw in gaming then the enterprise system that’s part of is where our DLP product sit and up due to projector stop there you have a followup of my… you very much go to the next so much for next is with for taking my is historically when you saw leadtimes stretch for some of your competitor not even if you are only stayed stable you would see not only double ordering at your competitor but also double ordering at a well wondering if you something is changed structurally with how are running the or how industrial operates might have changed dynamic don’t speak for the industry but speak for and of go back to comment we made earlier a result of u taking an approach whereby we intentionally invested capacity before we needed and therefore always have more capacity needed for quarter allows u to be able to build inventory in a much more thoughtful fashion than we have in the consequence of been not only have been able to maintain leadtimes for the preponderance of our product that’s six week or le for several year now also been able to maintain a very high of on delivery to our customer against those leadtimes when you put together what for is it a different way whereby we are managing our manufacturing footprint and how we utilize manufacturing for purpose of managing inventory it relates to double ordering again one of the biggest thing tends to be evident when double ordering begin to popup a you start seeing cancellation or reschedulings beginning to ramp up do not see and we have not for some now the strategy whereby we have capacity ahead of demand and we use thoughtfully to make we can maintain relatively low leadtimes is severing well to satisfying our customer at least a it relates to demand for our product have a followup do that’s helpful the followup is actually on topic about the leadtimes earlier in the script you delivering you are focused on delivering higher level of customer service then you you followed up with saying we are keeping leadtimes consistently low guess trying to reconcile when you delivering higher level of customer service are you do you you have your leadtimes over maybe a longer of have end theyre structurally shorter are you delivering them more consistently at a shorter have to reconcile when you what is the higher of customer service What is the improvement have been you for clarification it’s a real good when we referred of we at a bunch of different customer service metric is how many line item are we shipping on and had some very intentional initiative have been set up to be able to ensure is a good solid number and we are taking advantage of both the capacity and our inventory to ensure we are consistently delivering on so that’s one of the metric we at and that’s what we mean by customer service it not changing those leadtimes but keeping them stable and then delivering product when we saw well deliver them the combination of those two thing and we go to the next please next come from with good afternoon for taking my back on margin if you could go through what drove the offside versus your guidance then obviously sustaining Is there anything doesn’t repeat in such and it sound you can grow it off this space want to make heard right the guidance actually we are up a bit from guidance not a huge amount what we have bit more revenue through importantly we also have a slightly better mix of product we ship to our customer so combined gave u a slightly higher margin than previous expected then on a go again mix continues to be in our favor a we go and so consequently a we into our margin continue to be quite strong importantly because of the rather unique situation we have with millimeter manufacturing capacity we have significant opportunity to continue to drive not improved margin but importantly good cash flow Again you some of the thing we do millimeter do want to make point of having it a lot more of our revenue coming from catalog part which inherently tend to have more attractive margin characteristic have increasing portion of our revenue coming from industrial and automotive space and those three concept are important Catalog part industrial automotive tend to have very nice long revenue stream which mean we have plenty of to figure out and maximize our cost efficiency from production standpoint and maximize our revenue and cash flow off Now increasing customer diversity our dependence on any one customer and therefore of the risk to our loading or cash flow generation are diminished perhaps also very importantly we have a sale force we estimate to be three to four time larger than our nearest competitor and those folk are becoming increasingly productive so were beginning to get a lot more revenue per sale person which mean we can grow revenue without having to grow OpEx a fast a revenue growing Those thing combined not only help our margin but also definitely help our cash flow you have a followup for a big picture you already answered this but wanted to make missed anything had some company referenced part still weakness mean would your result are normal if not even better than normal Are you seeing any area are weak and you are offsetting with share gain or strength elsewhere your perspective or are you not seeing any weakness at all anywhere yeah you draw the conclusion from the number obviously the result are solid the outlook is consistent with the order and our visibility into what customer are telling u they want from a consignment standpoint and from a share gain standpoint had multiple year now where we have had gain share it always hard to tell in any one particular picking up share but when you back over a you can see trend we believe in our number there share gain but be careful and anyone to be able to point out you well go to the next please next come from with for me ask a guess the one nobody asked about thus far is other did a bit better than had expected you broke down what the yearoveryear and sequentials with the sub bucket in the other two segment you do for the other a well if it is DLP give u a description on is there some seasonality in we need to appreciate so on a yearonyear again other even saw a decline in legacy wireless product and mostly offset by the growth in DLP product a sequential me finish yearonyear If you beyond calculator a well a custom ASIC were up and royalty were down slightly revenue up due to growth in calculator and DLPs Royalties were flat and custom ASIC down a bit all of those business are performing well and if you at DLP they are typically stronger in the back half of the in but would is executing well we at longer describe it several wildcard growth opportunity If you at most of the it be centered up in the front projector youll typically see in office and school and government building but and it also a solid cinema but from a broader standpoint it some opportunity of automotive a well a some embedded opportunity there a well Pico a well the Pico projector a well do you have a followup do you were helpful in giving u some balance around the OpEx and looking at prior year and how thing have dropped seasonally due to vacation et cetera in both the and in the doing the other direction you give u a bit of a harder number on what typical percentage change quartertoquarter Looking back in the you have had a number of restructuring program make it a bit difficult to parse out what seasonality and what is restructuring driven in both the of the you actually pointed to the last to transition with the idea a good one for you to at because in fact the timing of the announcement for the embedded process and Japan restructuring you may remember we announced in of this so we hadnt even begun the activity yet the the underlying cost in there is fairly clean from a competitive standpoint between and and so use a your figure of merit ph to trying to figure where we go in helpful clarification well go to the next please next is with Capital Capital for taking my Capital for taking my Congrats on a real strong result here If could maybe attack high one have been in the very acquisitive so much so you rebuild your whole model through acquisition you maybe about your appetite to maybe add some debt onto your already leveraged balance sheet what it would take for you to at another significant deal it not may be there two idea in your one on MA one on debt on the MA front a you point out we have been quite willing to take on MA activity when it make and our definition of what make firstly to be a strategic fit meaning it to make for why we want to take the we at potential MA in the future it most likely to be biased towards and towards item with catalog part service the industrial or automotive space may be others but those are the most likely area we would at If it turn out it check off strategic fit standpoint and of course well have to take a at the number and make the price we would pay met what mean by is not necessarily what it market cap is but the market we have to pay on top of total cost would be accretive to our lack or way the average cost of capital in the two to four timeframe there the several test we go through and we make a termination on acquisition it relates to debt a you we have taken on debt to support acquisition in the having the balance sheet to support those kind of strategic initiative are important and a worthwhile for u to maintain for maximum flexibility a we move and so a we out in and even at the last of year while we have been issuing new debt also been retiring older debt and retiring a bit faster than what been issuing so were taking our whole debt level down having the result of generally slowly opening the balance sheet back up to make itself for any other opportunity might present itself at some point in the future how were looking at MA and how debt of role book Capital for all color Do you have a followup Capital guess if could can you much along the same idea on the balance sheet and how you at cash return might have missed it did you happen to give out the share price at which you bought back share this would you moderate given the share price pullback we saw how we should about share count Lets see we bought back worth of share this total of share so an average price of about would point out over the last since the end of beginning we reduced our total share count by the average price of those share we bought over believe were about give or take we to buy back share a we talked about in the when the intrinsic value we believe higher than what the market value is then it make to buyback on a steady if you dollar across averaging of what done for many year and what u do here recently fact the recent pullback in price is allowing u to buyback a few more share with the same number of dollar of a round the world at share repurchase if you answer your on you well go to the next please Following we have Will with you for squeezing me in hoping you can quantify a comment you made earlier about the portion of sale on millimeter and could increase over could you a bit about where number is now and where youd see over the next of year Will were to try to hold back and it is proportionally more than it each go by is proportionally more but well hold at a while longer till we can get a more comprehensive and better understanding for everybody on how to about do it again the highest it’s a fairly straightforward competition lower dye cost which mean about lower total total IC cost a we get proportionally more revenue on there incrementally benefit our margin on our cash flow a we go in is something Ive become aware of and talking to investor the last of quarter is underappreciated and whats on the portfolio itself helpful Appreciate it a my followup another comment made earlier about the relative strength of versus the embedded this and there a comment about end market the end market mix helping am wondering if you could quantify help u understand of the better is very diversified relative to embedded but maybe about if they were maybe some end market were a bit more challenging effectively embedded a bit more if you at embedded it have a high exposure to three different market communication equipment industrial and automotive and you our a much broader exposure including exposure to personal electronics obviously good exposure to industrial and automotive a well but it those type of difference explain performance If you at embedded processing and you back at the growth rate between the two business youll note often time they grow at different rate if you over eight embedded processing been growing yearoveryear the growth rate for both of those business are essentially exactly the same so of work out way over a longer of you Will and well go to the next please next come from good afternoon and is on sort of the general environment is obviously a seasonally down anyway it hard to get a read on whats on a we sort of or a you to your customer and we compare now let versus month would you classify the forecast in the environment a a better weaker or about the same Tory guess it about the same wouldnt classify it is better or weaker it about the same in again we have had the same leadtimes for several year and customer are ordering consistent with generally speaking get some of expert from timetotime because theyve underordered or have a surprise on their but true a and it true we continue to see customer manage their inventory of our product a they have early a mentioned earlier and the distribution channel were at alltime low a week of inventory same last and this very low a customer standpoint we see them again ordering leadtime and consistent ordering pattern so tell u they are order they are keeping their inventory very low overall characterize it a relatively the same of customer demeanor a what we saw a very helpful followup if have one your annual growth yearoveryear is the goal internally to continue to grow the every or there anything unusual here the last month kept growth rate so high would internally we have very aggressive goal to grow the business and describe a we want to outgrow the market significantly in so we have all the unit are focused up on do at the performance of the product line every and we at a threeyear compounded annual growth rate and stack up against all the other business both of a well a competitor externally and how we measure it again a Ive earlier a we believe would represent some share gain but it would be real cautious to at anyone and draw the conclusion or try to dice out what percentage of growth would be from share gain you Tory and we’ll operator for one more sir we have with you for taking my guess it a point of clarification on the OpEx outlook for down is all restructuring and then there gravy on top of in term of seasonal saving or is include the seasonal saving the here to do is take a at there a seasonal decrease top of be another a the last rest of the EP restructuring is completed helpful then guess hoping you could about inventory downstream relatively healthy on your book but would love to hear what your thought are in term of in particular at the disty inventory from a day standpoint have unchanged at what would describe historically low level a over four and a half week Again number is low because of the consignment program we have put in place Beyond our distributor and into our customer we do have a good percentage of our revenue on consignment overall and in fact if you combine what we shipped through distribution a well a what we ship to OEMs on consignment represents about or about half of our revenue where we actually there is no inventory sitting in front of u and manufacturing line for those inventory we inventory number and it is zero we have very good visibility into portion and we do have a balance of the of the classic Ill describe it a book ship type where they give u an order and go on to a backlog and we ship it at leadtime and there we havent any report of large inventory pocket from customer were through and racking up this quarter result and we see what happens on front but were not aware of any big pocket are downstream well you very much for your you all for joining u and a of this call be on our Ladies and gentleman this today appreciate everyones',\n",
       "       'you well now take the from with go ahead good afternoon on the strong result guess my is on OpEx for the into you of guided OpEx would be flattish QonQ and you did better than of is a pullin of the of annualized saving you expected from the restructuring or is a bigger number than how do we about OpEx trending in in the back half of the right the OpEx we had expected to be roughly even from and the and came in a bit lower than we had expected part of some pullin with the restructuring action we announced in the for both embedded processing and resizing of our operation in Japan and part of it continued discipline on the part of all the unit in when it came to spending you into we continue to expect the half to be the primary benefit of the cost saving we talked about for those restructuring action Recall ph we expect about of annualized saving with about of in OpEx and the balance in cost of revenue a we go into well see about half of amount in to our result in OpEx with the balance in by the we leave the we should be at an annualized cost saving from action have a followup helpful a followup this is somewhat of an unfair but if you at the proceeds from equity compensation Last it almost about a of the cash return to investor been a volatile number and a number impossible to predict of how should you we should about number from here do we try to model number in the future we talked in during the update to our capital management strategy we would expect the proceeds from stock option exercise to reduce considerably saw gosh it two to three time our normal rate stock option exercise and cash proceeds in than wed in prior year wed talked about would back down to a more normalized would suspect you what we saw last what we saw this is more reflective of what you should model figure about you we saw about or of stock option exercised last and thatll drop back down to of you please you go next to with so much for taking the appreciate it could you give u some perspective on of the broader cyclical environment Would you there anything at all on other than normal and maybe break down by subcategory a bit Ill leave a both question and pas from there you we have any unique insight into whats on from a cyclical standpoint the we delivered you we feel good about If you at the middle of our into if excluding legacy wireless is another good on a yearonyear If you at a lot of the signal one would pay attention to such a inventory of the channel we took several day out of inventory in the a we had a higher percentage of revenue supported by our consignment program of distribution if you at cancellation they continue to remain at very very low level inventory at customer remains in check a well and then if you at our lead time they continue to remain stable always have some pocket where they may move out temporarily with our capacity and the position of our inventory we feel good to be able to continue to support you have a followup sub the vertical any difference by vertical from a yearonyear standpoint we had if you at industrial we had growth in nearly all the sector so very broadbased from standpoint led by area factory automation Automotive we had doubledigit growth and all of our sector led by ADAS or Advanced Driver Systems Personal electronics down but it would have been up had it not been for legacy wireless enterprise system we saw growth driven by projector and server coms equipment up due to wireless infrastructure broadbased growth on stand go to the next you take with for taking my question want to dig in to your guess your margin trajectory incremental operating margin for and embedded processing both exceeded in the also about incremental operating margin over guess the strong performance particularly in surprise me a bit thought most of the cut you did were in embedded processing wonder if you could give u some sort of view on whats driving strong incremental margin how much of is sort of margin expansion within the business versus OpEx what do you sort of see a sort of sustainable level of incremental operating margin a the revenue in the business continue to grow the fallthrough very good both on a quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear certainly at the and at the level mentioned guess on the call from from an OpEx standpoint spending remains disciplined across the while the restructuring action you referred to disproportionately benefit embedded processing versus other area of the some of also some of restructuring benefit other area of the a well example we mentioned resizing our sale team in Japan not the sale team in support of embedded processing but also those in support of some of the other unit you get a bit of benefit there then you disciplined spending across the a frankly people are spending only what they need to support the growth of the a goforward again we expect OpEx to be down a bit primarily for the benefit of embedded processing Thatll be true for both the and Beyond if give you any more forecast on OpEx other than by the we reach the end of the we enter next with OpEx about total cost saving from the restructuring about about of coming off OpEx Got it helpful my followon want to dig in to margin a bit if take you half of the of hitting you or hitting you by next it sound to me guiding OpEx down about which would give me an implied margin guidance at the corporate call it into the upper so you up maybe point maybe a more off from can you give u some view of whats driving margin expansion Is this further efficiency manufacturing efficiency is this depreciation coming down Is this something also to do with mix or pricing or overall revenue leverage a revenue grow it a bit of all of to be quite frank if you take a at a we go on margin you there multiple driver the portfolio not the least of which is being able to load or fill up our very costeffective factory also get improved product mix especially a we see industrial and automotive becoming a larger portion of our total revenue mix finally we get the benefit from depreciation a it begin to roll off being the CapEx is running substantially below depreciation now for quite some Again to the depreciation about of revenue over the last month and CapEx is expected to around you we get some closure start happening over the next of year Depreciation this is expected to be down a bit versus last but itll start to climb more rapidly next you a number of different thing on not next move margin up again a you indicated but should also continue to benefit u a we out into the balance of the and into you we can go to the next please you go to with next good afternoon for taking my Wondering what utilization in the and where you expect to go then the part of my a you into typically seasonally softer thing seem fairly normal wondering your thought on seasonality into Ill mention Ill to utilization and to seasonality there you we at utilization to we expect to change all much a we you have our wafer start not too far off from what we saw in the and what we excuse me the and what we saw in the out of the factory in the overall utilization unlikely to change all much a we into the near from a seasonality standpoint essentially were to you determine what you believe seasonality is a few thing to consider a you go through obviously calculator revenue is usually strongest in and with the backtoschool buying and you saw in our result this our semiconductor growth is typically relatively stronger in the and quarter compared with the and outside of we put much credence on a sequential growth number because the number around have been so unpredictable and were to step back from trying to provide any appearance of doing on it because itll appear were endorsing one number over another so have a followon wondering maybe in the a similar whether outside of calculator there any area of particular strength or weakness had mentioned com had been a strong point Is sustaining then it seems auto a well have held in there better usually seasonally weaker half but seems strong comment there yeah Other than the topline ph guidance we get into strength or weakness by If there something very unusual on with our legacy wireless of course given visibility into those type of thing in the with well move to the next you move to with Capital Capital for taking my before begin my it been great working with you and best of luck in retirement before forgetting to into the number if you could a bit maybe about your strategy to maybe increase cash flow we at sort of whats on with your balance sheet getting close to getting a debt might be good to carry debt and stop retiring it or maybe start rolling it you maybe a bit about your strategy there the strategy is le about debt and more about the actual product portfolio and the market were after about being were thoughtful on how we spend our research and development dollar and we spend them on product we expect to have very long revenue life stream off of them then in correlation with is to continue to be opportunistic and to expand our manufacturing capacity at time when you may least expect u to do because we can get it for cost are very low Those are our two biggest lever for expanding cash flow it relates to debt a you observed we paid off in debt of this raised in the and repaid in the so a net reduction of still have on the balance sheet total debt of about and those actually have life extend all the way out to see balance vanishing from debt vanishing from our balance sheet anytime soon a goforward of course our buyback one of the thing you were asking about on the cash flow is a function of what our calculation of net present value of the is so long a we see the intrinsic value of the exceeds the market value well continue to be buyer of the stock Capital you have a followup Capital What role MA possibly play and when do you is there an opportunity to reenter the MA market have not been active since the National Semi deal closed when it come to MA again it about product strategy bias is likely to be to find an opportunity would be attractive to u bias would be in the space a opposed to embedded processing frankly aside from the technology we acquire and the product opportunity we acquire being attractive meaning long revenue stream it would also have to work for u mathematically meaning the price at which we could acquire it would have to be such we could get a return on our invested capital of three to fouryear were disciplined about Some of the opportunity some have speculated on here in recent month are such if we do the math it very difficult to overcome hurdle of making it ROIs be accretive we very important if were to actually generate excess cash flow and cash flow off of any acquisition in the future you next please you take with you wonder if you could around the strength you alluded to in communication equipment in Is macro base station or is there some other element of majority of is would be macro base station If you at investment were making longer include small cell but we have measurable revenue on product at this point a part of the embedded restructuring you had done it sounded you were pulling back on some of the investing in category Does your trajectory at all or mean youll participate le in base station over if you at those investment and those product cycle they tend to have they tend to be very long in nature the area pulled back tend to be area we now believe are either mature or in the process of maturing and yet we continue to invest in area drive growth in the future a much a small cell a indicated before so you well go to the next please you move to with Capital you on CapEx capital intensity been fairly below the you had you would be What should we be modeling for the remainder of the more importantly what would cause it to move and check ph upwards you again for purpose of your model would assume about a of revenue of planning to get you close to the right answer over any one it to be off but it be for on a rough annual Anything might cause u to go above could possibly be if we had a sudden opportunity present itself we could add capacity at a significant cost saving wouldnt than artificially restrain u from taking advantage of very inexpensive manufacturing capacity which would benefit our future cash flow right now see on the horizon so again for your model use Capital my quick followup you mentioned consignment a a percent of sale changed What it gone back up remember it used to be in the mid before If you overall our consignment a a percent of revenue moved up a bit from about to about If you of our distribution channel so about of our revenue are go through distribution and about of those revenue are supported by consignment the part beginning to drive higher and our inventory owned by distributor lower and well go to the next please you take our next from Rolland with Capital Rolland Capital your extra capacity you at the bottom of the cycle may have been a bit of a burden but can be very valuable a the cycle heat up here do you were at the point in the cycle where you are benefiting from extra capacity either frontend or backend Do you some of your competitor might have a lack of capacity there might be switching to your product clearly had this strategy in place now for a number of year where were acquiring a inexpensively a we can manage to in advance of our need most recent example the acquisition of an assembly test operation in Chengdu China commented on in the call were now bringing online so certainly been a benefit to u to allow u to have very stable lead time on behalf of our customer and to be able to meet any shortterm spike or lead request customer had had broadly speaking across the industry it break ph u many people perhaps have chosen not to invest in a much capacity a they might have in the unclear to u what may mean at least from our standpoint for our customer they can have confidence we have ample capacity to meet their need and Ill add also you taken other action utilize capacity different point of demand so one done and you can see it on the balance sheet is in period of weaker demand well actually build finished good inventory a well a aging wafer to support future demand on lowvolume product so it may take minute minute to set up a piece of assembly test equipment and you may run only unit on part and it may take up a halfhour or an hour doesnt take much longer to build either you six month of demand or a full of demand or a yearandahalf of demand and put on the shelf when demand actually get stronger the capacity open and to support stronger demand we feel good to be able to support any demand environment we see in the future have a followon Rolland Capital other it above the Street also above seasonality Is calculator or is there something else there calculator seasonally strong in the and for the backtoschool selling season and then is typically weaker in the and a kid are already in school and have their calculator you Now well go to the next please you take the next from with of of for taking my good luck to both and to my what are underutilization charge running at right now at what of utilization can they go to zero they were about last down from the prior which about a bit of a theoretical a to you what revenue it would take to get to zero the mix of product flowing across the various manufacturing flow are to have a direct bearing on if we had much higher demand but it on a flow where we didnt have a lot of excess capacity it wouldnt help much on the underutilization our job on is to make all of our flow maintain open capacity Ill everybody again the underutilization we distract u an accounting adjustment affect nothing happens to cash flow are completely focused on cash flow a the way to return value to our shareholder Ill also mention charge is le than half of it is actual cash so or about half of it is noncash doesnt impact our cash flow by having open capacity Do you have a followup of guess mean open capacity you have is more source of keeping CapEx low and cash flow rather than being a big source of expanding margin maybe on to my on the demand environment can you give u a you mentioned endmarkets but what about the geography are there certain geos are better or worse than what you thought two month you me follow up on the last one to make a clarifying point a talked about there are certain factory you and some competitor some of the manufacturer in Taiwan run above capacity you when factory or flow run above or above the theoretical from utilization standpoint well continue to get a benefit and we still may have an underutilization charge all you have left is revenue growth small number an underutilization charge wanted to make clear from a regional standpoint over we saw Asia Europe and Japan were up it roughly even from a yearago standpoint with well get to the next you take our next from with good afternoon you for taking my guess once OpEx normalizes in calendar how should we about growth in OpEx relative to top line into and beyond a long way planning doing there for a semiconductor analyst from an OpEx standpoint it grow at least with the change in paying benefit youd expect on a yearoveryear so youd certainly start there then to the extent we see additional opportunity we may want to invest in from an RD standpoint or additional sale opportunity we may want to expand it may go a bit beyond typically to see last paying benefit increased average around maybe depending upon the average from around the world what use for planning helpful guess a a followup on the cycle look your guide for over is slowing a bit and would love to hear your thought on where we are here Will we rebuilding inventory downstream and now were normalizing and now attracting more with GDP andor you are there any sign of reacceleration in GDP or in demand in any point geographically or product life et cetera you on front we spend a lot of looking at the cycle and our strongest indicator demand of course is the view we get from order and the forecast we get from our consignment customer a theyll give u forecast forecast of course can change you we turned in a good growth on If you at the yearonyear growth without legacy wireless continues to be continues to be strong at the midpoint of the guidance yes so you what we believe all those indicator are showing u talked about before thing you were building demand in the channel or downstream it actually took inventory out of the channel a more of our distributor moved to consignment and a the product were on consignment actually grew faster than the other product we you for a over fourandahalf week of inventory in the channel we consider to be lean but be running in what is the more of a new normal those change in inventory downstream because of the consignment are to have le of an impact on our revenue a what theyve had in the with we can go to the next please you move to with you very much you give u some idea of how your policy of returning the bulk of your cash to shareholder affect future acquisition policy Do you have expectation your acquisition activity be relatively low or youll be working primarily in stock purchase the way to about it it relates it of go back a bit to a asked earlier about believe by on debt on the balance sheet from an acquisition standpoint again well at the strategic bit make it make and then to make the number actually work on the return on the invested capital we put into it Beyond the way wed pay for it is very similar to what we did this last when we bought National Semiconductor we used some cash on hand but we actually released the strength of the balance sheet and went out to the bond market and issued quite a bit of debt which supported acquisition we slowly retire debt a we had been and continue to over the next foreseeable future open the balance sheet back up and make it again to take on debt if there an attractive ROIC accretive acquisition out there where would how would about the strategy see any of our cash management strategy having any interference whatsoever with our ability to continue to acquire when it make you take our next from with Suntrust Suntrust for taking my and congratulation on the good and guide hoping you might comment on the margin progression in the embedded seems to progressed a bit better and it look to u a though perhaps the restructuring benefit targeting are coming in a bit earlier than you previously expected Youre exactly right on They have started to in a bit earlier than we planned but we still have a long way to go see additional benefit a we move in the and a we talked about excuse me and quarter a we talked about earlier a we see more of the cost begin to out of there frankly while certainly helpful in moving the profit performance of it is not to be done when over with Theres a lot more work to be done there and work is on the revenue growth side operating profit clearly is below what we the potential for is and management team is very focused on driving result to get profit up to where it should be after the restructuring action are complete by the end of this it to be all about revenue growth actually been a lot about revenue growth a evidenced by the fact successfully grown for seven quarter in a row on a yearoveryear and we expect to see more of a we go can grow it way into cost structure indiscernible Suntrust helpful If can follow up a bit in there one area of where of underhitting relative to your weight in the industry and microcontrollers invested in this area in the last or two wondering if you can about you the strategy in term of product endmarkets feature might lead to accelerating share gain in category maybe Ill make a comment and if youd to add in a you an area we decided to step up investment back several year now back in the expansion of investment included both development team to produce more product and begin to broaden the portfolio is in application support basically supporting customer and designins we feel good about the progress have several year we have gained share of microcontrollers we still some industry analyst have u at a number six position of the market plenty of room to go those are the type of market take a while to begin to get traction and somewhat a flywheel you keep investing keep making progress and progress begin to snowball a product standpoint were building out a broad portfolio focused on catalog product primarily into industrial application Youll note of embedded processing we also have connectivity product there we support about a dozen different wireless standard were getting very good traction and you can go to our and be able to find reference design with microcontrollers ranging from up to a of dollar using all of those different combination of the connectivity product we feel good about the progress in the opening remark embedded processing had seven quarter of yearonyear growth and a big part of is driven from microcontrollers you very much Will can go to the next please you move to with my question also want to pas on the congrats to and to on the promotion Best of luck to both of you guess one clarification for wanted to get from you if could What the starting point off of which in saving exiting this to be achieved we announced action with our result and we took excuse me the and result a recall our we took the charge and for embedded processing the start there the we took the charge for the Japan restructuring it a bit of a mixed start if you itd be a hard to do a direct correlation but again the math you should be using is annualized saving by the we end the with of it coming out of OpEx guess a my followup in the and don’t if you are to do this anymore now started to split out the revenue in a different way but in the in the middle of the you would what the revenue by endmarket did midyear Is something you can give u now were planning on getting those number on an annualized a answered Jims earlier you well provide revenue on a quarterly a color on whats happened in each of the market what decided to move to with we can move to our next please you next come from with you and best wish in your retirement you talked a lot about strength being broadbased but there any segment of market in are relatively weak you whether seasonal or even secular ph an endmarket standpoint the only market we saw a decline in personal electronics and sorry it or guidance sorry again somewhat addressed were not trying to get into the color by endmarket or our product segment or realty focus on the topline number overall Did you have a followon fair followup is did you have a change in your distribution strategy at all in the or are you planning it thinking you are you to go to certain customer more of a direct or havent had any change in the cant we had change to our arrangement with distributor you on a periodic over the year for example if we go back a few year a an example we implemented the consignment program with distribution now more than half of our overall revenue supported by distribution theyre to continue to be a very important part of our focused on growing our revenue overall which mean growing our revenue with them invested in catalog product and in industrial market we want to work with the distributor to be able to broaden our reach with customer we do thing optimize both our resource and theirs but any specific of detail on with change we wont get into we’ll go to the next please you to take our next from with you looking at the endmarket breakdown one more apologize this been asked several time gave u the yearonyear trend you also about sequential trend from to yeah aside from the increase in calculator communication and personal electronics actually grew the most and we did see a benefit in personal electronics led by a strong in and notebook did see industrial enterprise system and automotive all contribute to the growth if you underneath and industrial a an example we had over a dozen sector of industrial with we saw area factory automation control smart grid motor drive ph drive automotive on a sequential we had growth in all sector overall and led by ADAS those are the thing drove the revenue in the great you then on the connectivity fund ph you mentioned you participate in a number of different standard if recall correctly you sold the smartphone a while back is is there anything preventing you from participating in the wearable market if you about the watch et cetera fact you youll actually wear some of those product to track my step and it quite a bit of contact ph both from power management standpoint and other product a well a connectivity the beauty of having a catalog portfolio is the incremental cost to engage a customer the tool and the support are all in place we can very readily and very easily support market overall go to the next please the next come from with Partners Partners a clarification on being opportunistic in acquisition of manufacturing asset Are you is it for taking a long view on increasing capacity or are you removing bottleneck in the manufacturing flow look Richardson and there still a lot of headroom here it can be a bit of both If we see bottleneck popping up some place and were able to go ahead and pick up equipment inexpensively or if we anticipate a flow is to become a bigger more important revenue source in the future we can go ahead and pick up for outright new factory for example and whats what we did when we bought the assembly test site in Chengdu China an entire we had bought in case well play well take advantage whatever opportunity present itself especially if the finance are compelling Partners this commentary on connectivity growing faster within embedded assuming you were talking about internet of thing and wearable socket ph could attach with microcontrollers and power management and do you have a of IOT ph mix how much of it is more industrial military responder type of application with long cycle if you at our the product portfolio we actually support a dozen or so different wireless technology so whether you need Bluetooth flow energy or WiFi GPS we have multiple sub gigahertz standard including thing ZigBee whatever label you want to put on to essentially if thing are getting smarter and more connected a broad of catalog product in which to show the customer and we can be fairly agnostic on how to solve their problem and bring the best bit of the technology to whatever market theyre trying to enter oftentimes well find manufacturer have you never had any wireless experience so theyll want to go to the web theyll want to contact our local apps people and get support for product and they have to become RF expert so they can focus their on other thing a combination working real well we can go to the next please the next come from with you wonder if could go back to some of your earlier comment with regard to the consignment revenue guess to clarify guess what saying is the higher percentage of fulfillment through consignment expecting for is whats pulling down the booktobill in the talked about your booktobill for the nonconsignment portion of your you tell u what is and perhaps a better indicator of the endmarket booking trend on the what talked about had a conversion of more product into consignment to distribution so suppressed the booktobill a bit we came out of the with If you keep in mind oh gosh how much of our revenue is through consignment now Probably for the total is through consignment What mean is booktobill for consignment revenue is by definition one so the booktobill we reported at the applies to the other half of the revenue we reported in very simple term be because it applies to nonconsignment portion of the again suppressed somewhat a a result of a conversion from a previously directly sale to a consigned arrangement add in you we delivered a sequential growth and our booktobill if you at order they were up you booktobill number is one number and a it some noise in it it one consideration we at a we put together the demand forecast have a followon my followon guess Ill ask a bit of a bigger picture over the year always been a cyclical the function of the industry a you are operating the a bit differently now your focus is on some different endmarkets interested in your view of you what do to the cyclicality of a we go over the next of year spoton you at the mix of whats on our portfolio in year a you observed we had some big vertical certain endmarkets you might be able to take a at and our cycle with endmarket in addition to any socalled semiconductor cycle itself Now a we have industrial and automotive becoming a larger and larger percentage of our total revenue and the market to which our product are being shipped into arguably we would see likely see le impact a a result of big vertical fluctuation and begin to see a bit more correlation between growth and the global GDP a a whole well track more to the economy a opposed to a particular single endmarket not to we escaped the semicycle if there still is one simply to our fortune are more tied much more broadly than they have been ever in the and therefore theyre much more reflective of you how the overall global GDP tend to expand over with operator we have for one last you final come from with so much based on your current schedule of depreciation and if you assume CapEx remains at roughly of sale when is depreciation to hit the of CapEx Is this is a event or is this sometime beyond it unlikely we would see CapEx and depreciation converge prior to a good starting point for you to build your model with have a followon great great then a about margin dropthrough the number been a bit above the last of quarter is still the right number to about for the margin dropthrough people were talking about operating margin dropthrough but wondering about margin dropthrough certainly were operating at a higher now than we have in year we talked a number of year about a longterm a long window of fallthrough during the course of a cycle historically been a good indicator to follow in any one it always been it doesnt apply very well More importantly well operate into much higher of than we have ever in the and would expect to continue to drop through quite richly and importantly drop through a cash flow we can continue to return to our shareholder in the form of dividend and stock buyback great with turn it over to to make some final remark we wrap this up me close by saying the year working at been a good great ride and me simply pas on the request and word of advice had been passed down from generation of manager and please screw it up you all for joining u of the call is on our today presentation you for your',\n",
       "       'and we go to with afternoon for me open the questioning on the strong result helpful on giving u topline and bottom line guiding for the of a we about margin and OpEx how the OpEx saving of linearly fold into the model between now and on the margin line should we about sort of historical incremental margin against revenue growth me start with the OpEx you into the next in particular recall in the to step back for a moment an annual we typically have our pay and benefit increase occurring in the typically two of the three month of the incur increase clearly a we go into we’ll have a full three month of increase to the point you were bringing up on some of the saving we’ll see from the restructuring in Embedded Processing action we’ll see a bit of saving begin to materialize in the OpEx be fairly flat majority of saving occur in the half of the to everyone else we’re expecting about in annualized saving a a result of announced restructuring the profit it’s exactly a you should be thinking over the course of the cycle our fall through average is about on the way up and on the way down that’s a good long model to be using a you build your model Follow on maybe you can help me out a bit the reclassification of revenue you did of curio how a mix influence margin if you about the new bucket of revenue where do you expect to see faster longer growth versus slower longer growth either by design or by market force when you about our reclassification of revenue are you talking about by end market or are you talking by By end market specifically you Even though end market me of all address more by product line the biggest mix change been a we’ve gotten out of legacy wireless even though that’s essentially zero a of you’ll still see the impact on the yearonyear comparison through the course of in general the legacy wireless margin were lower than corporate average getting out of those product area beneficial to margin and end marker stand point the way to about it is margin tend to be highest and this is not unique to you can across a broader of company but margin tend to be highest where volume tend to be lowest Meaning where maybe the better way to it is where the revenue is most diversified across customer and application area so for example industrial can see other company are highly focused on industrial and we see it in our own result where you’re selling catalogue product into lot and lot of different customer and different application within the industrial space and tends to be at nice margin Other area automotive where there are a lot of special requirement from the standpoint of quality the design end cycle tend to be long product life cycle both in automotive and in industrial tend to be long and tends to be beneficial for margin also They tend to be lowest in the short cycle high volume end market area and that’s partly the nature of the competitiveness of those opportunity combined with you don’t have in term of the life cycle of the product to engineer in cost reduction to get margin where you would to see them over so there’s lot of example of and again you see it in our own result and you would see it more broadly with other company if you where you would expect to see highest growth over would make a of observation both industrial and automotive from an application area from their embracement of electronics technology they’re at a tipping point where those very likely be the fastest growing semiconductor market by nature of the provision of semiconductor technology those application Now would also we have a good position in those market and we believe analogue and embedded are important we also believe frankly our sale force and the breadth sale force is an important competitive advantage for in reaching especially in the industrial market a broad base of customer there not surprisingly and you’ve heard u for some now they are priority area for in term of investment and in term of our expected penetration into those market and application doesn’t necessarily mean their revenue grow faster a a percentage of TI’s total because you never what happen in a particular high volume market over you would expect our position in those market get stronger and over the percent of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive continue to grow a well for the question and let’s move to the next we move next to with Jeffrey’s for taking my apologize if asking you to repeat what you’ve read in your script but could you walk through the mechanic of the capital return for this have the debt you’re to pay down but you issued some understand the cash flow plus the proceeds from the option minus the debt service is what you expect to return if you have do we subtract or do we also factor in the in debt you issued this a part of pay down me try to get to the way you’re trying to ask Again at the high repeat what you there cash return strategy is to return of the cash flow le any amount used for net debt retirement plus proceeds we get from stock option exercise During this or during this month there virtually no net debt retirement it the proceeds from cash flow plus the stock option exercise virtually all we returned all of to the shareholder in the last month of to the shareholder you move into we do have of debt that’s coming due on we’ll go ahead and pay off so when you rerun math you’ll see some usage over month of cash for debt retirement mathematically say the percentage we return by the we get to the end of be in excess of in excess of that’s timing and a you go through the course of the net itself a we move on through the me ask a clarification in a where you pay down debt immediately right out of repurchase or is it a more smoothing type of application in term of the way you at the return formula a more smoothing type of application not affect the timing of our repurchase continue to do repurchase a you’ve u in the which is a very steady hand constant hand a we go through we don’t try to our repurchase try to be very steady and methodical about it Do you have a follow up did and for asking clarification appreciate trying to model the cash flow through the normally you have have account payable and account receivable are a big use of cash which they were this and then in account receivable becomes a nice source of cash Is it fair to assume typical pattern is what we would expect to see is there any other working capital shift might happen this that’s different than what you’ve historically had you you’ve identified quite well Typically our and quarter are our lowest for cash flow and operating cash flow and flow cash generation we had pay and benefit increase a mentioned earlier also pay out our profit share and our performance bonus during the Then the we of course have estimated tax payment we have to make for the us some cash but a we travel through the our operating cash and our cash flow have a tendency to increase to to to and then decline again don’t see anything in would suggest would be any different than what we’ve for a number of year now you for your Let’s move to the next move to with Capital Congrats on the strong result and for me ask a If could could you dig into a bit what you’re seeing in term of the mix of product whether it be ASPs unit and then a bit of insight into maybe your back log what you’re seeing in lead time booktobill and maybe the projected turn you need to meet the midpoint can maybe give you a bit on term of ASPs excuse me not aware there’s been any significant shift one way or the other again tends to shift take place on ASPs when you have differentiated product such a we do tend to be more driven by mix than they would general pricing environment you might or a competitive pricing environment Again no substantial shift there other than when you over on the longer impact of moving out of legacy wireless Lead time are generally stable any point in you always have some mixed difference might cause lead time to move in or out for one product area versus another generally lead time are stable and for what mean is the majority of our product are shipping with lead time of le than six week comment on backlog you asked about came into last with a booktobill of and we’ve into this with a booktobill of clearly we’ve a bit more visibility than we had last or even the before to put in perspective order in the we mentioned earlier we are up about over work out to being up about over with those combined element from a backlog standpoint lead to expect we have reasonable growth in total revenue a we go in a indicated by the guidance we’ve included with this release I’ve this before but me you with the booktobill about of our revenue is supported by consignment and JIT program so for revenue booktobill is always the is a blend of only the revenue that’s nonJIT or nonconsignment which is of our revenue if round and call half of our revenue the booktobill on those product would be shipping on traditional backlog and order entry type process would be more a the total being a because then get blended with the JIT consignment product at a booktobill Hopefully helped and didn’t further confuse Did you have a follow on Capital excellent color do appreciate it follow on is about sort of the cost of running the you have executed your restructuring plan to lower some of the cost but how should about the cost in OpEx in relation to revenue growth If revenue growth continues at double pace the core OpEx grow with same double pace or is there some leverage there we do have some leverage certainly in and is the restructuring we announced in beta processing and Japan mostly kick in during the half again to you that’s of annualized saving we expect to capture by the end of the a we roll into next we’ll see it on an annual spread roughly in RD in SGA and the balance of in cost of revenue and cost of good sold we’re of spread way Beyond again we’ve commented a of time on prior call our basic model for OpEx is to operate between and of revenue it not go up or down necessarily at the same pace revenue go up or down be more of a steady change over but some of these one off anomaly described with the restructuring on in a beta processing and Japan you Let’s move to the next move to with you give u your thought on the relative growth rate of your analogue versus embedded versus your guess your other category this then maybe about the various put and take of why embedded up so much analogue up a bit le and the other down so much this are you asking for comment on looking or of why the historical result were what they were Both be great If had to choose one I’d but both would be great Forward be short discussion because we have can legacy wireless continue down through the rest of this when compared against the it’s zero already the reality is it’ll be what it’ll be You’ll see certain time when grows faster than Embedded You’ll see period where Embedded grows faster than even in his opening remark mentioned it back in where we stepped up investment in Embedded because we believed there a great growth opportunity for and microcontrollers have answered question from you for a long about where’s the growth go along with stepped up investment frankly we’re starting to see it now make because it take of all for RD to translate to product and then for product to get designed into customer and them to get their product to the market what we’re seeing now in Embedded very specifically in the micro controller area to do with the stepped up investment we made a few year in microcontrollers Certainly also what’s helping Embedded is we mentioned from an end market standpoint we’re seeing strength in communication equipment a well clearly the DSP position our processor position we have in Embedded across much all of the various OEM’S ship into wireless base station market are benefiting now in term of market starting to lift for u term of the same You’ll see over period where power grows faster fact would be a trend you’d if you over an extended of meaning five year or so power consistently led growth in we that’s an opportunity continue in the year ahead to do with the world wanting to get greener in term of power efficiency and it to do with a lot more product in the end market becoming battery power and that’s a great power management opportunity for leadership in market mean a market lift we tend to lift more than most other player Outside of what we’re doing in Silicon Valley what we’re doing in high performance both those area in the industrial market are very clear beneficiary of the industrial market continuing to lift stop there Those are some general comment again we don’t try to mention it have certain area industrial and automotive are important to u but frankly much every product area whether it’s application product or processor or catalogue device can reach into industrial and can reach into automotive and be beneficiary of strategy Do you have a follow on and hopped on a late sorry if you already talked about it can you go over what utilization rate were during the what you’re expecting them to be this then given all the restructuring and fad et cetera maybe refresh u on what your sort of peak revenue is and where you would need to start adding equipment in term of a utilization on utilization again we haven’t disclosed the actual percentage utilization in quite some tend to do when it’s a dramatic change it’s informative our factory utilization from a stats higher in the than it in the but the average wafer moved through the factory about the same in both quarter consequently the underutilization charge the same in both quarter both and at about the outlook we have for the with the guidance we’ve offered clearly we have been and we’ll continue to increase the loading in the factory to support the increased expected outlook revenue growth in the then to the last part of your there the installed capacity we have is equipped to the point to support we believe about of revenue we go we’ll continue to for opportunity to increase capacity at the lowest possible cost a we have done for a number of year now so we can remain focused on maximizing continuous cash flow over a opposed to trying to maximize factory utilization level over you Let’s move to the next move next to with Are you there why don’t we move on and if come back in maybe we can bring him back up move next to with jumping on here a bit late but noticed the guidance for EPS growth is significantly higher than revenue growth is capacity utilization you’re not to give u margin guidance but is utilization the biggest factor driving the fast earnings growth presume you’re talking in relation to the sequential growth when you’re asking in relation to you’re to see certainly you get some EPS growth off the revenue growth itself see some improvement on utilization mentioned a moment we’re increasing the loading in the factory you’ll also see a similar improvement a you go to the next on lower manufacturing cost Recall a of year we had announced we were closing two older six inch factory one in Houston and one in Hiji Japan and those basically are behind u now so cost saving is finding it way through you’ve a moving part on there Do you have a follow on and can you a about the impact of OpEx on EPS during the a well you believe addressed earlier and he basically OpEx should be relatively flat instead of repeating we’ll move on to the next please move to with for me ask a a of quarter there a lot of about seasonality and what to be and you chose a three average for your sequentials in the we is still a good a boggy a any for the from a sequential perspective by my math yield about up You’re guiding above better than seasonal in what you are seeing two month after we gave you number in we then started to decline to provide it again the reality is seasonality the number you up with for call it an average growth for any particularly vary so widely based upon the you used to collect so we’ve decided is instead of u giving you our view we’ve historically provided call it a three or five average five whatever reality is when we threw number out it being perceived a an endorsement of of growth for and never our intention what we’ve decided to do is you go through analysis and provide your own estimate on seasonality If you need help with the math on whether it’s a three or a five average could help on but not to do it for you other is and I’ve noted even looking at report coming into this current report sellside analyst saw had anywhere from call it average for sequential to up to again reinforces the is so wide from our perspective internally we don’t put much emphasis on seasonal average given how wide is If you it’s important then we’re to you go through on your own Do you have a follow on be a more successful with this one Embedded Processing seemed the provided the upside in the you reported you about the microcontroller area starting to deliver growth given the prior investment you’ve made can you give u a bit of color on some of the application are driving growth why did they start taking off finally now maybe looking what’s the road map from an end market perspective and application Anything can give u a color in helping u to channel check would be helpful I’d offer a of thing Microcontrollers the beauty of microcontrollers is they tend not to they are so so diversified across application so good luck on channel check but they’re very much so in industrial application Certainly automotive is a factor there other piece would mention for embedded processing already mentioned communication equipment Base station clearly a lift for only would caution against is the view would draw some significant upside because the reality is for most part analogue and embedded processing came in about a expected in fact our revenue overall we’re or so above the midpoint of our guidance again the generally came in about a we expected what drove the strength there would be a mix of industrial automotive microcontroller application a well a communication equipment much everything broadly up in the guess your follow up you and we’ll move to the next move to with Capital can you hear me now can hear you now Capital Perfect sorry about apologize also if you mentioned this earlier but on the outlook for outside of calculator were there any outlier in term of product either up or down in your outlook we don’t specifically break our forecast out into particular end market or product area what would be safe in saying is it’s a broad based traction is taking place in and it’s driving growth doesn’t mean everything is up uniformly the same but it is we believe the strength be broad based for u a you pointed out calculator is the one outlier where it tends to have a good back to school strength in the and we do expect a well this Do you have a follow on Capital term of your restructuring effort you’ve talked about wondering if you’ve taken any other action now there are product line Particularly microcontrollers seems an area of investment Have you of reallocated any resource there or any color on if there is any other segment you’ve paired back on spending last when we discussed the restructuring effort we were taking we included the discussion of embedded processing in Japan Japan is clearly one is underway be complete for the most part by the end of the or at the end of to resize our presence in Japan principally from a support standpoint to be more commensurate with the size of the market opportunity there it relates to embedded processing we did discus we were in some case reducing investment or discontinuing on some area were no longer showing growth opportunity and other case reallocating affected our processor side a well a our microcontroller side to a lesser degree in Embedded Processing Beyond those there’s no other action we’ve taken or intend to take we’d discus right now for your question glad you were able to circle back in and let’s move to the next move to with you about from a big picture perspective can you don’t if you tried to out how much of your revenue is directly related to internet of thing can you try to give u some of the percentage of the revenue that’s related to IOT what with a in a large semiconductor actually creating a is independent Boy we don’t and frankly we saw in all the hype the realm the internet of thing if you at our capability and market position it is to none If you across processor microcontrollers are inherent in connecting the world Combine with our connectivity capability whether WiFi Bluetooth ZigBee those type of capability we have in our embedded a well potential to then go pursue opportunity of connecting lot of different thing is to none being a soon a the world go and put a big label on it and try to calculate how much everybody and this and that’s not what we are interested in love the diversity of what you are calling internet of thing meaning if lot of different application they have different requirement they are across different customer the idea of somehow circling it up into a common end market or whatever we is the wrong approach because there’s not much in common there from a technology standpoint or from a customer or an end market standpoint again we’ll try to stay away from the hype keep our head down and go attack opportunity Do you have a follow on and did actually yeah Sorry actually jumped on late but you might have already talked about this but can you address the channel inventory either your inventory and also inventory in the channel and also maybe u of what normal seasonal is for did hit on some of those thing channel inventory for we described a le than five and a half week unchanged from where it’s been for some now would if you more broadly we inventory we would characterize a lean would characterize customer inventory a lean one of the best data point is cancellation from customer are incredibly low right now and we reflects a combination of lean inventory a well a the growing demand environment we are in both the other piece there we did address already for your question move to the next please move to with for taking the appreciate it to ask one with no follow ups since a lot of good question have been asked had broken out a you usually do your segment at the beginning of the in term of end market exposure it consumer Kind of a longer is a number you are comfortable with or is a number you’d to see decline over through market share growth in segment consumer don’t is growing a fast on a revenue a some of the other market over because of pricing pressure and such there a perspective on where you would to see number three year from now a lot and that’s a good me do a of thing also give a bit of the color of what happened in by end market because nobody asked very clearly we do about the one end market being personal electronics and in of our revenue is not what you would historically or typically of a consumer though have product gaming product in there television in there set top box but it also includes mobile phone notebook computer printer and also thing tablet so it go down between and largely because of our exit from legacy wireless most of revenue would have been shipping into the personal electronics space again don’t and I’ve had a number of question from analyst over the last few month imply a people of personal electronics a consumer not again mobile phone notebook and space a well They do tend to be consumer buying decision a opposed to enterprise but they are not what you’ve typically thought of in a consumer electronic in the remark we gave a top overview of what drove revenue from a can give a more granularity on we talked about communication equipment being the highest contributor of growth from a very clearly tied to wireless infrastructure we industrial Interestingly industrial if you go out to our we break down into multiple sector something different sector below the industrial Pretty much all of them were up in yearonyear comparison with most of them up at a double growth so good strength and broad strength in industrial Automotive similarly If you go at the sector on our all of them were up Infotainment product were the strongest but all of the sector automotive were up Enterprise Systems we were about even for and is a combination of growth in projector revenue which again is primarily DLP for offset by decline in server and then the last area which we started off with on personal electronics down but it down much only due to legacy wireless If you would have excluded the legacy wireless revenue out of comparison then personal electronics would have been about even from a again that’s a more color of what happened there you for your question and let’s move to the next move to with Banc of Banc of you for taking my at your half growth in and Embedded it’s almost yearonyear strong well above what we’ve from most of the peer group so far Are you worried at all about double ordering anything suggests trend could sail off in the half Do you have enough visibility in the half whether it be roughly seasonal Not anything suggests the trend are sustainable versus not make up a comment and if you have anything to add certainly jump in we’re not seeing at this point sign of of overheated market Typically come along with crazy expedites and thing frankly we didn’t see in the saw customer giving u good visibility into their need We’ve been shipping at the lead time we’ve been quoting them and our lead time have been stable environment typically there’s no need for customer to start double ordering process you mentioned again we see no sign of taking place term of visibility in the half again we’ve customer for the most part trying to give u visibility into their need would not we have would not want to try to provide any comment about half visibility at this point do you have any other comment Not much different than what you’re saying would looking over the number here go back to your point did have over growth in the when you combine and Embedded processing That’s up a bit from last when it yearoveryear and up a bit from the prior when it up to yearoveryear What we’re actually seeing is a slight acceleration in to it look the low teen that’s consistent with what we talked about at the last earnings release we felt shaping up to be a better than this is reinforcing the big difference we see is in it appears in the economy is attempting to grow at a faster pace than it in the last few year for the in a number of year you’re seeing Europe beginning to grow rather than shrink continue to see growth broadly across Asia albeit at a slightly lower rate still growing quite strongly what we’re seeing here is the result of an improving broader economy and our effort of trying to gain market share those space combined our result and the nice growth for a for the half we’ll give you forecast at least the part of forecast in about day maybe the other would add real quick is you see our inventory number have good healthy inventory not getting drawn down again customer were worried about supply from you would see some impact on those type metric and yet we don’t right now Do you have a follow on to Banc of for answering are the largest player in this space That’s encouraging to see the of trend you’re reporting my follow up more a math but at what revenue would underutilization charge be behind you asked in a different way if you’re saying you have installed capacity of and your current sale are about don’t we continue to see underutilization charge until you use all of your installed capacity how should we about underutilization charge number you report every in relation to the amount of installed capacity you have and then obviously the implication on how we should model your margin would suggest you about it the way we do and the way most of our investor we speak with seem to about it and is not what is the underutilization capacity of the current profit margin or next profit margin but what’s the total cash flow we can generate with capacity and what’s the cheapest way to bring capacity in house so we can maximize cash flow that’s exactly how we about it frankly we do no focus on trying to figure out how to get the utilization charge down to zero fact by definition with our stated strategy of buying capacity opportunistically when we don’t need it when price are relatively low by definition mean we always have open capacity and therefore we’ll always be underutilized in a classic from a cash flow standpoint when we do the math and the trade off on and the last few year are certainly proving out we generate a heck of a lot more cash flow with of behavior than we would if we focused purely on maximizing utilization which put u at the risk of buying capacity at two expensive of a price that’s the way we at it I’d offer you maybe about it on the longer view a opposed to trying to model in near GPM percent swing and utilization swing you for your question Let’s move to the next move to with for taking my apologize if this been covered hopped on a late but when looking at your guidance for next and backing into sort of the implication for margin getting something that’s reasonably close to almost point increase you’d mentioned higher revenue you’d also talked about the six inch fab closure understanding the fab closure were already in the number Is this something happens a a lump improvement this or any color you can give u on guess the relative impact of driver revenue cost saving and mix would be very helpful guess some indication of whether number is something you are actually are thinking for next on the margin clearly they are to be up and they are to be up quite a bit and it’s not dissimilar to what you saw a If you go to a and take a you would have our margin from to increased in a similar manner in part that’s a natural effect of stepping up manufacturing production for a typically stronger versus one if you take a on a over the best way to about it is we continue to have improved product mix we still had wireless Now we have virtually none it’s mostly and embedded processing have lower manufacturing cost versus a and again this is the Houston and Hiji factory now completely out of the mix to a lesser extent we have some lower utilization charge because in fact we are expecting revenue level this this to be higher than they were a so take on a bit more of our capacity there’s a combination of thing on there the bottom line is when you do the math your margin are to be stepping up rather nicely a you suggested Got it guess to follow up on same trend Presumably you’ll continue to have higher revenue over than you had last you are sitting now would it’s close to point higher than you were last Does this mean you could actually maybe even have visibility into the ballpark of exiting the and into Is something you don’t if you internally about margin target anymore but that’s something is this something could actually be plausible at this point Stacey would a lot of number are plausible don’t spend thinking or looking at it in context spend again more thinking in context of are we taking step are to maximize our cash flow on a continuous in doing then GPM tends to fall out from standpoint there’s nothing structural stop u from getting higher GPMs a we move fact if we continue to be successful a we have been in increasing our and embedded processing mix at the same of keeping very low cost manufacturing underneath mix then clearly our margin not only are benefiting a you are computing now but continue to benefit a we into the future for your question and operator we have for one final move to with Eric Rasmus it’s Eric Rasmus calling in for appreciate you getting me in here a lot been talked about the restructuring but maybe can you about the progress on the Embedded Processing in boosting those operating margin there last looked some out performance and the margin were up is there a target you’re shooting for internally Is there something you can maybe tell u for your end and maybe help u measure the progress there Eric the way to about the Embedded Processing is again we’ve been seeing some nice growth in if recall six quarter of over growth on in we’re beginning to see the payoff of prior investment resulting in real revenue growth growth is in the right area where we can we’ve sustainable product revenue stream and very attractive margin Consequently we’re seeing profit margin beginning to improve rather nicely and that’s even before we see the benefit of the restructuring action we talked about for Embedded Processing That’s not to we’re done There’s still quite a bit more work to be done but most importantly with is focusing on is growing into it inherent cost base so more growth is what’s to be important there clearly at it current operating profit level it’s not anywhere near where we it can take u to won’t go beyond on forecasting what margin might be but you from how we operate the here we’re focused on cash flow which mean you’ve to have some right margin in there this still quite a bit of work to do to get to where we expect entitlement is Do you have a follow on Eric Eric Erasmus great for CapEx maybe Where do you see your investment being focused do you plan on allocating your CapEx guess over the next month you Eric we did announce with the earnings released we had acquired an assembly test site in Chengdu China be spending money on in bringing building up to our standard and bringing the production line up and ready for output in the half or late this the majority of our CapEx tend to go toward our assembly and test operation given we already have significant capacity in our wafer fab operation great Eric for your question and we’re to wrap it at this point you for joining u of this call is on our concludes our you for your',\n",
       "       'take our from of guess could you help me understand when you about these realignment action how big of a revenue pie did these cost of cover and what sort of the growth hurdle or the margin hurdle you used to try to determine this sort of realignment of cost can get into all of detail clearly the embedded processing overall run last about of our revenue processor piece of communicated can update it even for of our revenue last again where would most of the action in embedded processing are taking place again it primarily in processor would secondarily were taking some action of microcontrollers a well processor about half the revenue of course not all of processor been affected but certain product line within then separately the action in Japan last Japan about of our total revenue again this is more or le an action to one hand well be consolidating some of the activity previously in Japan to other region of the world where we can do it more efficiently then also well be effecting some of the sale and marketing activity in Japan of to align those resource with opportunity we see in Japan do you have a followon relative to the new segmentation with personal electronics being of should be an area where we see future realignment or do you feel given your cost structure you can still go after the growth in market Is sort of acceptable return do about over a a percent of the mix would if you take a at on the youll see it’s down a bit yearoveryear and whats on there is the wind down of the legacy wireless the handset and the tablet space is coming down continue to be engaged in personal electronics make no mistake about it biggest difference is well be driving a lot more aggressively with our catalog product a opposed to custom product on the historical the catalog product tend to have a much longer life to them and a much better margin profile to them than custom product do there wont be any overt change to our approach to personal electronics wind down on it own because of the wind down in legacy wireless the biggest driver of we go next to of Capital Capital you take a or give u some insight into how far all of your acquisition have been integrated What talking about now on your restructuring front it sound end market related Are there more efficiency to be gained through further synergy you might identify we havent made an acquisition in a of year of any meaningful size and much wound up the if you the synergistic opportunity of consolidation about a now there not much in the way of synergy a it relates to acquisition What were doing on this restructuring is part of an ongoing exercise actually done for a long Theyre usually of a smaller in this case a bit larger looking at where were spending our research dollar and looking at the market opportunity those product from research spend would go into this case some of the market have matured or about to mature which mean we need to have a many team designing new part for it or in other case we may have invested in certain market where we had anticipated better growth and return opportunity those initial expectation have since been changed for a variety of reason there no acquisition synergy can of to suggest to you is an ongoing process of dealing with the reality of market change over Do you have followon Capital followup been some concern in the industry a far a unit growth and the ability to grow revenue sort of above global GDP level saw some interesting data out of the recently showing some steep decline in ASPs you comment if seeing any change in the way either you or your competitor are approaching the about competitor can at we have not reset our exception downward a you might be suggesting there from a growth standpoint over the last few year global GDP been certainly below normalized run rate and certainly affected our industry a well our view is the market we serve being and embedded processing likely grow on a unit frankly from a revenue about global GDP we believe for some Again were looking at longer trend not what happened over the last three year or even five year Again our view on is unchanged go next to of a on the restructuring how much of the cost saving go into COGS versus OpEx and what do you is to be the revenue headwind by the end of the in term of taking these product out on the cost saving again we anticipate by the end of the well be at about annualized cost saving a we exit the About of be an RD about in SGA and about in cost of revenue it relates to revenue there should be no impact on revenue not eliminating product were not discontinuing product These are product have very long life What were dealing with here is the rate of change in those market have matured now in most case and it no longer make to continue to invest or invest a heavily a we have because there not growth window there many of these market we view are maturing frankly you could double you could triple the investment and not affect the revenue not affect the growth rate because the nature of what the market trend overall is doing again me reiterate in the remark but it there are no product being discontinued and were not exiting any market with this action Do you have a followon you maybe give u of the status update on your end market and what you expect to grow maybe the most personally ph the least for this can do a part of which is the historical view we want to try to extrapolate into a forecast for me start with and again this information is coming out of the database grabbed put together for our new market framing again most end market were down biggest driver of our revenue decline though a seasonal decline in calculator a we before half of the sequential dollar decline in the Outside of personal electronics declined the most followed by enterprise system and industrial and all three of those area declined at singledigit percentage rate Automotive and communication equipment were each about even a more color on some of those area Industrial we saw strength in appliance and industrial display but strength offset more than offset actually by broadbased decline elsewhere enterprise system we saw weakness or decline there due to server in personal electronics we saw decline in TVs gaming and printer and we saw strength in tablet Moving to the full industrial for this is based for our revenue up driven by factory automation building automation appliance medical and motor drive Automotive up for in the driven by infotainment system a well a advanced driver assist system and safety Personal electronics revenue down due to mobile phone and tablet a we wound down our legacy wireless followed by much smaller decline in other area of personal electronics Communications infrastructure for the up driven by both wireless infrastructure and enterprise switching Enterprise system for the down driven by server and projector and then calculator declined for the we go next to of Capital apologize if you answered this already decline in embedded you had expected decline in processor Is greater than you were expecting and what is your trajectory this for me of all get some data in front of me saw and it are you talking about the sequential trend in there Capital Sequential decline into the it down doubledigits so to be honest have the data here on our forecast cant again reiterate it down doubledigits a connectivity Microcontrollers down also but to a much lesser degree but have the forecast data on processor to be able to what it did versus our expectation Do you have a followon Capital someone asked this already looking at the do you see any of your segment growing if so which one and would you point out any segment are outside of calculator are down a significant amount Again calculator be typically flattish in the to transition their typical seasonal pattern anyway only area we we expect an additional decline is in legacy wireless where it go from in the to be essentially gone in the we described already Outside of those two area we have comment in term of end market trend we expect to evidence in we go next to Chin of Chin is on your automotive Based off of the strong growth you mentioned for last wondering if you’d any color from downstream customer on inventory level and supply chain and especially given the comment from AutoNation last week about relatively high automotive inventory in the any comment on momentum there in the half of the Steve don’t have anything more we would have from a would be a unique perspective provides you have somebody AutoNation talking about inventory of automobile you have data we have any unique perspective several layer below where were selling into supply chain Ill speak more broadly we believe inventory seems to be well managed currently if not lean heard my comment on distribution Distribution inventory remain below week which again are lean anything in term of a particular supply chain automotive we have granularity again our general is inventory is not at all an issue more broadly into the market were serving Do you have a followon Chin followup is on margin and sort of relative to where your inventory level are currently If not mistaken in prior quarter you were able to build a bit of strategic inventory some of your longer shelf life product given where the inventory level are currently would it be safe to you would not continue to build any more strategic inventory on the inventory we closed the at about day of inventory which is consistent with the model we have for ourselves of carrying between day and day specifically if you at our balance sheet youll notice during the we drained our workinprocess and our finished good increased somewhat reloading the factory to meet the lowered outlook we had in the do expect in the to begin to reload the factory a we go Inside day is the strategic inventory you were talking about which is our product have long shelf life and been building up for a of year now well continue to manage at about these current level we go next to of can you given the saving on the OpEx can you a bit about how OpEx is to work it way through the Is there sort of anything out of the ordinary other than how the get ratably impact the PL through the me go ahead and comment on for to remember about OpEx is itll seasonally go up in If you over the last three or four year and compute an average you can see on average about to you can expect an increase again in this a we start out we flow through the the cost saving we talked about a a result of the restructuring action begin to show up in the half of the and by the we leave the well have well be at about annualized saving rate at breakout mentioned earlier across RD SGA and cost of revenue do you have a followon do yes if at analog share been talking about SVA gaining share this if you take seasonal for the it look your share in basically flat in versus is there something maybe might start to kickin in is to cause to gain share yearoveryear well see how our roll out guess for starter based on the WSTS data been released through we believe we actually gained a small amount of share in by the way should note if we over the last few year guess have data since in front of me average gained share at point to point on average per gained in every one of those year the been broad mean there were some year where we may be Ill point of gain and other year during where gained over point would it not necessarily a smooth curve in term of market share gain but at least it consistent from the standpoint of what we believe gained share every it our expectation and our intention to continue doing including By the way everything there could also apply to embedded processing Although would also embedded processing in our share stepped up a more strongly in embedded processing than it did in last again market share is important to u Everything Ive also described about our market share gain on an organic so it not comprehending acquisition and the impact of National anything but again been gaining share consistently and we expect to continue guess your follow on we go to of Recognizing it a relatively small part of the are you managing the yearoveryear decline in server a if a secular issue driven by server virtualization some of the other company have also highlighted uniqueness in area do you more of a cyclical issue in the sever market Do you expect to bounce back in area Ill comment on cant specifically were managing server by itself are looking at the entire compute space notably hard disk drive for example noting whats been on in total demand for hard disk drive and managing accordingly to what look to be a secular decline a you pointed out in space so been adjusting our investment level in technology development and our staffing level and so on to meet what we believe a a smaller market than what in recent year term of the MA outlook youd mentioned you havent done a deal in a of year and obviously you have been so good about doing these deal over the year and then you have integrated and potentially over looked at others If you do not do a deal in the next of year do you it would be because you find one for sale make or do you not incremental deal make regardless of whether theyre from here it more the not the latter is when we take a at potential acquisition we real hard at the number and to be able to make of the number Namely we’ve to be able to get a return on investment exceeds our weighted average cost of capital in a reasonable timeframe which we define a three year to four year if we cant get the number then we simply step aside and wait for an opportunity to at a later date a number driven analysis a we at MA we go next to of of Capital MarketsUS on the divergence and every both the business not track around the same level embedded down a lot more on a QoverQ versus What driving it very similar to what you it the market embedded sell into this case we noted the processor area down more than other area to have different customer to have different market but theyre both very diverse business but theyre not uniformly consistent in term of the customer the market theyre selling into Beyond we have a color for you yet Capital MarketsUS Going back to the comment you made earlier on at the top of the call you mentioned feeling a more and want to paraphrase the word but the message feeling better about than you did heading into Is to do with the new rationalized product portfolio or is a comment based on what seeing from the end market it both to be honest Ill make some comment then some thing a to how he feeling a well of all the strength and position of where we are in and embedded is a big factor Having those two product line now making up of our revenue out of the in the frankly is a great feeling and position u you a well a any how long the winddown of wireless revenue Having winddown behind u such the top line growth of the can reflect lot of the good thing were doing a lot of the potential and embedded have embedded in them is great also more specifically the overall environment in term of the market were selling those product into and frankly area of strategic focus such a industrial is important to u Automotive is important to u strength of those market and frankly our position in those market not our position is so strong it saturated we the fact we have lot of headroom for growth and market share gain we also the design position we have there then maybe a more tactically coming out of our booktobill strong exiting the than it a and we also have good backlog coverage coming into the a well those are the kind of thing we at do you have anything else you would add on a macro looking at the total economy the economy clearly seems to be stepping up it growth Europe appears to have stopped declining and it appears China stabilized and those are three big economic region of the world you’ve to feel better about at this stage starting than we did month starting with the uncertainty were all staring at in those three economy then again a bit more tactically to what talking If you back a the sum of and embedded processing of it and embedded processing were down quarteroverquarter on revenue in and flat yearoveryear Fast to this and not only is and embedded processing bigger in percent and it also bigger in dollar term it only down quarteroverquarter and is up yearoveryear real momentum a we move into you take the macro you take a a the portfolio is finishing it restructuring and you to feel good about how were to start and what the might hope for u take our next from of had a capital management last unusual and you came from stock option exercise obviously you have a crystal ball on this could you give u a rough a we into what we can expect a far a cash flow generation especially maybe handicapping the year stock option exercise do wish had a crystal ball to help out with particular but you lacking on right now would we would expect the exercise are to be lower next than they were this would also put aside any concern about because frankly we use the cash proceeds from those exercise to buy back share it doesnt impact what been able to do to share count for our stockholder believe in early were to have a mentioned were to have a capital management strategy update and be a good to ask some of these question Ill take you a deeper into some of what were thinking on on where were with capital management at Also do you have any CapEx and RD estimate for the in the sometimes at least given the RD guidance for the wondering if you can do again this but not to be getting from u anymore CapEx guidance we’ll give you simply is a band we about around our revenue meaning our target is to of revenue on any one we expect given the size of our manufacturing footprint we expect to be pushing above the lower end of the other word more around of of revenue until we hit about of revenue from a CapEx guidance how suggest you youll hear the modeling from u and not a number on RD frankly were reaching a point now where it stable and it should of grow with paying ph benefit increase over and with the top line revenue growth over based upon were not to be providing RD guidance Youll be able to take a at our result and itll be straightforward for you to model the other one would comment on is also historically given annual guidance for depreciation again given depreciation is so gapped these day from CapEx and frankly it a multiyear lagging indicator versus our CapEx trend it doesnt seem to u to be an especially useful number and from a guidance standpoint and clearly you can go up and make some assumption of what may be given what our capital spending trend have been take our next from of of of both my question are about different end market on the wireless infrastructure market if you could give u a for whether some of the restructuring doing on the processor side Does impact the ability to benefit from all these LTE deployment or am feeding too much into then there isnt any connection in case what are the trend you are seeing in market would of all we believe anything we are doing here is to impact our ability to benefit from LTE deployment again a lot of those and not mean the base station area is not an area where were seeing some resource reduction it is in general LTE we are already very well positioned across those various customer our systemonachip product have been out in the market for some so we have a great position a LTE continues to deploy to the comment me maybe more broadly and Ill start at the embedded processing and then drill down into some of your comp infrastructure me again you heard u give the number but embedded processing delivered strong growth this came out of area catalog microcontrollers specifically product line the the came out of area connectivity processor for automotive market processor for industrial market those area have been driving and producing growth we continue to invest a aggressively a we have in the reduction were making are a before primarily processor and then secondarily in some of the product area in MCU within processor would identify area IP camera and certain area of communication infrastructure or frankly the future growth doesnt merit our current level of investment Now to specifically of your about LTE and base station more broadly guess want to go into a lot of specific there except to again comms infrastructure is an area receive fewer resource it based on our view part of the macro base station market are maturing the flip side small cell is an emerging opportunity for u and well continue to invest accordingly there even in the maturing area of base station a started off here we believe our revenue continue for a very long given the breadth of our position and the long life of the equipment were already engaged with there hopefully provides you some color a to what were doing in comms infrastructure Do you have a followon of actually had thought about asking you about the market instead what Ill ask you is in the market it always about what have you done for me lately last the story about the benefit you from exiting wireless the strong capital return now for this what were hearing is a sort of the same what is the next catalyst can help you either outflow the market or provide much superior return than what we are seeing from the peer group what is the value proposition for outsize invest for overweighting this there is a number of opportunity in front of u on here some strong growth rate we talked about in the area been focusing our attention on for a number of year now and embedded processing about the fact were returning of our cash flow that’s what we use for debt we also have a plenty of room to grow with very need to spend much more to grow and talking specifically about our manufacturing footprint If you take a at the very costeffective factory put into play over the last of year and the lowlevel of CapEx take for u now to keep those factory the incremental margin and cash flow opportunity from those factory is extremely attractive addition to the overall growing space in industrial and automotive which tend to be not only quite longlived revenue profile but also quite attractive margin profile Again those product run across those inexpensive factory and help generate ample amount of cash from an investor standpoint there are quite a few thing to continue to to which is our ability to continue to grow at the of rate were doing now the and embedded processing and leveraging the very inexpensive factory we put in place to generate a lot of cash me make a of other comment a lot of our longterm oriented investor clearly looked through the wireless transition frankly even over the last few year into what becoming and the value proposition for them a focused on very diverse market of and embedded processing didnt require a lot of capital generated a lot of cash and then a you pointed out they liked management commitment to return cash to them would of take a different view from what you described with some of the other investor because investor a lot of investor Ive talked to last the before the before the response give me a we what doing in wireless give me a call when out of it and no longer represents a headwind for your growth for investor have been sitting on the sideline because of the concern wireless represented such a significant headwind to growth the value proposition for them is clear no longer there and the growth been producing in and embedded is no longer to be an obstacle for top line growth and for a lot of those investor frankly our growth hasnt screened very well in the not to be an issue my two cent worth on topic we go next to of quick one What would you your new target are if theyve changed at all for the growth rate in embedded a well a your operating margin goal in embedded given the restructuring action would of all in term of growth rate target absolutely no change Again embedded did a good job on growth last Frankly we would have liked to have growth through at a higher of profitability overall for the but growth not been an issue to the extent tried to describe for you our investment in the area are growing in embedded continue unabated our expectation for a growth in embedded are absolutely unchanged youll continue to see good result there term of profitability and margin objective guess what would is provided some number in the in fact Ill what in the because you have them in your note there in investor meeting our manager there described his growth margin target were to operating margin target about What would is in general a wellrun focused on the embedded processing market opportunity we potential for a financial profile consistent with those type of number being what were to do with this is very similar to what done for and not the communicating margin and operating margin target and progress again clearly our objective are much higher than where ran last and ran Do you have a followon do cant get away with the whole call without somebody asking about the margin any help on the put and take for the a we at the margin seems to imply at the midpoint of everything it down a bit but want to double check on right wont give you guidance Ill give you some high thing to about a we came through the we were taking our factory start down through the we go in the were taking our factory start up and that’s on the expectation of a normally stronger for u result of is to be while start be higher in the than they were in the the average utilization wont change much based upon and the timing of moving the wafer through the factory and through the assembly test site we would see a bit of margin headwind a we bring those factory back up but not a large amount my clock show it is we are to wrap up at this point to you for joining u of this call is on our and good this today call you again for your and have a wonderful day',\n",
       "       'this well take the which be from with wondering if you could a bit about how you see sort of channel inventory now how comfortable you are at where the level are why you a bit about what were seeing in DSP in general hey expect resale from our distributor to decline about the same amount a our semiconductor revenue overall and we expect result in much change in inventory day of distributor Do you have a followon wondering if you have any color you can provide from on end market perspective are seeing some a bit stronger a le strong handset if something you can see in your guess what would is at least from our perspective we there not a lot of about by end market biggest consideration of course would be for calculator where we have a significant seasonal decline this following the backtoschool season in fact calculator make up a a reminder about of the sequential percentage point decline for overall were expecting at the middle of our current of diversity though by customer by end market our performance this and be le impacted by any customer or individual end market and more by the overall trend we experience in the economy and electronics market a well a by our own and performance of course guess this considering the number of semiconductor company have issued guidance for sequential decline this were seeing anything unique overall or by end market this well take a from with you a bit about your linearity of booking and how booktobill is trending so far have a comment on linearity but what would is order and backlog both have declined a we would typically expect for a a general observation but have the monthbymonth report for you Do have a followon you u what would be a typical in term of sequential growth or decline a to our expectation well wait until we report in to share our outlook regarding what would be typical or seasonal to you determine what you believe to be seasonal based on your own analysis of our historical data guess some general comment we would agree our calculator revenue a strong seasonal pattern through the course of the associated with backtoschool but wed also agree our semiconductor revenue growth is typically relatively stronger in the and quarter compared with the and Frankly though outside of we at put much credence into semiconductor sequential growth average a being reflective of any of predictable seasonal pattern because the around those average is so high and something talked about for a long now to avoid the appearance endorsing any particular number Ill leave the calculation and assessment to you there the next be from with of conceptually without giving guidance how are you thinking about the New Year if there a bit of contrast back ph with how thought about the trend when started Is there anything understand the mobile business is obviously very different other than is are there any put and take we should keep in mind a we start modeling next right would not specifically again Ill reiterate what before are our largest customer is now midsingle digit a a percent of our revenue are diverse across end market were sitting here viewing any end market or particular customer put and take a being particularly noteworthy a we into the in general a we at upcoming year we would describe were in a somewhat modest environment but not intended to be a positive or a negative statement in general we we have been and continue to be in a modest type of environment Do you have a followon Sort of part around cash have a debt payment coming up in wondering how youd about in relation to buyback activity the bigger is how long can you maintain cash return above your cash flow generation guess obviously we run a perpetual cash flow engine we cant run over forever although what last or actually in the last where over the last we had returned of cash flow reason we were able to sustain above cash flow even with paying off of debt over because we have an unusual amount of employee stock option exercise given the strength in the stock price over the with those stock option exercise basically the grant price the employee pay on the exercise of stock is an additional source of cash flow or additional source of cash rather for the we would describe a somewhat unusual over the last or so the consideration and depending specifically on what exercise do depend drive or determine rather what source of cash is the rest of your about debt Do you want to respond in general a we outlined in our capital management strategy debt would remain a permanent part of our balance sheet a long a the interest rate made they would be well wait till to make determination me also of reiterate what we have our expectation is for shareholder return and is basically all of cash flow minus what is required for debt repayment we expect to return to our shareholder our commitment take a from with you you have the exposure to end market given you guided to the midpoint of your former range is there any outlier either by end market product type geography any sort of color you can give Admittedly again at the average we a we noted guess would the is generally tracking consistently with our expectation and hold both at the a within a well a within various major product line and end market there is always some variation from those initial expectation but would there is nothing we would consider noteworthy again the is tracking even by major product line consistent with those expectation we communicated previously Do you have a followon Kind of a bigger picture one for your believe last in the date of the the pricing down about yearoveryear this the rolling quarter it down about People tend to of in the place the least pricesensitive you are the biggest player in the space have you noticed any change in the competitive dynamic would explain the ASPs heading the direction they are you want to take one in general we believe pricing any unusual decline and foremost point to if you at margin both in our a well a across the competitor theyre very healthy and it would seem to reflect a very stable pricing environment If anything lower ASPs in the database could possibly reflect a mix change from different type of product a an example if you at Integrated Products often have the higher ASPs than le integrated catalog product are often used in lower volume and in lower volume application if a market industrial us predominately those catalog device is relatively stronger than the other market it could blend ph down the overall ASPs Of course a a reminder for those might not those lower ASPs in catalog product translate to lower profit in fact those are often some of our highest profit product with the next is on behalf of wanted to ask on the microcontroller hoping you could give u an update on the competitive environment and maybe which vertical or product group you best positioned in for share gain in you want to take if you at our revenue of Embedded Processing heard u about the investment made in microcontrollers one of the attractiveness we about microcontrollers is they are used across all end market and especially in of industrial some of the recent growth were seeing is a result of the investment we made a a reminder we made those investment in RD expanding the number of design team we had producing microcontrollers and then followed up with increase in investment at within our field sale force to have application engineer with expertise to support microcontrollers would describe our investment is at and been at a we is necessary to drive and were continuing to expect to see growth in the future to support of investment Do you have a followup do your connectivity product into the embedded market how trended post the wireless restructuring last what are the biggest application for growth in have anything to about this in general done very well this thing want to get connected to the Internet and get smarter intelligence and connectivity is playing to the heart of what were doing with those product currently support over a dozen different wireless technology if you go to our youll be able to see design tip connect those plus different wireless technology to anything from a microcontroller sell for le than all the way up to a full apps processor we believe a great position of market and were seeing of revenue growth of would add something we noted even a or so the demand in the application were seeing when peeled the back and looked at it it is not at all concentrated in any particular application or customer a very wide of customer and application other would is a lot of time youd want to jump to Oh is it WiFi or is it Bluetooth or some of those more widely known standard lot of it is also what we call lowpower RF technology industrial standard for example ZigBee are an important part of our strategy there and are being embraced by a wide of customer next be from with had a on margin done a lot of structural thing over the last few year closed the fabs always had a big mix shift a the legacy wireless rolled away Most of these thing are done fabs are closed your now is mean wireless is almost gone about left Is there anything left structurally you can do on the margin front is this primarily now about revenue growth and utilization in order to get the margin above where theyve been recently no there are quite a few Ill call it knob we can turn on the margin front still and foremost which may not be fully appreciated and it often very difficult to describe it mean there a lot of what Ill call inefficiency cause margin if we improve we see benefit on the margin line Another one would throw out is it only recently shut down those inch factory which granted were not very highly loaded but we also have millimeter factory are fully loaded so a we shift more of our production into millimeter talked a lot of detail in the even compared to inch not even inch but inch or millimeter manufacturing at the silicon not inclusive of packaging and test there about cost saving when you go to millimeter a we continue to ramp those factory and a higher proportion of our manufacturing is done in millimeter we continue to see the benefit Another would point out would be talked about several time a we to how we can make stronger over the course of the next year even we see industrial and automotive playing the bigger role at meaning we would to have a higher proportion of our revenue coming from those end market general tends to be positive for margin a well those are a few thing Ive noted if you can of something else stand out again by no mean do we sit here back and saying done everything we can do Now well the well ride the utilization curve by the way utilization curve is to be very attractive for u because a talked about a lot we have Ill be compared our last to result from when revenue higher in and margin point or so le were operating at lower revenue Importantly utilization in point higher a utilization continues to expand be good for our margin plenty of open capacity and it to be very efficient capacity a because of the mix of millimeter Ill stop there and if you have a followup do actually want to follow up on same point given u some color for how we should about incremental margin from here you of talked about it over the cycle and the number given something around which sort of your average over the cycle If all of you is true and is to happen why shouldnt we be thinking about using a higher incremental margin to figure out the margin trajectory with revenue a much a anything what were trying to convey with incremental margin is and forgot the exact number of year basically over the last to year of cycle for incremental margin upcycle and downcycle is what averaged so what communicated is not a bad assumption to make Are there thing we could do to elevate it to make it even stronger absolutely Are there thing we could do to mess up on bet on one a well is of a historical number until we prove a different incremental margin is appropriate the best we could provide you a a guidance point move on to with Gabriel Ho is Gabriel Ho calling in for wanted to focus on the you give u more color on what you see by segment a we head into how should we about maybe your Silicon Valley versus your core Gabriel this is have any breakdown by end market for can nor any guidance for next by each of the business a pointed out before were we completed our of the acquisition of SVA and were actually very pleased with the performance again were about a ahead of the schedule from a share gain standpoint were happy with our performance doesnt mean all the work is done and there a lot of people working very hard to continue performance a we move into next in general wed to see all our business performing consistent performing consistently above end market or market growth overall what the wouldbe objective is what youll continue to see from u overall is a talked about our investment be pointed or any increase in investment be pointed towards the industrial and automotive market and where we see the opportunity true with the and it obviously true with a well Gabe do you have a followon Gabriel Ho on the wireless revenue do you expect and also maybe essentially a we head to correct what in we expected legacy wireless product to be about of revenue this and it should be close to amount basically we expect legacy wireless revenue only decline a relatively small amount this compared with last then we expect it would have a sharper decline in the at which point revenue be essentially gone this well hear from with Someone asked earlier about normal seasonality pattern in and appreciate to leave to u to analyze wondering if seeing anything either in the economy or in your backlog or booking rate would suggest a deviation from what might be typical Anything interesting from a of put and take perspective would lead u to thing are to be stronger or weaker than typical in the part of the again to reserve any comment we might make about for and inclusive of were to keep our comment focused on at this point Do you have a followon given you gave a bit of an outlook on the legacy wireless wondering if you can about what seeing in the comm infrastructure end market given whats on with the rollouts of or LTE in China and the potential rolling off of and investment commentary a to what seeing in market in general were well positioned with all of the comms infrastructure OEMs so where we benefit and we are seeing a benefit from any deployment are happening of China would it seems all the equipment provider are each planning to win all of of market were seeing growth at some customer while other customer are now through and readjusting inventory level theyve in either case in general Ill we expect this market to be a particularly big driver of our overall revenue and result one way or the other in the future move to Rolland with Rolland Capital some of our recent check with Asia of show a tail of month a bit of trepidation guess you would in and then a slightly seasonal pickup in betterthanseasonal pickup in did you sort of see pattern at all between those month even mildly we other than the comment made already we want to start to get into of monthbymonth linearity discussion Ill have to if anything we may be able to give you more color on in but not at this point Do you have a followon Rolland Capital stepping back bigger picture guess RD intensity at least a a percentage of revenue sort of decreased from high teen down to sort of low teen SGA sort of done the opposite or at least gone from lowteens to midteens are these trend in your model solely caused by the mix out of wireless here or there are some other thing play here how should we expect the mix between SGA and RD to sort of play out now wireless is closed what you observed is accurate including the cause would any adjustment in RD at over the is wholly attributable to what done on the wireless side or essentially in indiscernible Similarly SGA wireless not our operating expense in wireless very RD intensive if you about it dealing with a few very large customer SGA is to be lighter need to do a lot of marketing have to have a big sale force to call on a handful of known customer a we have exited the wireless it had a bigger impact on our RD than it on SGA those result especially once we report be much all in mix then youll see of operating expense is at a stable it can vary somewhat between RD and SGA always but and from quarterbyquarter but youll have a good view of the mix of this operating expense line with were to shut down we end the call me you a is on our you and good Again lady and gentleman this today call you all for your may now',\n",
       "       'question from the audience quiet this afternoon can continue of the dividend strategy a lot of semiconductor company have embarked upon been relatively always pleased by investor especially given for the tenure on this interesting is now it’s cool thought maybe yield start to go up significantly next If were to happen do you your cash return strategy would change at all would the us of cash change ie more buyback than dividend or quite frankly is there a point in when we’re actually doing acquisition with cash is better than giving it back to the shareholder do you about we try to lay out and it very conscious set of thought a we presented last formal overview of the capital management strategy of the reason we wrote down a we do believe something you can embrace for an extended by the way we’ve some credibility because what we’ve been doing for the five or six year look incredibly it is well so a we out a you about what we’ve designed in and embedded which carry with it a low capital demand manufacturing structure which then couple up with a tax strategy say you’re to generate significant cash get it back to where it can be used or returned Those thing all connect together you can’t do one part of those in term of how it work a we put together what we end up offering investor is a very unique generator and return of cash so the plan we’ve is we’ll continue down path with about of the cash flow towards dividend yeah view judgment about what mean it won’t be absolute precise with the calculator then the balance of would be used for buyback lessening debt and the caveat we put on one is old decision to be accretive or they’ve to be smart buyback we’ve shown good discipline over the now guess on eight nine year we’ve stayed consistent you saw u in the market even in of tough scary year those buyback have been very accretive want to be good steward of cash and invest it in a way that’s earning it cost to capital we’ll be doing would the risk here with is more duration than fundamental at a long enough timehorizon a an investor you’re to get paid no matter what price you get in on is not much of a fundamental risk least is they are harder to find go remain it’s not a but or even greater than it is China threat mean if you to me it’s becoming clear there is a mandate in China there is to be a China recovery we want it to be China made a much a possible Semis in general are insulated from at least in the near because either it’s entry not a lot of local supplier if you about the Chinese player they are nipping at the heel of the low end on the consumer side reached you’ve competed with for many year do you handicap threat not only in the next one to three year but maybe over the next three five or greater we spent and forget it a two year we spent quite a bit of through it plan we called out the plan and a a leadership team went down through what all the plan were what all the intention were you can get some good insight if you spend studying why the semiconductor industry or semiconductor company can go operate with wholly owned subsidiary in China because they don’t have alternative and why thing are different than other industry you can make of it on front Would they love to have a different outcome you to the answer correctly it yes we would they stated five year they stated in the plan and that’s been stated for a while other perspective add to is the Taiwanese semiconductor industry been trying to move in direction for a long year because can go back to the late personally and a lot of the company were starting up at to go to the word all even though it’s strong all continued to be very vertical very big volume most revenue per RD dollar working on the highend personal electronics smartphone tablet display whatever is we’re to see and we continue to see the same trend even in some of the aspiring Chinese company are trying to stretch out it’s hard to tell what’s the Taiwanese and a Chinese or an listed for matter we monitor them closely you’ve not watched any of them get to critical mass and respect Richtek but they’ve gone very vertical a you with those investment it’s the right for them to do because they don’t have a sale force they don’t have breadth of portfolio not if timehorizon the thing they’re to try to go invest to make up we watch it we have it on the list of thing a you can tell we pay attention to to date you haven’t the momentum go buy pull the audience one more for a quick upfront remember you buying the fab a S which is great how some of these your thought on sort of the fab list thought and how you’re strategizing thinking about adverse to peer many way it’s not a religious decision or a philosophical one it’s how can you do the best job when you’ve part type ship over unit a how do you bring the best service the lowest cost and the best continuity of supply to all your customer so when we sit back and at the manufacturing and technology it’s in some way a foundational capability to be a leader in and embedded it’s actually one if you at our very good traditional or microcontroller competitor they’ll struggle a the world go below or to where they’ll be putting more of their capacity on the outside so this actually be a fascinating asset get stronger over don’t see one of our competitor building a millimeter wafer fab any day soon because they could house multiple bumper of their one of those fabs they won’t have the scale to play quite the way we’re able to it’s one over you’ll see a continue to use it use it well it continue to emerge a a great competitive advantage we’ve ended our for spending this afternoon everyone for joining u everybody',\n",
       "       'Chin communication last or so it all sale close to midteens Chin given the big weight spending a lot of other communication company are waiting for right now wondering if you could a bit about what you saw in this most recent and the guidance for u what of product pitching to market Is it only DSPs or are there other high value product involved the last part of the we sell both DSPs and we have both signal chain a well a power and interface product timer clock and other thing so a broad base of product were shipping to market a well a ASIPs we ship all three of those category into market the nearterm well if Ill go back it to when ATT went to buy TMobile and put in their bid our revenue in dropped something it almost since then been six away from growth happening in market for three year the good news is actually begun to see some growth saw growth in we believe primarily driven by CapEx spend by carrier and then began to broaden in and in a with what spent from China operator believe me a good position in market wont make a significant difference to the financials one way or the other by how market performs but it one of those market the growth wont we have any good insight until whether it or not but when it well have the product ready to ship Chin from a competitive standpoint there are a lot of competitor in market are coming up with SoCtype design where in a lot of case there is a DSP element integrated into a multicore processor wondering if a trend start to affect your at all if not guess where are you able to continue holding on so you can grow your DSP If you at the most recent product category launched it a architecture called KeyStone and if you tear apart and at architecture youll see there are both ARM and DSP subsystem been of a well a host of hardware accelerator the great with the KeyStone architecture is it scaleable and it can do a full LTE plus all of the fallback necessary at the macro cell and you can run the same software all the way down to small cell so it give both our customer a well a operator confidence eliminates the issue of coexistence and thing others have had struggled with there had competitor have had integrated solution in the the market exists without competitor and there is alternate way to do solution we anticipate well standalone but we feel good about our position and Chin have a in the back indiscernible Ill repeat the for any of those who are listening it the center console opportunity in automotive What well do there a the product well supply are thing from the application processor part of our OMAP investment for refocused into area sell actually other controller embedded processor into space a well is of course a whole bunch of dragged along with a well a connectivity solution a the center console want to be connected to your phone and to other device content vary but Ill speak to it maybe a a more generally in a car and my understanding is there is about of semiconductor content on average in an automobile If you at a highend car may sell for around my understanding is there is about of content of when at car only of it content is to electronics a small percentage if you at how manufacturer are differentiating their product and their ability to differentiate it based on the electronics the cabin the and feel it high go to or move in direction most industry analyst believe it then the belief is market grow somewhere in the lowtomiddouble digit so to in an environment where the semiconductor market maybe growing to Does answer your Chin term of your capital return strategy the target you mentioned it at roughly half of the historic run rate for cash flow would be allocated towards the dividend Right Chin What of event or guess change in your overall financial model would we need to bump up for opportunity for the further maybe a more aggressive capital return strategy aggressive overall so it hard to go above or being above but when you at how you divide up investor value a dividend and some of would a allin own dividend a maybe suggesting a percentage go higher we also have our large number actually prefer to have share buyback there is good reason to both and we to listen to both and certainly we have a hard and fast rule always to be forever in the future we pick balance one the share buyback to see a consistency in the share buyback If you over the last year Ive talked about had more of a steady hand and reduced our share count by it been a meaningful reduction in share count and for those do it they view it a a very taxefficient way to return capital to them the dividend of speak for themselves so there is lot of advantage to the dividend a well Chin touching upon the MA strategy talking about or National Semi your last big deal Going can you about what type of strategy or what other target you might have in mind from an MA standpoint Ill start with the conclusion which is a large acquisition unlikely but Ill of backup and what type of thing we for and you about National it of fit follow this criterion is we want a product are centered up on the market having a high exposure to industrial and automotive they have a large number of catalog product have long life they have a diversity of customer they shift those product to Those product are differentiated and therefore generate nice margin Theyre able to manufacture among longlived asset so their CapEx remains low and they generate lot of cash and then we want to be significantly under valued so there is lot of company of fit maybe those criterion but last criterion is obviously a harder to match we from a financial perspective we at multiple metric but one metric we at is can we exceed our cost of capital in a three to four timeframe two year in the National acquisition were very confident were to be able to do you at our a lot these other property of fit criterion Theyre all wellrun enterprise They generate lot of cash flow Theyve strong balance sheet lot of them are run by either founder of near founder so there is no for forsale sign out front so the ability to step in and put a premium on top of you cant make the number work Chin one last for me a competition standpoint obviously there been a lot of growth happening in Asia and a lot of call it low cost manufacturer have spread it out a of time Chin Do you see them much at all in any of your segment also from a computing endmarket standpoint still a relatively healthy percentage of sale for Do you see any pressure from market because traditionally certain market have an indiscernible in margin structure and then some of your peer have migrated to other highervalue segment within Kind of wonder if you are seeing from a lowcost … …migrated to other higher value segment within Kind of wonder if seeing some lowcost call it Asiapeer standpoint you wouldnt to be in our industry and ignore whats on in Asia you do it at your own peril it is something we watch multiple company attempt to do to enter the market the most successful would be someone a ph Ridgetech there they find an endmarket perhaps is closer to home and theyll appoint a development team at a very function so well typically go up against them more directly in our high volume Theyve great designer and theyve developed great part have too Theyve low cost structure a low cost structure we can compete effectively against them What you see is competitor investing in a broader catalog of product of take five and year to get into those market havent any activity on front Chin to everyone for your attendance at the session and take care you',\n",
       "       'well go to with guess my relative to consumer bucket of computing gaming and handset can you give u a of how much represented of the overall in the and how much up versus the rest of the business the best can do is help you understand the weight of each of those segment have the growth broken out by each of those area for you me of go through real quickly the weighting of our end market exposure which can you then play with to make some assumption on Comps in total were and this is half data computing industrial consumer automotive and education again the reason we called out the area because in we called them out a especially weak in fact we also in our outlook for we expected they would recovery recover keep in mind the reason they were weak in the because customer in those area were depleting inventory ahead of the anticipated new product launch in half which we are now well into those new product launch were what driving were a factor in those area driving growth Again comms infrastructure already strong and growing in continues in a automotive and industrial strong continued a well into the Do you have a followon do is for on the incremental margin if you at both the and your incremental margin both quarter were over guess of to what extent the wireless declining Do about a type margin there then more importantly when the legacy when the wireless is down to how should about incremental margin from there the Ill answer the last part incremental margin from our analysis in the over the course of the cycle average about up and down any one it actually work out to number tends to be noisy in any one but over about and what we do for internal planning purpose it relates to the most recent right the fallthrough about it certainly a rich fallthrough part of mix but part of also improved factory utilization a we had higher revenue this than the prior so consequently we had a slight utilization benefit a well well go to with Capital from a high if you can about now we have you definitely showed increasing yearoveryear growth up and then accelerating although off of a easy compare the full growth seems more a few percent if you could about now we have a full picture for the do you there anything on in the bucket do you this is of representative of what the overall market is the is not done and right now there of a lot of point spread being made for our but we need to wait until we get into to understand what the final score is we feel confident when the final score are in well show market share gain once again for again we have to push through the but we believe a over the few year once again well be gaining share in for overall Do you have a followon Capital then if you can provide some color a to within the segment in which one seeing the if there any material difference between the subsegments looked Power up a bunch if have my number right in if you could about the growth driver there then where you see the biggest decline into in the case of Power Power had a strong also you used the earlier easy compare one more impacted by weakness so the inventory reduction and some of those vertical area in the in the it growth very broadbased but it also benefited from recovery in some of those vertical market and then would the same for HVAL if you at because those vertical market layered on growth to what already a reasonable base of industrial and automotive Power and HVAL both grew faster than the catalog space of HPA and SVA Yet if you go back to half of the and especially you saw more relative strength in SVA and HPA guess to put it all together theyre all pulling well in term of growth in thus far see where it take again where we go through some quarter had more strength out of SVA or HPA and other quarter a in more coming out of Power and HVAL you for your question well go to with Capital Capital can you give u an idea of what sort of we should be thinking for the other operating expense it seems to be moving around do you had the asset last x the asset sale still a reasonable bit of spending there can you give u some idea of what we should be budgeting for next in term of line on the income statement to try to make Ive what asking for OpEx overall for the our model is to run between and of revenue depending upon where were at in overall revenue demand most of spending is actually the and Embedded Processing it relatively small level of ongoing support spending the Other a bit of RD the Other for DLP technology other than small larger number youll see passing through the Other a we go be the continued amortization of intangible which run about a a we go through eventually decline into about a keep in mind stay there for year until finally wind down addition fall through where we tend to record any restructuring charge the restructuring charge we had this over and those also were recorded in the Other we into the expect youll see acquisition charge continue at about the youll see a final restructuring charge associated with the closure of our Hiji and Houston factory of about in the if you at the income statement for the all of the for the entire of comparison here over the last quarter all of the acquisition charge and restructuring other line are directly from Other with you can then if you want to extract out to see what RD and SGA trend have been in Other youll see both you wont see them independently the combination of RD and SGA gone down whether you at it yearoveryear or whether you at it again a large largely driven by the reduction in legacy wireless a noted right do you have a followon Capital my followon if we at the Embedded Processing growing nicely but not necessarily delivering the operating margin of the corporate average you about what doing a far a the operating margin leverage to a you may recall we spent a year significantly increasing our investment in particularly a it relates to microcontroller portion of particular taken spending up to a now doesnt need to increase anymore what unit focused on is the top line growth They get rather attractive margin off their off the part when they ship them about diversifying the revenue base and getting more overall top line growth to fall through to the bottom line what you saw quarteroverquarter top line growth came through rather nicely to the bottom line for your question well go to Chin with Chin one is on operating expense for the look you saw OpEx decline about versus the original guidance for down Wondering if there any timing or any or how you were able to do better than your original guidance and what the expectation process since OpEx we did guide to down about but were able to keep a tight handle on spend in the and so it came in a bit lower than we had originally planned which frankly dropped by to the bottom line and produced extra earnings per share for our shareholder we into the we typically have some seasonality in the what with the holiday for Thanksgiving and during the Christmas break so wed expect to see OpEx decline somewhere in the to a we move into the Do you have a followon Chin one on the Embedded Processing division particularly the microprocessor with the you mentioned wondering is the consumer or wireless an area where looking to be more aggressive on expanding the sale of your MC product the way to about it is the biggest driver of growth for microcontrollers be industrial These are catalog device go into lot and lot and lot of different application being were not if there growth in other end market or growth opportunity in other end market well certainly pursue them our expectation is industrial likely be the largest driver for the microcontrollers the processor side of the would we would expect comms infrastructure certainly is part of revenue and an important end market for u similarly we sell DSP product into lot of different application the broader application are to be a important maybe even more important than communication infrastructure not not anything negative about communication infrastructure it we have great market share very high market share already in communication infrastructure where there still a lot of opportunity in some of these other area for u to experience not only the rapid growth of end market but also rapid market share gain a well you for your one of the thing should further delineate is when talking about industrial likely being the fastest grower for microcontrollers me also more broadly include automotive in a well because is a great opportunity were very well positioned with those product there you well go to with RD spending a a percent of revenue is fairly low relative to some of your highvalue peer what lead you to believe you can maintain the growth gain market share and the mix do you there a possibility of poising ph your RD over me again everybody of the RD seeing for RD spend had in the been at a consistent versus the revenue of for quite a few year now the fact of the matter is the reality is RD spend is being converted fairly efficiently into revenue growth to the point where continues to outgrow it competitor and gain market share each would offer to you actually a very efficient organization when it come to our RD spend cant explain why some of their competitor have to spend a much a they do Similarly in Embedded Processing increased the spending over there a mentioned to the last over the last of year largely to expand the opportunity we can pursue in the microcontroller space so after bringing up of spending for a of year now it high enough at this point we now need to see it start converting into real revenue growth which were starting to see early sign of you at total RD it is coming down product sharply purely a function of u winding down the legacy wireless product including the announcement we had were closing some of our operation and site a it relates to and take our total RD spend down a we go on the core product of Embedded Processing and have no hesitation of being comfortable with the of RD spend we have in those area me also offer in the space would argue were spending more than any of our competitor Youre looking a a percent of revenue but if you at absolute dollar yes yes were bigger in term of revenue but were spending more than any competitor aware about in space it not were not investing in investing quite heavily right do you have a followon Certainly very useful part of your nonconsigned so distribution is your revenue guidance embedding shipment about in line with end demand any variance you can mention relative to end demand and sellin Oh we have a real breakout in term of the outlook between consigned versus nonconsigned looking at it in term of what we shipped in or what were shipping into channel specifically the answer to point if you back to anyway a a reference point we total revenue excluding the legacy wireless grew and our resale or sale out of the distribution channel grew you saw a very close alignment in the have any data to share with respect to other Ill even with we had a decline of a day of distribution inventory right you next well hear from with had one quick one on OpEx RD guide for the still put you about which would not which you OpEx be down and the midpoint of would imply RD down Are you rounding down to could you give u a more color on your expectation after the RD and the assumption around the OpEx we do round to the nearest hundred on all of these guidance number we give you be it RD or CapEx or any of the others in fact there be some rounding indiscernible there keep in mind also the OpEx guidance gave includes SGA a well we see decline in the on the seasonal pattern mentioned a moment with the holiday period on Do you have a followon do around again margin sound you a bit more restructuring left over from the inch fab closure in Have the benefit from those closure fully impacted margin in total it supposed to be about point if they havent fully impacted yet can you give u some feeling for the trajectory of impact on the margin What we talked about when we announced we were closing the those over inch factory is once each one of them closed wed see about per factory of cost saving on an annualized of those factory did close at the end of the and the other one should close here in the were beginning to see excuse me were beginning to see in the already partial benefit from and we should begin to see the benefit from factory closure materialize in the into next well begin to see of annualized cost saving a a result of closing those older factory you well go to with of one on the outlook wanted to make if there been any downshift or conservatism regarding outlook heading into the there an expectation looked macro trend are improving Industrial business are doing better is this comms infrastructure build the broader industrial player would be able to give aboveseasonal guidance it optimism since then we have sort of seasonal or slightly below seasonal outlook from Linear from Cypress and now also guiding somewhat below Street expectation my is there been any conservatism regarding outlook specifically what segment do you be at seasonal pattern versus below seasonal pattern for Ill go ahead and make some comment on and add some additional color the if you take a at our guidance the midpoint of our guidance is down about into forth About half of is the seasonal decline we normally get with the rolloff of the calculator the other half is much attributable to our underlying semiconductor If you take a at we actually believe quite seasonal and in fact quite consistent If you take a a mentioned in my remark the semi industry a a whole excluding memory in fact decline from in each of those year based upon the guidance were hearing from some of the other competitor ourselves included it look were stepping up for our of a of decline fact if you take a at and extract out the wireless revenue youll see our revenue have gone down in the of each of those same year similar to the industry in fact when you do the simple math during those last year for the industry it down about in fact were suggesting there some changed outlook or changed future fact would offer to you appears to be shaping up quite normally to u we take a at our order they were actually up about distribution inventory a mentioned were down about a day they remain quite lean with our distributor a well a our other customer cancellation remain very low and had no unusual request for backlog pushouts when we put all together suggests to u the is shaping up to be a normal demand environment similar to what for the last certainly the last year the other would add is even when we talked to you at the midquarter update somebody asked question about order trend and remember saying at point order quartertodate have been strong Booktobill above but we expected to slow a we approach the end of the basically a we for a of factor seasonality in general both calculator a well a semiconductor there a slowing through the end of the also we expected slowing would occur and it much happens almost every and certainly happened a pointed out each of the last year Do you have a followon a very helpful clarification a my followup wanted to make did you tax rate for be or for the full it would be then the real is on dividend and buyback you mentioned they have been at of cash flow over the last long can this stay at those should we expect them to turn back to whatever closer to the target you have outlined a a longerterm target the effective tax rate is what you should use for the the various thing occurring during the the entire be a bit different than for planning purpose use for the would you tax rate includes the RD tax credit which is set to expire at the end of this it unclear whether or not be renewed by congress in a timely fashion a we get into u provides about a benefit to our tax absent RD tax credit wed be closer to a tax rate a opposed to the were suggesting you use for it relates to buyback would mention again the reason it been a strong a it been the buyback and dividend at of our cash flow is a function of not only improving cash flow which we certainly have but also the benefit the receives when employee exercise their nonqual stock option given the increase in the in stock price this for our an increase in employee stock option exercise to give you a few number and summarize to of recharacterize what mentioned in my remark our cash flow for the last month Proceeds from employee stock option mean we had source of cash over the last month of used or returned to shareholder in the form of dividend and buyback Then we paid off debt earlier this of used a total of virtually used all we have generated this we do because one of the thing we mentioned our capital management strategy is we have a model for how much cash we carry to the extent we generate cash beyond model were quite comfortable with returning to shareholder a we have been doing to the ability of to continue to run at those high level a hard call would stock option do expire over and these are generally stock option grant are granted to employee quite a few of these option are quite old and they get used up would expect a we move into the future were apt to see le extra cash coming in from stock option exercise but it almost impossible to try to forecast the magnitude of change well go to Steve with hoping you could comment a bit on Silicon Valley here in term on where we are in your plan and if you have it this would it be possible maybe on the update to about what revenue is there so we can see where it relative to where you acquired it Steve would with the Silicon Valley off on the point of revenue we disclose revenue at the disclose revenue below so we wont be offering the actual revenue figure for SVA if were to about where are we at with respect to our expectation for SVA versus when we acquired National Semiconductor would the overall revenue are a bit lower than we had initially expected at this point in given the overall market environment been faced with this few year the rate of progress on share gain been quite a bit faster a mentioned during the last call those product line are actually gaining share about a faster than we expected addition had more cost synergy than we modeled into the acquisition had lower interest expense on very low cost been able to issue and had substantially substantial benefit from tax a a result of the acquisition when you put it all together the profit were achieving on the National Semiconductor portfolio is very close to what we have modeled at this point in so were reasonably satisfied with bottom line effect Steve even though we break out revenue quarterly can give you a of a rough breakout for the subsegments of for yeartodate so HVAL Power and then HPA and SVA are each about of total revenue again yeartodate Do you have a followon Steve if we could follow on in term of overall acquisition strategy in general If you at the microcontroller overall it still fairly fragmented out there also on the side you have talked a lot about gaining share and perhaps accelerating through acquisition Is there anything substantial you might do on either side there to change your position in any sort of substantial way at this point is it more organic growth from here Steve most of our growth for the foreseeable future is to be organic To the extent we do continue looking at acquisition given the valuation we presently see with many company out there might be an attractive addition to our portfolio it difficult for u to at what we might have to pay for some of those acquisition and actually get a reasonable return on the investment for our shareholder suggests to me to the extent we are doing acquisition theyre to be smaller tuckin one with reasonably good product line to fill in hole we have or talented engineer to help with our RD effort Theyre to be biased towards of the problem when you go into the microcontroller side you start getting different architecture into your family of product and can add complexity may not be easily leverageable not to we wouldnt there but these are the odds youd see our microcontroller are tuckin of acquisition Steve for your question well go to with guidance for EPS and revenue this it assume margin be flat to slightly down with the lower revenue margin keep rising inherently with the revenue decline were expecting in the well be reducing the loading in our factory a bit youd expect underutilization charge increase a bit and have a corresponding impact on margin declining a bit in the great a minor administrative you noted your cash is largely onshore so you have no problem returning to shareholder do you get your tax rate down to so far below tax rate and still generate primarily cash would comment our tax rate is all low is an awful lot of money to send to the tax collector aside tax inherently are complex and there a lot of thing can affect the tax rate especially a company somewhat unique global footprint footprint on a global including the benefit we with the National acquisition is allowing u to have a relatively effective current tax rate and further enabling u a high repatriation of cash which a you indiscernible of our cash home and we ended this with of our cash onshore for planning purpose a we into the future we assume the tax rate stay about the same incrementally at and we model on a goforward from a repat standpoint objective again is to maintain or more of our cash onshore so we have it to use for our shareholder or dividend and stock buyback for your well go to with off for so you have about in longterm debt and you have about in note payable you u what your plan are right now a far a paying back debt especially timing we do have a shortterm debt of come due on of had talked during our capital management strategy discussion back in debt clearly is to be a portion or part of our capital structure for quite a long especially given debt go out a far a year out in fact we continue including debt in our capital structure or rolling over portion of our debt if the economics made to u the definition of the economics making is if we can issue new debt at rate are either below our impression of what the inflation rate be or below our dividend yield with in mind cant forecast exactly what well wind up doing when come around clearly well be to pay off if we need to if the economics make we may very well decide to go ahead and replace with new debt followon a followon for you if youll answer it or not can you give any comment on which end market do on a relative in the but give you a consolation and about what they did in the in the this is not a comment industrial a we pointed out grew and continue to be strong Automotive grew for u being driven mainly by infotainment and advanced driverassist system such a blind spot detection parking assist a lot of those cool thing you see on car commercial these day aspire one day to have a car actually Computing notebook were weak and tablet grew heard some competitor talking about weakness in tablet Dont where came from They were strong for u Comms infrastructure the big word China in Operators in fact started deployment released contract of those contract went to China OEMs to European Ill note we sell to both maybe different product to different player but we expect to continue to enjoy in China Small cell trial are continuing What would is deployment we expect to happen call it mid to half of next Handsets the good news there is now sub of our revenue is legacy wireless keep down Consumer good recovery in revenue there after some of the inventory reduction in a game console comment mostly Digital television continues weak again sorry didnt answer the but hopefully there some value there you for your well hear from Wang with Wang Partners one for me you help u understand the underutilization charge in what you see for utilization in the guess in term of charge then also what you plan to exit the with in term of inventory both on the balance sheet and in the channel underutilization charge in the about down from about in the prior a mentioned with reduction in our factory loading expected during the expect charge to go up wont give you a forecast with an exact number yet be a function of exactly what our indiscernible turn out to be by the end of the it relates to inventory our model for inventory is to carry between and day of inventory closed the current to day room we would want to take those day up a bit more with the slowdown in demand in seems a and a slight opportunity for u to go ahead and bring those inventory day up a bit a we get ready to enter understood you basically you all your question in there to get to more caller well move on to the next please well go to from of Capital apologize want to put you in the spot but getting a lot of email and confused investor are confused Going back to the midquarter update you did longterm seasonality is then you also the variability is a lot the right way to about it is a decline up to for the last year so the last average so is it we misinterpreted in what were thinking Not modeling for down but the Street clearly higher than me so and hence theyre very close to ask Did we misinterpret your comment or did something change in the the key to looking at and all of is exactly true If you at average it down If you at the last year and take it out it down what you hear u talking about here are if you over the last year in case of the industry and both were excuse me it something down so guess the difference is the only real difference in term of how were discussing our own data is a meaningful change to if you take legacy wireless out obviously year year a very significant part of our revenue mix it an insignificant part of the mix any impact on seasonality frankly is what it did in the is irrelevant to our future the distinction were making at this point Do you have a followon Capital did to now what should now the legacy be gone when we go into next what should we be thinking about the normal seasonal pattern youll answer it and well back and ask you again for the quarter What the the math Ive done is if you at and you take legacy wireless out and you at the last year it flattish what encourage you to do we have all of data out on our and would be a great project for you to work on tonight and publish in your note tomorrow Thered be a lot of value added in again Ill Ill refer you to data and you do the math you well go to with Ill stick with the theme of a caller and stick to one Theres been a lot of activity in the lately relative to the sensor Theres been some MA activity in some of the peer this have grown in excess of the market have grown because theyve gained some share or had some opportunity in the sensor market do you feel about position in market Where do you see you there the one would in sensing space and obviously there are lot of different type of sensor and theyre different at some in the last anyway a few week we did an announcement of a breakthrough product category in inductive sensing which is basically an entirely new class of data converter and truly is innovative truly is breakthrough being when you at the size of in our portfolio of product it can be a breakaway success and it not to have a big impact on in term of moving the needle it a great example of the of innovation been taking place at over the last decade and why you see consistent share gain from our lot of people about innovation and a lot of time spun up in technical term simplify it and measure it by our we producing and innovating and developing product customer want we our market share tell the story provides the feedback of what is providing innovation is valued by our customer one example a broader than your sensing but absolutely a great space and were right in the middle of it go to with when you at the activity cancellation are falling you might not normally expect to see in the context of sum of order Are you seeing anything unusual either one way or the other from your customer Cancellations remain at what we would call very low level by historical standard and part of the reason why we feel this is a we were coming up on a seasonal not seeing anything in the on the cancellation front for example would indicate it anything weaker than normal a lot of people maybe were worried about well whats the effect of the government shutdown Is showing up in customer demand or anything not we have perfect visibly there but we didnt see backlog being pushed out by customer didnt see a higher rate of cancellation which we are both meaningful indicator Do you have a followup a followup a at the reported margin theyre almost around point more than what consensus is modeling for next year margin recognize your movement in revenue and hence utilization affect a we about the put and take assuming next is even a modest growth for SEMI conductor a we about the put and take on margin what could the consensus see right ie margin down point from current level or is perhaps consensus seeing thing wrong well guess would people a theyre putting their model together of a thing we at whats to drive our margin keep in mind a we fill these very costeffective factory we acquired over the last of year and especially a we fill them with a higher mix of industrial and automotive end markettype product were to see margin continue to be healthy Another important point to keep in mind is depreciation is running about point ahead of capital expenditure by definition mean depreciation start to work itself down over the next of year by itself be a boost margin those are the thing would point to and is again a we grow and fill up those factory a we improve our portfolio mix especially industrial and automotive and a depreciation decline over the next few year on these lower level of CapEx those together should provide nice tailwind to our margin a we go to the scenario talked about at a any of reasonable growth or any growth at all given those tailwind it doesnt sound the Street if theyre modeling down point on margin not sound consistent with what you described Is right sound inconsistent but also suggests missing exactly how much cash flow well generate next right you and operator were to try to squeeze in one final and then well wrap it up final from with you talked about some of the put and take for margin for next the roughly you were for of core OpEx in the of this x charge restructuring et cetera what sort of OpEx put and take should we of heading into the simplest suggest to you is clearly the people who are in RD and SGA the OpEx bucket a we call it are correctly anticipating theyll see pay and benefit increase in we would certainly see the effect of would also you in our OpEx typically is seasonally up from a function of thing one it the absence of the holiday period we see in the and the is the annual pay and benefit increase begin to take effect in the and take full effect in the again would expect the spend rate a we go into next begin to increase coming off a low Yearoveryear though given the winddown of the legacy wireless still yearoveryear attractive within our OpEx model in the to to of revenue excuse me being at the lower end of maybe even shorter to OpEx typically go up because of the pay and benefit increase described kick in in but also fewer holiday and vacation day taken in compared with see the benefit from those holiday and vacation day then it tends to work against u in the for your question in general were to stop here you for joining u of this call is on our today call you all for your',\n",
       "       'take our from with is on behalf of you are narrowing to the midpoint with this update could you give u any color on what seeing in the various end market in the and if any vertical are tracking incrementally better or worse than week What would is a you might guess with narrowing to the middle of the the is generally tracking with our expectation would both at the a well a within various major product line and end market had expected and we explained this even back in the call we expected the half growth we had in the industrial and automotive market would continue into the and in fact it also believed the recovery in the communication infrastructure market began in the would continue into the and it Finally we expected some of the area of weakness in the were driven by customer were reducing channel inventory in ahead of new product launch we expected demand would likely recover a those new product launch occurred in the call we specifically noted this included customer in the handset market a well a game console and notebook computer would note all of these area are growing again this Do you have a followon very helpful my followup could you comment on linearity of order pattern quartertodate not our usual practice to discus linearity at this point in the so Ill stick with practice here any comment we had on linearity we would make in the call you for your question go next to Chin with Chin Question on the comm infrastructure you discus whether it primarily your DSP product or is it other product area within your product portfolio seeing the benefit of comm infrastructure growth this if you at our comm infrastructure we shipped a broad set of product well see the different business of ship product into comm infrastructure if you of Embedded Processing a line of processor sit of a well a our custom ASIC the profile of those product of course be dependent on the customer but we are seeing a benefit to revenue across a wide of product category Do you have followon Chin term of your fab utilization rate is the plan you outlined at your last earnings call is tracking to plan or are there any change at this you bet expect average utilization to be up slightly this a we had expected you for your take our next from with and and can you a bit about book to bill and order trend throughout the guess what would on order in general theyve been solid this solid this and our backlog continue to expand quartertodate therefore quartertodate book to bill is greater than being a most of you have modeled our revenue typically seasonally decline due to the post backtoschool drop in our calculator based on we would expect and it would be typical for the backlog gain to likely diminish somewhat a the wind down exactly where we land well have to report at the end of the positive quartertodate but likely to get smaller before the end because of Do you have a followon and so to sort of go through what is normal seasonal for so semi are typically flat then you subtract off about point for the calculator Is the right way to about what a normal seasonal would be very consistent with our view If go through the data usually our calculator revenue decline by about following the backtoschool a you noted would then would then negatively impact the company growth by about percentage point in the if at historical average on a the sequential growth for the is a negative but also a of minus to plus Ill also you an outlier maybe it more useful to at the last year average where the decline is and largely explained by our calculator seasonality a long way of saying the same you to begin with right you for your question well go next to with calling in for can you a bit about your visibility and it sort of where is the relative source of strength not are you talking about when you where is the relative source of strength is an end market a where is your visibility strongest in what end market if you can about it way Oh understand have breakout for you the overall order trend but have how much backlog in term of by end market cant help you with one Do you have a followon Relative to your comm infrastructure comment earlier can you sort of break it out between wired and wireless and also by geography and anything you are seeing different than week Ill take one if you at our comms infrastructure revenue for the in the half represented about of our revenue overall have a detail underneath between wireless and wireline If were to make a stab at it would the majority would be tilted towards the wireless part of the industry the wireline would include thing IP phone and video conferencing medium gateway a well a the traditional networking and telecom equipment and then by geography from a wireless standpoint would were well positioned across all of the major OEMs we service and ship into industry well benefit seeing benefit a an example this a China of look it picking up heard u about last we benefited primarily in the a the carrier increased their spending you go next to Will with hoping you can shed some light on the Embedded Processing if you can about demand trend there in particular relative to your burgeoning microcontroller Will Embedded Processing should grow driven especially by strength in industrial and the automotive market were encouraged specifically because of the diversity of growth and we see growth from a wide of product line and end market inclusive of microcontrollers and were starting to see some of the benefit of the investment we had made there Do you have a followon Will related to the same if you wouldnt mind commenting on margin it would be very helpful is one at an analyst day last you set a margin target believe it for the EP and you were at a low point a quarter it recovered a bit in the last commentary either from a short or longterm perspective in term of your path to these much higher operating margin talked about in Will if you at the at where from a few thing were pressuring the operating margin of the obviously a we back a few quarter were operating in a very weak environment so pressuring the operating margin additionally a you heard u about before stepped out and made some significant investment in microcontrollers both in RD increasing the number of design team had in place a well a field application resource what were beginning to see now in the growth is a result of those investment and were encouraged by it we believe even last you saw significant increase in operating margin in believe well continue to see type of progress this a we move were on a path to have being a good contributor to at a Will we appreciate your call go next to Rolland with Rolland Capital wanted to a bit here you last notable expansion in margin given the EPS guidance still imagine hold true perhaps you could quantify a bit more now were a further through the here there no change to our view of the breakout we gave you revenue talked about operating expense expectation is it would be a down a of percentage point and we continue to believe we identified acquisition and restructuringother be right about and we continue to expect and somebody in the call did some quick math and they were coming up with about a margin which we affirmed in fact the correct math again no change to our view on any of Again margin benefit a lowermargin wireless continues to decline a highermargin and Embedded Processing product continue to grow we hold our capital expenditure stable at low level of or thereabouts the depreciation which we in for the prior more than point above the capital expenditure a a percentage of revenue continue to decline in the year ahead so again all of point to not only a healthy margin this but plenty of runway a long a the economic environment and our industry condition are conducive to growth being a told you plenty of time the real benefit the real consideration there is the cash flow margin where set our objective of to we in the of revenue the margin objective on which management is focused in running the operation of the Do you have a followon Rolland Capital sorry if missed it wireless winddown are your expectation still the same a they were at the end of the call you did not we havent addressed in fact what we in we expect it to decline by about this in fact continues to be our expectation what mean is at the middle of our revenue for this we would grow about despite decline in legacy wireless for the rest of our revenue would then result in growth of about again at the middle of our a a reminder legacy wireless revenue in the and we continue to expect it be essentially gone by the end of this with decline in the in the our legacy wireless revenue should be le than of overall revenue this for your question take our next from with Gabriel Ho is Gabriel Ho calling in for have appeared to turn around the Silicon Valley sooner than the early expectation you please help u understand what subsegments are driving and how tracking this with other segment Gabriel is Ill address the overall and put the Silicon Valley of context not because SVA is doing well but so are all of the other area we have we should see sequential growth from the this if you at this well see strongest growth of our power product a it disproportionately benefit from product launch had mentioned earlier in handset and gaming console a well a an overall recovery against a weak compare of notebook If you at an end market automotive should be a driver in growth specifically of HVAL a well a benefiting Embedded Processing then from an industrial market standpoint to continue to benefit Silicon Valley a well a HPA Do you have a followon Gabriel Gabriel Ho very helpful a followup have you any expansion in the lead at the channel what is your expectation on the channel inventory for the lead time overall have not changed and remain short no change on front from our standpoint keep in mind even though it not the only factor in lead time we have plenty of open capacity we fully would expect to be able to maintain short lead time even a growth might continue between the inventory we have positioned and the capacity we have to u our goal certainly is to keep lead time right in the same where they are where they are you for your question well go next to with calling in for following up on the strength in industrial automotive which is above seasonal for color you can provide in term of the trend seeing from an inventory perspective a well a resale would make a Ill about the part and then Ill about in general what were seeing with distribution when you about inventory different people have asked me about inventory at industrial customer how anybody directly observes inventory at industrial customer because they tend to be lot and lot of small customer purchase their product through distribution certainly are aware of whats on with inventory at distribution in term of their end customer would generally the role those customer play distributor pay distributor for is to carry inventory for them to the point they may be carrying some inventory on their own and is inventory growing or depleting frankly we have direct visibility would seriously doubt any semiconductor supplier do do you have some comment on distribution overall would specifically to inventory we expect day to change much of distribution in an environment where we expect revenue to increase about the same rate a our sale for the overall Do you have a followon any color on trend by geography Particularly Europe which seems to from the component perspective ticked up a bit any color there we pull the quartertodate trend so what so far is growth in Asia in the and Japan actually Europe down slightly Ill quartertodate see where we end up a we finish up the you for your question go next to with Sameer Kalucha is Sameer Kalucha calling in for you can provide some perspective on from your vantage point right now there some macro headwind or some thing floating around anything you see the potential to maybe derail a seasonal outlook for not aware of any a statement there are headwind or there a Sameer Kalucha Some macro concern hanging on maybe some geopolitical tension Oh yes have no idea how would translate to semiconductor demand so we have any real value to add in term of any commentary there me we talked about what typically is only real headwind is our calculator seasonality beyond well see have more comment in Do you have a followon Sameer Kalucha Followon is about the China buildouts mentioned it tracking in line with expectation you had earlier in term of compared with last the confidence is much higher you would Whatever the carrier are saying they spend do you theyre on track to do or is there anything can change it when you compare this to last this is maybe the in a row we were hoping to see followthrough from comms infrastructure standpoint and the difference in the confidence actually it happen in may wait to make comment of what we happen in Ill point out of our Embedded Processing we are benefiting from comms infrastructure and we certainly enjoy a very strong position there Ill also note we are seeing a very broad of growth including our microcontroller a well a our connectivity were excited about broadness and diversity of growth were seeing across a lot of different customer growing of what were looking to a we Sameer you for your well take our final from with Erik Rasmussen wanted to chime in here Erik calling in for Real quick how have customer order pattern changed given where were at in the current stage of guess the recovery if you can comment on mean we talked about in we actually saw some extension what Ill call extension in visibility meaning customer did a onetime transition to give u additional visibility out in is a tends to be a onetime effect we didnt expect necessarily to carry in the is generally tracking more with demand and demand expectation for the next or so do you have followon Erik Erik Rasmussen you addressed it a of time moving on to China mobile and the comm infrastructure side how do you see it been very slow with the rollouts obviously the number are out there TDLTE base station how you see tracking for you Is there a certain mechanism or a certain metric you are looking at for how it to impact your Ill add commented a of different way on it but we are benefiting specifically from LTE deployment can the majority of spend globally still remains on were enjoying a well our position strengthens a we move into LTE especially longerterm and even a you into small cell and thing are happening there both of those trend favor u in the future you a we wrap up here Ill note it a good day in the market the senior analyst took credit and went home early left their associate working we end the call me you a is on our you and good you everyone today you for your',\n",
       "       'your embedded can you a bit about what you are seeing in the wireless infrastructure market by the three go Europe and Asia particularly China we are and we some of this when we talked about our result and a midquarter next week so promised me wouldnt steal any thunder from or he would kill me is what he the way would categorize if you at wireless infrastructure over we again had a very strong position and it been up and down in term of whats happening in the market in term of capital spending and deployment and so on and so forth have strength in the you read the same paper a do see whats happening in term of China deployment would characterize a a strengthening environment positive for u in the and would at the back half of the a a strengthening environment is the guidance would provide What it look in term of it anyones guess the in total continue to there be some volatility a capital dollar are spent and deployment happened secularly it still a great marketplace and there is continued expansion in term of the opportunity again macro plus small cell Over the longterm we it a great market but there are to be some ebb and flow depending on CapEx expenditure by the operator and so on and so forth and how ripple through to the region but my comment would be take one away we would it a strengthening environment Inaudible am not familiar with the comment may have been a macro comment is a comment would hold through on the embedded portion of what we are seeing in automotive Again when about how spend my where last week dealing with customer winning new design Theres a long lead between winning those design and having those go into production feel very good about what we are winning and what mean for the future if you at attach rate and dollar content for ADS system and infotainment there is still a dramatic opportunity in front of u in term of the semiconductor content in those system for the next year it is a dramatically expanded opportunity from where we are Inaudible it part of the opportunity is trickle down part of the opportunity is a lot of the stuff is option and so you to at option take rate and what are penetration rate Ill take it from a personal standpoint back to my five child analogy when buy a car now for my kid it more safety feature in it so they didnt have the eight small accident have happened because they havent been paying attention and my bias would be to spend the money on some of those option in the next car buy because the capability is absolutely compelling have for one more if anybody one remember if the ARM bit processor fall under embedded at but if it can you about your design win the pipeline and how do you differentiate KeyStone versus some of the other ARM processor are out there If you at our ARM investment and you bit but you at generically what we are investing in from an ARM technology havent made any announcement on bit or anything else but in the class device of the KeyStone architecture platform and the platform where it is very very important what we are doing with those product is a combination of general purpose capability which is ARM in this context along with other element by particular problem so in our hawking device which we have announced actually four and DSPs eight of our DSPs chip is actually at the core of the HP Moonshot so what you see there is it not an offering of ARM versus an class architecture the benefit of what can do with the other integration with some of capability to of transform the power for performance power point we can hit by leveraging the DSP technology a well so there are all system on a chip class implementation we are doing ARM is an ingredient of technology but it balanced with other factor am very bullish on in total get our power per watt power per dollar performance per dollar number we can hit with those class of product and you put them up against you put them up against power PCs you put them up against FPGAs for those who still want to do their own architecture we are incredibly competitively positioned to have being expanding part of our a we move but again it not necessarily attacking market exist may be market are being served with other technology FPGAs for those who still want to do their own architecture power PCs our product line in total is an opportunity for u to expand dramatically into the embedded space Inaudible it remains to be in term of exactly how big an opportunity is What tell you is we are not playing is an ARM consolidator where anybody can do it with an ARM license and a founder relationship are bringing a higher of solving a system issue where people are to invest to try to take advantage of what the architecture could do are out of so much appreciate you',\n",
       "       'this well take a from can you walk u through the margin expectation for the what are the put and take on how you get to what you called notable margin improvement in what to see with legacy wireless declining by about next lowermargin revenue is to be displaced by highermargin revenue with the form of and Embedded Processing to get the bigger piece addition with our growing backlog and a higher revenue expectation for the well be utilizing more of our factory capacity a you of run through all talked a moment about our operating expenditure wed expect to be down a of percent over quarteroverquarter and restructuring and acquisition cost to be about in the you squeeze math on through and youll see our profit margin continue to increase a it this last Do you have a followon do have a followon If at your and forgive me if doing this math wrong but it right If at your revenue le Wireless yearonyear in the it still actually a negative number based on your guidance it be positive in the Question is do you your revenue le Wireless actually be positive for the Oh Ill you try to extrapolate what done yeartodate out and into the with the legacy wireless down a significantly a it be in the and before we expect it to be much by the we get into variable much filled in for you can make some estimate on what the rest of the revenue could to make the assessment of whether were to be up overall without legacy wireless take a from with if could add the improvement were seeing across the industry in the comms early stage can you offer some perspective on and how long do you could potentially last What the put and take there would be and talking specifically about infrastructure there so at least what my comment be actually broad growth across geography is being led by North and it being led by some of the player late last in term of operator announced they would be doing capital spending increase this after several quarter of what Ill is not a lot of activity we did see real result in again it broader than North Looking into the back half of the were still optimistic well actually of all me what were seeing in North is a combination of continued WCDMA deployment but also accelerating LTE deployment a well again a you we play quite strongly across both the new LTE technology a well a the more entrenched WCDMA so were seeing strength on the combination term of China we many other people are waiting to see the impact of and whether in fact well see half deployment clearly our expectation some activity more so from the standpoint of customer getting prepped for in Japan we havent actually the bear ph left and much consistent with at least my understanding of what other player have been describing a well there Do you have a followon apologize if missed this because cut off briefly did you your plan for factory loading is to be for the back half of the compared to the half if heard your correctly asking what our plan were for factory loading in the back half of the versus the half our loading have been stepping up Second higher than and we would expect to be higher than on the of our growing backlog Beyond we have enough visibility to comment on what the might so well wait another to day before we comment on you the next be from with Question on on profitability have and Embedded Processing close to historical high may be high historical high Embedded processing is close Profitability though look a bit pressured though even with le OpEx and higher margin this assume to get better next a margin go up and OpEx down a bit could you give u some guess a more color on how you see profitability by your of trending a we go to the and maybe even share anything around longerterm target you might want to give u begin by reminding you especially if you at compare u to prior certainly compare u yearoveryear the profitability in those segment are to be somewhat pressured by the typically by virtue of the fact eliminated the Wireless so mean the remaining corporate expense is spread over fewer unit so therefore the corporate allocation are higher alone is to be depressed in any comparison to prior period other guess talked about on the Embedded Processing you may recall about year we significantly began to step up the investment we had in area especially in support of our objective for our microcontroller product a mentioned on last quarter call those investment are at a sufficient now they not they do not need to be increased anymore were at the point now where were looking for revenue growth in the Embedded Processing to begin to generate some real profit may also recall one of our more profitable piece of is in the comms infrastructure to the we had a moment were beginning to see some sign of picking up this ideally continues and generates quite a bit of additional profit fallthrough a well Did answer your here you did very helpful If can add one if you at the same at the and try to go back and leap when we of went back and looked at versus prior period in history you can find at least compared with the historical period where revenue similar but margin maybe were a higher or whatever a we thought to a lot of come down to the difference in capacity for example one of the one if remember right late in when we were absolutely capacityconstrained if you at where we are and our position to be able to support growth and provide service level our customer expect from u based upon the capacity we have it a world of difference we where we are right now and we how thing are headed into the on front a well Do you have a followon do Along those line around the margin for next my math suggests you may be implicitly guiding to a margin of maybe even a more guess can you give me some feeling whether or not math is accurate and some feeling of the relative magnitude of driver have Wireless mix obviously down mix of investment is maybe up utilization up you also have some fab closure the inch fabs start to hit in if not mistaken you give u some guess some feeling to the relative magnitude of some of those driver appreciate it you did a good job citing the answer would have given you to a to whats driving increase in profit margin Youre exactly right on those point seeing utilization with the mix improving quite a bit and were beginning to see the early sign on list be some of the saving from the closure of those older inch factory we talked about it a tossup between mix and improved utilization we see on there a we move after it to be mix is to be impacting favorably our margin a we keep moving for your question be from with look to me guiding your core you up about about double normal seasonality you give u any color on either the product segment or the end market are driving normal seasonality please a is normally our practice want to try to dissect it by end market or by product line beyond what identified typically seasonally we see a additional lift from calculator and no different this but not a big factor Probably the biggest single swing factor be what we described already in term of the decline for legacy wireless and of course would depress from to the total amount for the beyond we would more of what in in but also some of the area were still not lifting in and maybe holding back growth even in seasonally typically are stronger in so beyond noting some of the computing and handset area see seasonal strength in me of stop there if can Do you have a followon and hopefully get a closer with this one you about the OpEx side your color great for the and for the full should we when you get to normalized OpEx for and all the cost saving et cetera are gone how should we about the growth rate in OpEx versus whatever we assume core growth in revenue would be into et cetera the of the high OpEx guideline we have offered to the investor community is we would expect to be operating with OpEx between and of revenue mean clearly what would mean is in period of lower revenue well be higher percent period of higher revenue lower percent More specifically to your a to cost trend a Ive mentioned earlier we stepped up investment quite a bit over the last of year mainly in the microcontroller portion of Embedded Processing and also in the overall sale footprint we have on a global would expect a we out over the next to year rate of investment increase is to slow down considerably a we begin to get revenue leverage off of investment a we would expect revenue growth to provided growing market and a growing global economy would expect revenue growth to outstrip our OpEx growth by a fairly sizable portion Beyond wont be any more you can take to a we expect our overall bottom line result to continue to improve a these last few quarter you move to with in your comment you talked about SVA gaining share in the of given the core expectation of of highsingledigit sequential growth to what extent do you this is share gain versus what seeing in the overall market being of if industrial and auto drove do we expect sort of the consumer market with normal seasonality to be a bigger driver in the core for for sorry of all your comment on SVA it did gain share in also it gained share in a well a in for the last quarter it gained market share what we would expect in very likely given been gaining share we would expect to continue to gain share in but until everybody come out with their guidance maybe more importantly when they actually out with actual result were speculating about market share it what you more continued strength in the industrial and automotive area a well a some broadening of strength into other area heard from multiple company reporting now a well a what we and there are certain player in the handset market were running relatively weaker demand in a lot of had to do with some resetting some inventory level in their channel our expectation is well see strengthen back up about to Ill call it more normalized run rate for those player in addition to the seasonal lift come along in the Do you have a followon a followon for guess a we about the new model you in the of a target grossop margin of believe and If you at the implied guidance for the basically a stone throw away from those number Kind of a Wireless go to and you start to see continued leverage in the model should we start to be thinking about structurally higher target growth in op margin than given out in the we gave those of guideline a number of year when we made the decision to discontinue further investment in our baseband portfolio so we could at least give the analyst community and investor a a to what to expect this portfolio to be able to do clearly were beginning to see those result play themselves out What we have talked about here in the last few quarter in fact even started talking about a year at our analyst meeting is a focus on cash flow what would tell you to about is in term of what our objective are is to be converting to of our revenue into cash flow which a heard u mention several time now we intend to return to our shareholder through dividend and buyback le any amount we have to use for debt repayment sort of the bottom line is our cash flow objective on this expect the actual margin in vehicle they fall out they be richer than historically had in the by virtue of the construct of our portfolio wont try to offer any new number a to what we target number are on those because we want to set ourselves at of limit aiming at maximizing cash flow for our shareholder since your followup believe on the line me ask and in fact answer the natural followup to your followup which is so with cash flow margin objective of to and reporting for the are those objective in fact something should be reviewed guess the way we at now to answer part of the of your way we at is at current level were now operating in the top top percentile of the SP reflects the strength of our model so do we is to the right number way we evaluate is if we get to the point where were consistently performing above well then consider whether we should change the but right now our margin objective a a corporation is to convert to of revenue to cash flow a for those great question this well go to with you about the linearity of booking during the then considering how the product mix and market mix changed what should we be thinking about for normal seasonality for the linearity the answer is similar to what it normally is which is order were noisy in the cant at it monthtomonth and try to draw any straight line in one direction or the other a bit even more so this because you noted we customer were giving u more extended visibility so depending upon when those customer chose to load up in term of the backlog for the outquarter drove some of the noisiness it a more so than normal and Ill give you one example Comms infrastructure had an especially strong and exactly what describing They were from their exact number but let they had month of visibility on our backlog placed then they were pushing out to month much loaded in during the of and created some of the noisiness there some of stuff on in term of with all the change in our portfolio whether to translate to anything different for of have to move given the breadth of and Embedded Processing you can go at more industry number and try to ass if you at average growth historically average been Again we always give the caution the on is huge to not how useful amount number is is down more so fact if you at the average it down is a completely not useful number because of the noise believe it introduced into where we had a down high point on is down to sorry the minus to plus of what a normal is down a bit because semiconductor product tend to move more sideways in type of then you have some the pressure of calculator coming off of their backtoschool peak in pushing down into clearly not evident in the average growth rate number gave you Do you have a followon you maybe give u a of what the inventory did during the and how their booking pattern is Is there any commentary hearing from them have booking we in remark the inventory declined and yet so actually at an absolute dollar went down to a under week sorry me start over a an absolute dollar standpoint distributor inventory stable a day it went down about day to below week in the you go to with of Capital and this is not a followup to any followup but it a followup to your remark Clarification on the connectivity who did you sell it to then assuming this includes only the handsetrelated and not the embedded part we wont disclose who it we entered into transaction with would mention again it further effort on our part to try to monetize those prior investment in technology What we transferred their a right for buyer to use technology including some tangible deliverable we provided to particular buyer a nonexclusive arrangement allows u to fully use the technology a we have in the and importantly to continue to pursue the market strategy we have for which to take technology into place where it beginning to emerge in the the common is the Internet of Things but to more and more different area where were finding wireless connectivity of technology being useful and emerging of it more along the line of the legacy wireless a opposed to the Embedded we believe this have any impact you might on our embedded opportunity Again it mean by which were continuing to monetize legacy wireless Do you have a followon Capital did on the core and to see the SVA of on trajectory laid out last of quarter it done well you help u understand and mean to make light of it because market share gain are never easy it blocking and tackling stuff or because it couldnt be new product have been developed since the acquisition any color you could provide on what been working would be great would perhaps what beginning to see here remember SVA a lot of it revenue through the industrial channel a well a the automotive and clearly those market have been doing well importantly the industrial it mean a lot of customer including a lot of small customer where the benefit of an extremely large sale force play in versus what national could have done on it own in the simply didnt have the sale force scale to be able to reach out to a many customer the combination of nice growth in the market in which it in and the fact were able to get product out to a lot more customer in those space are coming together to help u see some nice growth in then overall better commercial term with customer may recall they had previously gotten themselves into a bit of hot water with some customer where they were no longer welcome on design been welcomed back in those some of those design are in fact already beginning to turn into some of those all already turning into incremental revenue me add you recall when we announced acquisition we the entire on which were to generate a return on this acquisition is based on revenue synergy we thought possible not cost synergy mean there were some cost synergy but they were minor compared to the revenue synergy we thought were possible through our combination it absolutely Ill understate it and call it encouraging to see those revenue synergy coming through coming through at the rate they are and on the timeline they are good news from our perspective there you for your question this well go to with or one on the underutilization charge What were they in the and what do you project number to be in the we havent been providing a projection on but they were a bit le than in the downsized we beneficial to last Do you have a followon do a clarification again dollar inventory were roughly flat in distribution down on a days’ but you resale are up but your organic grew trying to understand what sort of the how do reconcile all of other word the organic being up but your resale being up only but inventory being flat obviously this is different cross current in distribution and customer base than what we have overall and what we have associated with our direct wouldnt mean we clearly understand it guess would it to be very customerspecific in term of what asking is why were resale growing slower than revenue overall would it tends to get customerspecific want to get into Also keep in mind our overall benefit from the lift we see in calculator again would be revenue a opposed to the resale and then also some of the marketspecific thing again it get somewhat marketspecific but also customerspecific there you for your question well move along to with on the prepaid it about a use of cash due to the my understanding guess it a tech transfer reverse and unwind Has become a source of cash could you go through the accounting mechanic on way work is a we have met the requirement of the agreement we signed late in the it a recognizable event therefore it recognized into earnings payment term were such we expect to get paid on the majority of until this in fact exactly what you is whatll occur it because it in net income it taken out on the prepaid line and other asset so appears to be a use of cash in fact it reverse itself when we move into the because we in fact had already received the payment due in the Do you have a followon a simple so when your dollar of distributed inventory are flat mean your resale equal your sellin dollar are flat mean resale equal sellin Not necessarily because it depends upon what distributor the distributor were doing with inventory in the prior for example if you have to play with the number if they were reducing inventory one they held inventory flat the next you could see resale trend resale growth trend well below our revenue growth a revenue of call it snapped back to the way it shipping out there not always a direct what do there not always a direct alignment between revenue growth or shipment into distribution and what theyre shipping out because it varies based on what theyve been doing in term of adding or depleting inventory clearly with u having customer sorry distributor converting to consignment can impact u a well because the impact of a consignment conversion is the is basically theyre depleting inventory and depleting at a lesser rate a we go so and apologize if missed this so what were resale versus sellin had resale about let see resale were up sic Off the top of my head have have sellin actually it up slightly more in a of point more than is what it look you moving well go to with notable change in lead time and anything you might you might trend higher in the back half of the Lead time would generally stable with the majority of our product shipping in le than week no real change there Do you have a followon and if there any color you can give u on end market dynamic and the stuff mentioned in term of computing or automotive or anything have a of comment here industrial guess from what were saying already market continues to recover would in general customer in space are hand to mouth Theyre keeping inventory lean have not sign of any of broad replenishment there lead time for our product there are short and theyre taking advantage of term of automotive heard u our revenue strong go across both a well a Embedded Processing of is clearly the market the end market is strong of it is is benefiting from design win in a of area is the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems a well a infotainment also seeing new opportunity in a of area advanced radar system for example partly the driver there such a blind spot detection were seeing radar technology in automobile start to get deployed much broader than certainly ph consideration much broader than blind spot detection Computing no surprise there news flash is the overall market been weak continues to be weak see what happens when some of the new processor get introduced here in the half but space been weak Comms infrastructure Ive much what can about Communications or handset rather the the big story for is ongoing decline in legacy wireless were actually doing well in the broader handset market with some of the other product we have audio amplifier et cetera if you at market overall it getting for swamped out by whats happening at certain customer in term of their own adjustment but then also our legacy wireless trend then the consumer would game console were weak last a we have manufacturer in space preparing for new product introduction and transition here in the half Television would describe a generally weak there new technology are being introduced hold some promise for growth there overall would the market is weak about it all right you for your question well move along to with of wanted to address this demand environment being asked in different way from a geographic perspective much of the growth seeing right now is centric versus coming from China and Europe the macro data point from China and Europe are still quite mixed if you could get u give u a of how demand is from a geographic perspective me give you the data and then Ill you figure out how to interpret it if you at our revenue in the we saw the highest growth and this on a dollar out of Asia followed by the followed by Japan Europe down what would characterize a meaning a of percent all region were up Asia the strongest from a dollar standpoint but it also where over what of our revenue is shipping these day then the strongest in term of percentage growth but it much smaller than what Asia is for u then the only caution to always attach to is you have to be a careful mean Asia is where a lot product are being manufactured and then turned around and shipped back to other market such a the for consumption it not a statement about economic condition or change there in those market it strictly a matter of our customer manufacturing in those various region Do you have a followon a a clarification what percentage of the sale now are dist versus direct then within if you could give u a split of sellin versus sellthrough of our revenue go to distribution now If you at distribution revenue about of is now supported by consignment a a proxy for your sellin versus sellout officially and technically were on sellin recognition with distribution the half of the revenue on consignment behaves sellout in the distributor revenue doesnt get recognized until they pull it out of consignment hardware out of consignment inventory to then directly ship it to a customer it behaves sellout more broadly about of our overall revenue now is supported by consignment andor JIT program so if you of put all together mean only about of our revenue is not on consignment or on or in distribution reason point out is because where we have consignment we have good visibility into customer or distributor inventory level in fact for distributor more broadly even where theyre not on consignment we what their inventory is the point being for about of our Ill call revenue coverage we have good insight into inventory when we characterize them a lean or wellmanaged guess is maybe a different word to of a of now we do with direct visibility not on consignment or not a distribution we have the same of visibility a any supplier where on a normal backlog where you to customer but were not seeing it directly for we have good visibility and we feel good about where inventory are right now in our channel and our customer you for your question this well take a from with a about some of the extended visibility you your customer are providing to you the lead time not changed why do you the customer are giving you extended visibility guess is it a simple a theyre feeling more confident about the in the half you give a more color on it a combination of thing part of it a they get more comfortable with their own forecast and their own outlook they are theyre more comfortable putting call it commitment associated with backlog on their supplier part of it the other part of it and how to weigh one versus the other is frankly or some of competitor are out talking to customer of signaling potential upcoming lead extension when happens the customer for their own benefit go ahead and try to get backlog placed typically when they do they place backlog where they lead time are out Theyre to place backlog for full system so theyre were seeing some of a well again some of it is customer sorry competitorinduced where theyre concerned about their ability to support the full customer demand and their capacity situation and then the other part of it is customer increased confidence in their own demand for their own product Do you have a followon guess following up on and guess to the extent you have the visibility do you see the customer and distributor wanting to put on a more inventory a we go through the holiday season and again realizing your capacity utilization is still a lot lower than your competitor guess you would see a an opportunity to of pick up some market share there Again there some natural inventory go along with getting ready for a seasonal holiday build at this point would try to distinguish between higher demand versus inventory replenishment especially where we have consignment for distribution of our revenue inventory build of chip Now not reflecting u anything about the customer end product inventory situation inventory of chip there is no no such Basically we manage the consignment inventory to a certain turn so we take responsibility for you for your question from with is on CapEx in the you talked about having sufficient capacity right now to get to about in revenue meaning keeping the CapEx low is it safe to here this is sort of the low for at least the near we are still holding our forecast for the at about a you pointed out spent this and we spent about last may recall we did announce we were acquiring an assembly test site in Chengdu China of course require some cash in the half for u to go ahead and close on transaction expect well still stay in our overall budget for the then again for modeling purpose would expect u to be at above of revenue into CapEx up to of revenue at which point in may change Although would also point out it is our objective to keep watching for inexpensive capacity and to the extent we can get and extend ceiling for variable price we be very opportunistic and open to strategy Do you have followon one followup this is a you didnt discus much on this call but it certainly a highprofile the sell into smartphones and tablet could you a bit about how faring in the current environment please guess what would is from a even in thing mentioned midquarter and might have mentioned earlier in this call in area audio amplifier relatively lowprofile device we they get headlined a lot or whatever but we have a strong and broad position in the handset with those type of product we feel good about our progress there and position also being those market are more vertical theyre more concentrated so in this of environment meaning when you have big customer making inventory adjustment or whatever they catch up part of our a well a all of our competitor play into those space we did see some softness associated with in the good news is again our exposure there is much lower than it historically been a it is in the market so when you get those vertical market making those kind of adjustment it doesnt have the same of impact on certainly it would have in our hopefully answer your with were to wrap up you for joining u of this call is on our again this today call you all for your may now',\n",
       "       'well take our from with guiding in line on revenue again ph but wondering if within the mix of your there any deviation from what you thought might occur over the course of the either product mix or geographic mix can give you some review of you noted the is generally tracking consistent with our expectation Along those line strength broadened across both customer and market during the a we had expected when we gave our guidance strength in the industrial market we saw in the continued into the a a reminder the industrial market it important to u but we expect it be even more important to our future a we focus more and more of our investment in space serve market mostly through catalog product line such a Silicon Valley our highperformance product line a well a some of the product line in Embedded Processing such a microcontrollers Automotive also continues to grow such a we saw in the serve the automotive market through a of product including both catalog and applicationspecific product OMAP application processor and also DLP product the communication market were seeing some growth in communication infrastructure this on a sequential a well a some growth in handset the handset been through a of catalog product such a audio amplifier we sell into space Revenue from our legacy wireless product line decline a we continue to wind them down and a we had expected and communicated PCs and notebook are weak this a we had expected then finally would note consumer is mixed with area gaming console weak specifically gaming console weak and other area in consumer mostly tracking sideways this Do you have a followon hear you thing industrial is to become a greater proportion of your and a you a is obviously still in the sort of the mix of some degree of transition can you describe what your model is to or year from now it rare to get a long sort of on this of call but do you feel you have room for your model to improve from where it stand Do you it sort of an upwardsfacing trajectory not to break from the model communicated previously which is our expectation we certainly have the capacity and the expectation to generate to of cash flow from our revenue being clearly with the capacity position we have which is very strong and an improving product mix and if you at for example margin and the income statement side of thing a simple point out is last depreciation of revenue and capital spending is actually below of revenue and we expect itll hold at until were able to cross of revenue clearly you would expect financially we have room for improvement and a good runway ahead of u there appreciate your question be with me ask the quickly a far a the trajectory of this upturn if you at your guidance it coming in more along seasonal line than of above seasonal of if you a reflection of still uncertainty in the macro environment because typically the off the bottom you tend to see betterthanseasonal growth trying to get a of how you are of viewing the cyclical recovery for the industry what were seeing thus far is a very wellbehaved recovery clearly what can cause rapid acceleration would be thing lead time starting to extend and then customer feeling they need to layer in more inventory and cause a surge in demand cause lead time to go out further frankly is not a particularly healthy environment one where the macro is providing support for growth in the electronics industry which then put higher demand on our product where were able a we are right now both because of our strong capacity position to maintain lead time are short and also with our inventory position to be able to service customer demand a it come in is a very wellbehaved and wellcontrolled upturn frankly versus the former case we would much rather have a wellbehaved upturn again this is midquarter we still have to go through this and well see whats ahead but what were seeing right now is very encouraging in term of growth the broadening of growth a earlier across customer in various end market and especially our ability to service demand in an environment frankly where when we across various competitor were already seeing some thing make u believe competitor for example are taking action to try to get customer to give more extended visibility to avoid lead extension upside demand from particular customer in what Ill call an unfair share of demand coming way where customer are citing competitor are not able to respond to their increased demand in a nearterm type of environment again we find the current environment very encouraging right now Do you have a followon to follow on from can you quantify of what the share gain might be for you in this environment clearly some of the rationale of being of having a much capacity a you do the ability to gain share when you at the guidance what do you is industry growth versus perhaps gaining share impossible for u to or for u to even get at this point not trying to imply to see some big step function in term of share gain for not the case frankly even though do believe agree with what saying the capacity position we are in can be and is starting to become a competitive advantage for even here and now not the rationalization rationalization we good price on capacity and were to be able to generate good return on capacity over a to certainly certain period were starting to enter it can be a nearterm competitive advantage but we at those capacity investment more from the standpoint of some attractive return were to be able to generate on those investment you for question with Last on the update you talked about how your booktobill trending you about how booking and backlog are trending and u what a typical sequential growth look and to Ill answer your on backlog and booking Ill you answer the about typical would in general would describe order this a strong turn level we expected would be high because of our short lead time and in the nature of the customer right now to try to stay handtomouth They have been high this a but again tie to our ability to deliver strongly in term of service level and ontime delivery with those short lead time being Ill also note we are building backlog again this to your on booktobill it is expanding greater than again this would customer are beginning to provide a more extended visibility for with their backlog in this case giving u some visibility out into even do you want to about typical rate Ill Ill give you our average sequential growth in and this is our number Allin we have a on average increase over and the Ill you on those data point obviously very noisy and the on those data point from flat to up can tell it noisy from standpoint Do you have a followon Do you have a followon in response to Johns you mentioned been able to gain share because some of your competitor werent able to you maybe expand on Do you see your competitor lead time stretching out leaving the customer winding down maybe about a bit and how able to react to and again a narrow example gave one of those thing you would expect to see early in a recovery want to try to translate it into some big broad trend in the industry what would is we have where customer demand for their product are starting to pick up theyre coming in with relatively nearterm request in term of wanting product so much the competitor in this particular case extending lead time or anything an lead request from the customer the competitor couldnt deliver to it and we could so we our unfair share of or shouldnt unfair share of we our due share of but it shifted somewhat from a competitor more directly to for your question with our next to push a bit further on the booking did you actually see the momentum have you been seeing it grow through the Has it each week you see a higher of booking or are saying it staying on a high plateau it began with Oh of order linearity always guess what would is we felt in general throughout the order have been strong hasnt been every daybyday or weekbyweek getting stronger a any noisy in general would describe the order trend this a having been strong Do you have a followon you give u any sort of feel for what the sequential growth of your core is If we sort of back out mean your guidance what implies for your core because you have some exiting are coming down and you have the seasonality of your calculator right mean is it still about to sequential growth for your core semiconductor a of thing there calculator growth typically add about point of growth to our a pointed out the decline in legacy wireless this have about same impact or an offsetting impact meaning the legacy wireless revenue lower our sequential growth by about point alone those the legacy wireless and the calculator trend for the most part are offsetting so would give you an indication of where and embedded are they may not again we see difference within those area HPA or highperformance and the Silicon Valley both with their very good exposure into the industrial and automotive market run a bit above and some other area be running a bit below but of a normal mix up there you for your question with Sec have our next of the other diversified semicompanies Avago and Microchip have raised guidance recently or talked about accelerating trend in the industrial space do you reconcile versus your comment is good but at from your comment it doesnt sound it better than what you thought when you gave guidance back in take a stab at in the case of Microchip their recent guidance raise took their midpoint to which slightly below the midpoint of growth for which for the revenue we initially described in and are reaffirming Devices came out not too long with their guidance for theyre off believe by a versus our but the midpoint of their guidance is and to be honest didnt follow the detail of Avago but when at the peer guidance and what were seeing were seeing very similar and describing very similar thing in our market Do you have a followon any visibility you could give u on the Comm infrastructure space you mentioned it a growth area this but how are you thinking about China LTE into the back half of the Ill take one me make it the comment in the context of Embedded Processing we do expect we have growth in Embedded Processing both driven from industrial a well a automotive market and in addition to communication infrastructure and were seeing strength in Comms infrastructure primarily driven by spending by North American operator and with some sign of increased activity of China were beginning to see benefit flowthrough the with our next and ask a bit about distributor inventory If you at some of the company recognize revenue on sellin they had some of the best guidance for the relative to normal seasonal wondering imply the channel is building some inventory in you a bit about Ill take would overall our expectation for resale through distribution be itll grow a few point if you at the inventory they own we should hold about the same a what we exited last at and around week definitely lean by any measure wed have also you about half of our distribution inventory is supported by our consignment program the fact we do recognize everything technically by a shift in method inventory andor sale behave exactly a if it were sellthrough do have a followon some of the swing you might normally see for sellin type of player with inventory building and depleting be dampened a we move more revenue toward consignment Do you have a do you have a followon and do might be mincing hair but when you guided you TV to be a bit weak now saying within the consumer only gaming is weak imply TV a bit better than you thought might be wrong and you have you may have your note directly in front of you from last call believe when talked about what we were seeing in television in referencing the more so than our expectation for normally try not to get into a lot of end marketspecific expectation for our guidance to my knowledge TV not weakened versus our expectation understanding is what were seeing in the television market currently is some growth in the very large screen of the market and not much growth in the of midsize and smallerscreen market not aware there been a change in trend other than what at least from our expectation for your question one from with of you about the factory utilization change versus what you were planning back in expecting utilization to be up this basically supporting the higher of demand we see coming in we have comment on whether it changed versus our expectation in for you though Do you have a followon is slightly unrelated question to what you generally comment on the call but is there a way to tactically use your excess capacity a a foundry for other customer compete with you guess theoretically we could but we have no intention to do fact if you fill capacity up with care whether it low margin mean whether it foundry or lowmargin in general then when you need it you have the capacity utilized and not what our strategy is do not believe we have too much capacity we explained in our call back in on our capital management strategy our strategy for capacity is to purchase it opportunistically and therefore get good price for it and then to position capacity ahead of or well ahead of demand our view is a growth return and it is already our capacity is quickly becoming a competitive advantage for a before there a lot of discussion seems amongst analyst and investor about pressure on margin what would is keep in mind only about half of the underutilization expense associated with our capacity is cashbased other half is a noncashbased it minimal impact on our cash flow more importantly having our the strong capacity we do have and having it acquired at the of very attractive price we did by buying it when frankly there wasnt a lot of demand for the capacity in our industry from other competitor mean our cash flow is to be strongly benefited not only but also in the future mentioned before but Ill reiterate our capital expenditure are already at historic low and were to be able to sustain those low level for year ahead getting those asset for penny on the dollar are to provide year of benefit to our cash flow and a heard u before higher cash flow is what allows u then to commit to higher return to our shareholder both dividend and repurchase while some may be sitting on the sideline waiting for margin to start to lift our cash flow is already lifting and in fact the benefit in the form of higher dividend and repurchase you for your question operator we have for one more Certainly sir and from with Capital Capital can focus in a bit on the CapEx are you running to date there is there any should we be thinking your capital spend this could have some lumpiness believe saw an announcement of some investment in assembly and test asset have a midquarter update on our capital expenditure What can is we are confident in the of guidance provided which believe is of capital expenditure for the Those can always be somewhat lumpy from quartertoquarter but the is our plan there no reason for u to believe otherwise by the way should compare our guidance on depreciation is you whats to happen to a we hold capital spending at lower level the what you might be referring to is in term of the assembly test site is last week we announced we had selected the location of Chengdu in China where we already have an existing wafer fab a the site for our next assembly test facility there be not create any lumpiness in term of capital expenditure what mean by is we continue to spend not impact our forecast for this not impact our guidance we be able to maintain CapEx at of revenue until we achieve or exceed of revenue then from then well be tracking to of revenue Chengdu announcement we also talked about our future investment in location could total up to keep in mind over the next year and when making these kind of longrange sitetype planning for our manufacturing operation they genuinely are longrange have to get site selected well in advance of actually spending money and what announcement all about Do you have a followon Capital do and give me clarification exactly what looking for followon though is a bit of a clarification to the way you answered a few question earlier this afternoon it in regard to seasonal pattern then the other felt you were possibly answering the seasonal impact of want to make understand the average guidance for growth for and what would excluding the impact of the change mix were expected to experience there you talking specifically about the legacy wireless what provided on average over the last year grown he it had a to so you can decide whether average number is particularly useful what done over the last year if you in we indicated our wireless revenue the legacy wireless revenue would decline about from the which would put it roughly in the of in the current have a update for you here at the midquarter on number but our expectation is or so of legacy wireless revenue in continue to decline until it essentially into the by the of would be a consideration a it is a consideration this nor were trying to specifically endorse average growth rate for for this particular we were communicating what average growth rate been historically you for your question before we end the call me you the is on our you and good lady and gentleman today you for your Have a great day',\n",
       "       'well take our from with guess for you we about the allocation of OpEx to the and Embedded a moving away from Wireless one is it sort of along a you thought it would in whats the pattern we should expect to see in term of and Embedded profitability a we go through the rest of the allocation talking about is the talking about the allocation of the corporate expense Right again to repeat what Ive mentioned a moment because we now have le cost corporate cost allocate to fewer segment the burden by those remaining segment be up cost of the corporate activity doesnt scale one for one with the cost of the actual operation consequently while down a bit it wont down near to the magnitude the inherent cost down a we wind down the Wireless the result of the allocated cost to remaining segment be higher you can see incrementally if you at the segment we published on a goforward those allocated cost down a bit over but not significantly result is though a we see revenue growth on the we should see the profitably of the segment continue to improve a Wireless wind down from here those allocated cost increase further to and Embedded or are they basically at the run rate for the Theyre close to the run rate for the theyre to be at right do you have a followon do had some of your peer about growth in the and basically suggest thing are growing but maybe not growing at a stellar rate wonder if you can about your order linearity in the how you how progressed and maybe your view on sort of the steepness or shallowness a it were of the cycle were in guess afraid have a lot further to add than whats inherent in the guidance other than the decline in legacy wireless were expecting a seasonal for the remainder of our revenue microanalysis of the and linearity of revenue or linearity of order frankly there nothing to be gained there what mean by is we had a typical profile on both order and revenue declined around Chinese New Year a we do every and then it recovered and bounced back again in the of nothing unique in the profile compared with what we would typically expect in a for your question go next to with What are you planning on doing with the factory loading in and any thought on the factory loading at this point for the back half a it relates to loading with the increased outlook we have we would expect the factory loading to be higher in than they were in consequently utilization charge in all likelihood decline quarteroverquarter expect the utilization which about of underutilization charge in the which down about from the decline further a we go into on the back of increased factory loading Do you have a followon you have of taken to using the trend line analysis to about the industry and underscore even though we exactly when thing are to recover it a way to highlight how much were undershipping sort of what a longterm is the of conventional bear case on is a longterm demand is broken now and trend line a lot of u using including you isnt relevant anymore what do you to folk when they longterm trend line is broken and therefore analysis isnt relevant recently were trying to avoid discussion what mean by is we have no unique insight to provide in term of where we are with respect to trend line where we are with respect to the cycle so frankly were head down focusing on trying to gain share in and Embedded Processing regardless of the market environment and be able to generate cash flow at the to of revenue we described well leave it to you expert to try to figure out where we are relative to those trend and relative to any cycle consideration you for your question go next to is on another one on order trend it seems after this the Wireless part of your baseband ph be much de minimis if we continue in the sort of normal seasonal slog can you u what normal seasonality is there be or could there be any more depression on your overall sale from Wireless in well mean were saying so in saying the Wireless legacy Wireless decline to roughly about compared with in there still to unwind through the remainder of the the answer is yes it likely continue to be a bit of a headwind but quantified it get smaller and smaller a every pass by which mean the end is near on term of our historical average is about and again Ill put the same caveat on it we always do there a wide about average our case it minus to plus so but the average is in fact Do you have a followon you give u your expectation on the relative growth rate for either your main product line or end market for the rest of the at least give u the status of those would we would expect at least for our segment were likely to grow at least at the market rate because we have been successful at consistently gaining market share for the last or year in each of our target segment of and Embedded Processing would expect we should be able to turn in maybe growth a bit beyond what the total market itself grows Beyond a mentioned a moment were a bit hesitant to go off and articulate we had some of expertise or special insight a to the market growth or the economy a a whole Instead we remain focused on growing share and converting revenue growth into cash flow targeted to turned in for the last month and in a weak market with in mind were encouraged a to what this portfolio can do for our shareholder you for question go next to with guess a Wireless legacy go to what would you expect the profitably to be in the other bucket Is the intent to try to get to breakeven a revenue go away or how should about would would be profitable a Wireless go to on it way down it delivering much no profit because were taking out cost at about the same rate the profit dollar are coming out keep in mind what else is in there have our DLP technology in there we have our custom ASIC in there we have our calculator in there and we have our royalty in there each of those are relatively low RD relatively low SGA type of business so they generate reasonably high margin and attractive cash the only be dragging it down on a goforward recall we also take we put the acquisitionrelated charge into which run around a we also put restructuring charge into which this about and should run about same for the next of quarter Do you have a followon quickly a a followon housekeeping Did you give an absolute booking number you spent about buying back stock in the but share count of flat you help me understand stock price driving more option in the money and dilution or there something else on on the booking order were in the up and resulted in a booktobill ratio of already it positive but it and compare to in the me add an additional note maybe or asterisk to the booktobill Keep in mind we now have of our total revenue on consignment consignment by definition run a booktobill for the additional of our revenue not on consignment for the total to net out to obviously the nonconsignment revenue ran well above booktobill obviously we have a booktobill fully supportive of the revenue we have forecast for the next you want to handle the back part of the on the of the stock count relatively flat this and in the face of the fact repurchased worth of share there are thing on there the increase in stock price and the natural pending expiration of certain stock option there an increase in stock option exercise across the employee base and of course put share back into the market the same stock price increased the dilutive share count those element combined basically held the share count about even in the for your question go next to with Had a on the trajectory of OpEx your new RD guide reply something exiting the at a run rate of maybe Is accurate you give u some idea of guess what the trajectory of OpEx through the look and how sustainable run rate exiting the is to be Do you expect to grow a revenue grow so to help everybody else get to similar conclusion there guided RD to spent about this you can of get to what the balance of the quarter would point out on the Wireless restructuring we mentioned were well on our way to the in annualized saving the best way to see is to take a at at and of compare with where were at you can see the effect on the RD line a we begin to unwind the Wireless about halfway through more than halfway through the saving and the RD a it relates to the Wireless restructuring so keep on so the of math using when you get to end from a seasonal isnt too far off from what we might expect by the we get there clearly well have such thing a pay and benefit increase and so on on a yearoveryear and well bump back up a we move into but expect to be all much in relation to the total cost saving we have similar phenomenon on SGA is likely to occur although not nearly at the same magnitude the biggest spend in the Wireless restructuring in the RD cost category do you have a followon do wanted to poke into the Embedded Processing margin a bit get the idea allocating more corporate cost around the around the other business this case so you also lumped in guess the Wireless Embedded wanted to clarify your plan is have at a roughly breakeven OpEx right now for the Wireless piece you give u number one is accurate If it not can you tell u what guess the OpEx burden of look finally how big Embedded Processing actually need to get now before you can start driving margin guess at historical level in Are we are you finished increasing the investment level there Do we have all we need Ill go ahead and answer if miss something maybe can speak up also What we talked about the Embedded Processing technology of OMAP and Connectivity when operated at about breakeven Keep in mind the portion we move from Wireless be added to a portion the OMAP portion already serving the Embedded space in the form of the automotive market already the Embedded Processing when we at those and combine those they are at about breakeven on a combined wont go into detail a to what their OpEx level are but suffice it to theyre at about breakeven on a combined a goforward to your a to what should we expect from Embedded Processing would characterize the of the of investment to no longer require addition of the been doing in the of year are at a point now where we are spending at sufficient level to invest in product development now it all about growing the revenue to begin to absorb the cost are already at this point and a you saw in this did grow it grown not only on a quarteroverquarter but yearoveryear so would expect we would continue to see some good thing out of you for your question go next to with Capital wanted to followup on the trajectory of the OpEx cut mean should we about it fairly linear on the RD side then can you u what the target is on the SGA you thought you could bring it down a bit but it it still get back to where your target is not what talking about on target per se would broadly speaking we have talked about OpEx a a collective cost category to fluctuate between and of our revenue where on a weak cycle which were coming out of right now we would expect to be at the upper end of pushing the in fact in it exactly of our revenue our revenue strengthen we would expect OpEx to work it way down a a percentage of revenue in a strong market get down to the of a goforward there is still cost to out a mentioned a few moment especially out of the RD line Do recall when we talked about the cost saving we expected from the Wireless restructuring annualized by the end of the roughly of is to out of RD roughly of out of SGA and the balance would out of cost to revenue we would expect to see a bit more lift out of the SGA a we get later in the largely this is a timing of the action certain of our sight around the world affect when we see those benefit begin to through the PL Right would add if you compare where we were in with RD compared with of last before we initiated the Wireless restructuring youll see we are well ahead of linearity in term of the reduction being linear assumption from now through the rest of the over the next quarter is about the best you could do end result likely wont be fully linear but about a good a we could get should were still there is some work were doing with the Works Council in Europe could affect the timing of the activity there is certainly some uncertainty there in term of the exact profile were well on track to achieve the saving and well get the remainder out whether it linear or sooner or low or slower well leave to report it a it happens Do you have a followon Capital then on the dropthrough of margin in the guidance it seems a bit below your target Is calculator or if you can about the different moving piece on margin not what saying a bit below our target did about during through the course of the cycle we would expect fallthrough delta revenue to fall through the GPM would be through the course of the cycle based upon our historical experience fact good fallthrough happening right now if you do the math on revenue we turned in we up on the midpoint of the guidance we gave we some reasonable fallthrough on in fact if you take a at it it actually make quite a bit of in the context of thing mix improvement a Wireless is coming out and so and Embedded Processing become a larger portion of our revenue a mentioned earlier in the call the benefit of the fact our factory loading be up on expectation of higher revenue in so have a favorable benefit to our utilization charge would we get down to those individual line in term of your model charge in be similar to where they were in the Most of the acquisition charge line is the amortization of acquisition and stay stable for a of restructuring a we continue our work to close those older factory the one in Houston the one in Hiji Japan which take through or the facility close in half of of this we have a more quarter where the restructuring charge be similar to what you saw in so if you take if taken if you add to it to the guidance we provided on RD you should find your growth your incremental margin be very similar to what we described a the historical or above a you continue to scrub youll get a refined answer right you go next to with wonder if you can give u and within the some end market color on computing wireless infrastructure auto industrial Did any market particularly stand out either in or in term of the guidance certainly can do but Ill have to do it for overall give those input collected by but Ill make these discussion maybe a we go through industrial which affect both Embedded Processing a well a and we noted specifically SVA a well a High Performance were seeing strength mostly driven by the and China Europe and Japan both continue to be subdued there have to it everything else the customer are operating more or le handtomouth Theyre not giving a lot of extended visibility but demand there overall is clearly rising Also a we noted were seeing strength in automotive Most of is being driven by the market Probably the weakest on front would be in Japan then for the we would expect to see China start to build on the strength for a well we in the computing market specifically we continue to see weakness in the market being driven we believe by likely by additional cannibalization of tablet and smartphones well see where go but market remains weak Consumer would describe a mixed Areas gaming are weak TV sale would overall remain weak but vary by OEM with the Japanese OEMs the one are giving up the most in term of market share handset or mobile communication even a we talked about in the midquarter update we saw overall a stronger than what we had expected there varies significantly by OEM overall did a better for u but not uniformly across customer go across again a lot of different product both the legacy but it also some of the product in we sell into the handset space then finally comms infrastructure remains weak for u in along the line of what we described in the midquarter update is continuing to be driven by constrained operator spending believe there an inventory inventory sorry we believe there an inventory issue believe inventory in space generally remain low but operator have not picked up their spending guess if were to summarize at least a it applies to we saw the area and we saw the comms infrastructure area both below our expectation coming into the and what we would describe or characterize a weak the flip side industrial strong better than we had expected Automotive strong better than we had expected then some of the mobile handset market also were you and well move to your then within the Wireless the stuff for you is discontinued it a bit stronger than we thought both in and wonder if you could address could tail be longer in the back half is there sort of a finite life for the next generation of those product come in and you have a steeper decline believe we have product line wrapped up by the end of the we have not changed our expectation from the standpoint of the endpoint there obviously there always some put and take there it we still expect by the end of the revenue essentially be gone for your question move next to with of one more on OpEx me try it a different way If my model is right in the last year your SGA been consistently below your RD expense when compare you to more of the pureplay Analogs ADI Linear theyre SGA expense is to below their RD expense understand there are some nearterm issue you have to take care of but what be the trigger for you to lower SGA below the RD expense a your model becomes closer to what we would of a a pureplay embedded supplier to at our history isnt a good predictor because our history a big chunk of wireless in it for an extended of with a substantial RD build would offer to you would distort any historical analysis of a a starting point Beyond perhaps the biggest to be different between and other and Embedded Processing player or potentially different is the fact we had made a conscious decision and we made it a number of year to have a significantly larger sale force than any of our competitor on the back of the fact we have a significantly larger catalog of product than any of our competitor and therefore there a lot more to be sold the result of of course a we have been we have actually been able to achieve market share from our competitor over the last few year on the back of a larger portfolio of product and a larger sale force all being to there is no intent to go off and do some of significant readjustment to the size of our SGA bucket fact it a conscious effort on our part to make we have the world largest sale force be some cost coming out of the SGA a we wind down the last of the Wireless site specifically the one in Europe talking about earlier and subject to finalizing our discussion with the Works Council in Europe Once complete we would expect the SGA to support site would out of our cost and take our SGA level down a bit but it achieve the of ratio you are alluding to there Do you have a followon is on margin and capacity utilization your mix start to improve are you still comfortable with the fallthrough to margin What are the put and take in when you acquired all the capacity understand the cash cost a bit but when you acquired all capacity global growth expectation already different than what they are right now what of check do you have in place to make you are able to utilize all the capacity so it doesnt become a drag on margin in some reasonable of the next whatever year counted maybe a question in there so me see if can remember them all the fallthrough we remain comfortable with what we talked about only by virtue of the fact what our history shown u is through the course of the cycle up and down we average fallthrough on the delta revenue Interestingly enough in any one you practically never see fallthrough across the cycle youll see we see any reason why the future would be different than what history shown u for a number of cycle wouldnt expect to change in light of the fact well begin to increase our utilization to how much capacity are we comfortable with once again the utilization charge we about here in fact a lot of is noncash talked for several quarter in a row now it half or le is to be cash related and the rest is noncash cash is extremely important because obviously result in cash flow for our shareholder which believe when we to them most of them it quite important in the context of u being able to provide them with dividend and ongoing stock buyback we remain focused on the benefit of the cash flow this strategy employ for u a opposed to trying to make adjustment solely for the benefit of a GPM percent calculation may or may not benefit cash flow with being there are no plan other than what already announced for changing the size of our installed manufacturing capacity those plan already announced well the one we announced year and is the closure of an old small factory we have in Hiji Japan and the closure of an old factory we have in Houston both of which be closed in the half of this or by the half of this interestingly when we to our large shareholder which most of which are very longterm in their investment horizon they describe the idea of buying capacity on the cheap for penny on the dollar and holding it even if it a number of year until we need it a a nobrainer in fact reflects their own investment style with stock again we feel we are very well aligned with our largest shareholder in term of strategy and we well continue to deliver good return with strategy you for your question go next to of the underutilization charge you mentioned it you in this last way to give u a clue on what revenue those underutilization charge disappear fully realize it more about utilization than revenue to simplify it any answer on front be helpful cant give you a number on because it a mix of the optimal loading in all the various factory we have around the world we have more than factory around the world so have a precise answer for you a foot way of thinking about it is we have characterized we believe we have enough installed capacity to support something approaching of revenue so in theory if we went to utilization on we clearly do not have an underutilization charge at revenue fact underutilization charge never assume you get to utilization They assume you get to something le than again varies by factory and have a precise answer for you on Nice try Do you have a followon maybe Ill get a closer with this one Similar to the prior on when is SGA to go down actually if flip around at your peer group the RD a a percentage of sale for most of your peer is significantly higher than where it seems you are to be exiting this Again you have the Other you have to utilize a much but do you you can keep the share gain at whatever pace they have been with RD a a percentage of sale being so much below your peer group be cautious on the analysis doing of course with the segment we reveal only the revenue and the operating profit or PFO fact when trying to do your RD analysis doing it at the you the comment made earlier on the call the of RD we spend in the Other is very very low so in fact the proportion being spent in and EP is a higher mathematically than what getting at the the meantime again we have over product we sell them to over customer actually we have plenty of opportunity to continue selling those product even more of those product to the same customer a well a new product to the same customer or new customer were not worried about the RD spend being able to give u expansion to our portfolio quite confident with where were at would add keep in mind the reduction were doing are a a result almost wholly due to the Wireless restructuring not not Embedded Processing so were spending at comparable level in those segment the and Embedded Processing than we have in our result in the translating to market share gain there any issue with our spending with our portfolio expansion Ill give an example in Embedded Processing we took the number of product we have in our portfolio up by a reasonably significant expansion in a single and reflects whats a aggressive RD spend there believe your followup go next to with of Montréal Capital you did go through the end market breakdown had a trying to reconcile the industrial strength you saw and you seem to be seeing with had a of big and harbinger of market GE a well a this morning Caterpillar out and sort of have a very cautionary tone in your opinion and looking back is of factored in with the inventory being low and so you continue to see market strengthening it take a longer for to filter through the order book can correlate what were seeing to what those are describing mean frankly we sell a lot of semiconductor to Caterpillar mean to diminish they may be reflecting something on at a broader macro but a lot of what were seeing in industrial is almost the same type of trend you see in automobile Automobile unit sale can be flat and we still have a nice growth opportunity because of the rapid penetration increased penetration of semiconductor in those market you go into other industrial market lighting and the rapid escalation of LED lighting versus CFL or incandescent can tell you we have a much higher semiconductor content in LED lighting than we do in the prior generation an example mean you can go across smart thermostat compared to the old electromechanical you can find one after the other where were now selling significant semiconductor content into those industrial market where historically we sold very not giving up hope were to turn Caterpillar into a huge customer someday again not here and now were thing can always change but were confident in term of what we are seeing with our own Do you have a followon Capital do hope you can sell a lot more content into those GE turbine ph a well followup is on SVA Last it of went in line with the core and this it up you please give u some qualitative measure or quantitative a to how SVA is performing it early in the turnaround but also where are you with the consignment SVA is through Theres a thing to about SVA the last of quarter have been very encouraging in term of the relative performance of SVA compared to the rest of our been compared to the other business we have it right at the top over the period Now those are only quarter out of a but keep in mind our expectation for a or SVA move up to market growth meaning we lose market share through those business but we expect it would lag the remainder of our business where they have been gaining share historically good result for the last quarter still a lot of work to be done not putting a fork in it yet but it feeling good thus far Status of consignment is a we described back in we expect we had a total of basically to convert over to consignment done about of in each of the last quarter so were about of the way through our expectation is for the remaining it take more quarter to get through consignment changeover completely of the way through to go over the next quarter you go to with you about linearity but can you at least a bit about what the put and take are for your guidance Oh not mean there are so many variable any one of which can affect whether thing are up or down suffice to it hard enough to get the total right without trying to go public on all of the individual assumption obviously we at it at detail but in term of our public guidance and comment well keep it at the total have a followon easy is for Youre guiding for CapEx to be you spent should we model steep increase in the half if so whats for were holding to on the CapEx forecast we expect most of be for wafer fab equipment with sorry ph for assembly test operation with the balance for wafer fab equipment a of making enough capacity for the volume were actually producing Keep in mind at there there a bit of capacity expansion but to a large extent it line rebalancing and making thing are a the demand on certain flow change we can rebalance the line to handle those demand comfortable we remain CapEx forecast this at you at this point well give you back a minute of your you for joining u of this call is on our you our may now',\n",
       "       'take our from with had a wanted to dig into the order trajectory a bit your last earnings call you had guess order had bottomed in and on a sequential looking better you give u some feeling how trend is it moved through and even through the bit in so far me in general the stronger demand environment we discussed back in continued through the and overall is tracking better than our initial expectation we see this in our revenue trend and even more so in our order a we are now building backlog for the in several quarter would quartertodate order have been growing strongly and turn level have been high a were able to support our customer with short lead time also our good inventory position clearly is contributing to a noted were building backlog would note given the high turn visibility remains low but we have no reason to believe the strength thus far not continue a we go Do you have a followon do If you could give u a bit of color on where the strength is coming from or at least area might be stronger or weaker versus your initial expectation this apply to both about order and revenue but specifically looking at revenue when came up with these would the strength is most notable in the industrial market a youll note where we have a strong presence with product specifically our High Performance and our Silicon Valley business the flip side we see continued weakness in some of the vertical market such a notebook computer and communication infrastructure Ill also note handset and tablet are up overall compared with our initial expectation also note result there vary by customer you next come from with a followup to the last answer you gave handset and tablet commentary do you still your guidance still encompass a sequential drop in your Wireless a good guess what would is we expect our Wireless revenue still to decline sharply this although Wireless some strengthening a well a these other area noted the decline would be le than the we called out in our call but have a updated number for you at this point Do you have a followon on the OpEx side of thing in a general you talked about in saving from exiting the Wireless should we in general about the slope of reduction a well a how the core OpEx within is likely to trend relative to revenue a a reminder what we back in guess when we announced Wireless restructuring we noted we would expect of saving by the end of cant move exactly linear but have a profile for you either What would is we also have the revenue and the associated profit with revenue declining sharply a well guess what would is the net effect of it all by the end of the the loss our Wireless incurring we would expect it be essentially offset via both the winddown of revenue a well a the restructuring cost saving have a quarterbyquarter breakout for you you with our next can you u what normal seasonality is for a quick clarification so are you saying your book to bill is above so far this Normal seasonality in is about is upper single digit clearly something in general would you it a or seasonally strong for both our semiconductor chip shipment a well a for our calculator calculator alone typically contribute to point of companylevel sequential growth with it what often is a doubling of it revenue between the and the again seasonally is our strongest have a forecast for you provide in were clearly expecting growth in the ahead To your on book to bill guess would again reiterate order are strong Ive were building backlog for the in several quarter guess by definition if were building backlog then implies the book to bill is above well have a number for you a usual in Do you have a followon between the area of strength guess if we take industrial versus handsetstablets Are either of those contributing more strength or more upside in term of revenue are they both about the same Theyre not both the same but want to get into at this point trying to break out the difference there Ill both industrial and the handsettablet space are up well give more detail in you with term of the better demand do you have a of how much of is an endmarket improvement versus some inventory restocking on the part of the customer from the low ph level what would is it tends to be a before the order were seeing is a lot of of inquarter turn type activity our is the customer are still running lean on the inventory front Theyre not committing to a lot of extended backlog lead time the majority of product are under week delivering well to schedule and customer are leaning on u accordingly again my so guess would would the end result of would be yes it reflecting indemand a opposed to inventory build a aware it difficult for u to with much precision exactly whats on other than of the highlevel turn activity to me would reflect more indemand a opposed to or at least preparation for a higher of indemand Do you have a followon please If could on the factory utilization Anything you could quantify from u heard from some of your sort of tangential competitor about what of increase in factory utilization they might be seeing anything you could maybe tell u about or plan about factory loading setting into to help u about margin leverage thatd be great would in fact we have increased production start this to support the higher of anticipated demand we have for the only you have to be cautious about when you try to translate to a margin impact is there is some lag again we can start an extra wafer and wont necessarily impact utilization all through the line over the course of a we continue to increase production start lift utilization with caveat you well take our next from with Capital apologize for the background noise one on the on the overall indemand environment please help u contrast with head fake versus sustainable recovery what can you point to u and this look a more sustainable than the head fake we had last we can perfectly again what we are encouraged by is when we through our distribution channel and we at customer we generally see lean level of inventory and therefore a quick readthrough from change in indemand to our own or demand for our own product a you pointed out before sometimes these thing happen and it translates to a fullblown cycle other case it a head fake a described cant provide perfect certainty other than again were preparing in term of our factory utilization in term of our inventory position to support a growing demand environment Do you have a followon Capital and is helpful the followup is on the comp ph side Xilinx and indiscernible were more bullish about the comp ph than in the turning What have you specifically when you you continue to see weakness what were not seeing which is not increased demand from of the market again the FPGA player tend to play much more concentrated at the very leading edge of wireless infrastructure equipment play there also but we also play much more broadly than they do can sit there and compare and contrast and explain what theyre saying versus what were seeing we are confident in our designin position across the of base station equipment have not yet it lift could potentially even be difference in lead for those player versus Again our lead time generally are short heard through our customer base and this is not necessarily a communication infrastructurespecific note but heard more broadly through our customer base several of our customer are in the process of extending lead time are not in the position where we have to do of course could reflect in timing of when certain competitor or certain other supplier might see increased demand versus when we might see it all see it in the end with Capital Capital the better strength in are all your segment still down then maybe you could comment on the computing whether you see a build how we should at the seasonality new platform are coming in the back half Are you seeing the channel clean when we see start a seasonal build there the me ask for a clarification What your on the seasonal build for it to an end market Capital Computing Computing Capital Are all segment still down with the strength in then could you comment on the computing end channel seems to be solely accretive ph computing thought you competing Embedded Processing and Other all of those segment we expect to be down we described somewhat in were in the process of aligning ph our financial reporting structure to our new organization Wireless been eliminated and the legacy wireless product be included in the Other and is the biggest factor in the Other segment sequential decline get more information for you on the various segment and some of their historical trend within the next of week a we noted back in be down Embedded Processing we would expect be down slightly then Other be down again consistent with our initial expectation in the all of those would be down le than what we had expected back in Did you have a followon on when we expect computing to be lifting can we would have expected stronger from computing already computing is actually running weaker than we had expected back in a is the communication infrastructure Do you have a followon Capital in the strength seeing in wireless seems your customer there new platform on and assuming where a lot of the strength is coming from talked about Wireless of fading for you by the end of the this customer continue to build on your product how do you see the trajectory with your connectivity product not a customer still a breadth of customer were engaged with in Wireless it different a Ive before different result from different customer do expect it to continue down a it down sharply even in not it not down a much a we had expected a lot of sequential decline from to part of it is tied to the winddown of those product line part of it is the seasonal trend within those customer guess Ill leave it at you with back in the utilization charge would be about the same in versus Does still hold now with the nice improvement in booking have taken our production start up a more than what we had expected back in and you could see some impact in general Kevins statement still hold which is the underutilization charge in roughly would be about the same a what we would expect in maybe a small improvement from do you have a followon on the distribution channel obviously if industrial is driving the strength assume DSPs are doing quite well for you hoping you could qualitatively a bit about what theyre seeing especially in relation to their sellthrough on your product distribution sale or resale from distributor or their sellthrough decline about the same a our revenue overall theyre tracking closely with an inventory standpoint interestingly distribution inventory owned by those distributor decline is a function of them relying more heavily on consignment inventory from we at the combination of what they own and what we have in place for them on consignment inventory is at about the same a it at the end of the again what they own what they have on their balance sheet actually go down this which say is a successful program with had for you the industrial piece of the seems to be strong Is it fair to assume a your a the benefit of higher production start through margin in the incremental fallthrough is higher than the typically you about versus average cycle in the over the course of the cycle is the right number whether it happens in any particular or not a lot of different factor including the amount utilization charge or the le or more charge Whether your cycle up or down fall through in this case would is still a good general number to use by but it always varies somewhat it also could be the effect being delayed by a in term of the underutilization impact versus did it go away is it higher or lower in a particular well give you some more guidance on once we get into Do you have a followon a quick housekeeping item you update u on exactly what percentage of is industrial Hang on a me pull out the pull up for you thought had it here industrial is right at below Sometimes and me be clear because different people at different thing in term of what they include in industrial the very call it broadbased type of industrial is Separately and not included in is automotive which is of our revenue then education which is our calculator product run about but what believe you would typically consider industrial would call with automotive above and beyond amount for your question continue on to with slightly betterthanexpected strength seeing Is this a constant high are you actually seeing momentum grow each week each is a bit better than the last leading to the upside it varies somewhat because keep in mind we had Chinese New Year in the of so we had a very strong fell back a bit a you would expect for Chinese New Year then a we moved through it came back very strong again it doing it not this nice smooth profile where you can at the derivative and it or Y it is doing what you would expect in term of a what Ill call an improving market environment you have to allow Chinese New Year within there a well Do you have a followon a quick one the upside is it both in term of your sale related to distribution a well a the sale are directly to end customer and manufacturer is it more weighted to one or the other it both being industrial tends to move heavily through distribution clearly channel is an important one for u right now with the industrial exposure a the handset space is running better than expected a well a lot of not all but a lot of tends to be direct you with and is Josh Shanker ph on behalf of and have a on the rate guidance want to understand is this a function of overall end market is it every other semi is seeing this of uplift is it because you have guided a bit more conservative than peer and you are increasing your guidance a Ive indicated industrial is a big part of the strengthening environment is if somebody else guided more aggressively versus then they may not see a much lift a were seeing versus those expectation given the broad base of the industrial market anybody a player in space is to see an improving environment again at an absolute forget guidance whether it conservative or aggressive environment is showing very clear sign of improvement Do you have a followon on the industrial market so if you at the indiscernible data the overall the ASP down over the to quarter and it seems mostly it due to the weakness in industrial do you see mean the industrial picked ph up in but do you see continuing on over the rest of the Ive indicated we expect growth to continue into Ive stuck my neck out far enough with forecast about and a we get closer to those quarter have any comment or forecast for for your question me before we end the call me you the is on our you and good you again lady and gentleman today call you all for your',\n",
       "       'go to our with Capital Capital very detailed and comprehensive and then have a followup a well please we you mentioned you were talking about the model transitioned and you to the Embedded and the now shining through the part we the transition happened What give you the confidence about the shining through part Is it based on the organic getting design win or National doing better please help u understand part and had a quick followup it the combination of the Organically we have been growing and gaining market share now for a number of year quite apparent when you at the market data addition we have the additional leverage from the Silicon Valley or the National acquisition Recall when we talked about the acquisition we expected during the they would unit would continue to lose share a it had been doing prior to when we acquired them During the which were now into they would stabilize from a share standpoint then by the wed expect it to start gaining share consistent with the other division we operate so combined we at and expect to continue to gain share for u which mean even if the market growth rate is unpredictable our ability to grow market is fully in our control Similar in Embedded Processing you may recall we stepped up our investment in Embedded Processing especially on engineering and our sale on field staffing about year now it take several year for those type of stepup in investment to begin to yield result and we would expect to see begin to it been growing nicely and gaining share but we expect to see it continue to grow quite nicely and gain share and move Do you have a followup Capital followup on the buyback should we be thinking about the you have been doing the last year then also what of stock do you feel your stock is undervalued me start with the one obviously have been actively buying our share for a long now mean a you saw from chart we reduced our share count by since amount we allocate to stock buyback is the formula is clearly straightforward take a at our prior year cash flow the average cash flow allocate half of cash flow for dividend use the balance for paying down debt a it come due and buying back share the of stock buyback activity u do here recently is reflective of what we can expect to the valuation would simply we believe the valuation opportunity for is substantially above what it currently is a our strategy unfolds in the next few year we move now to with following up on your last statement you provide u the parameter you use in calculating the DCF you talked about on Slide it classic school calculation in we at the current value of the a it relates to our asset base and our cash flow generation capability over and we discount back at our weighted average cost to capital Nothing unique there then other had you talked about in the CMOS process to outsource below nanometer but and obviously recognize is not at node but do you anticipate eventually get below if it is something you intend to do inhouse then related to you also mentioned you want to have a certain amount of tool installed ahead of demand Is dependent on the availability of cheap tool always been very good at buying tool from bankrupt company are you willing to buy new tool if you need to the tool Ill answer one Ill take a poke at the on the other part of your the tool were looking there quite frankly when you buy it before you need it you actually have to pay full price whether a relatively new tool or a used tool quite simply the essence of the strategy here is to purchase it when you need it and you can wait until the price is attractive wed prefer to buy the tool when theyre distressed when certain competitor in the industry find it necessary to get rid of those tool the most attractive pricing opportunity again our strategy is to buy well before we need it so were not subjected to if you the catalog price at the we do need it do you want to comment on the indiscernible if you our total number or percentage of wafer are outsourced is around again nanometer and below outsourced for advanced CMOS a our Wireless unwinds obviously percentage decrease and the percentage we build inhouse increase since essentially all of the Wireless is built outside if you at where is there actually a small portion of the wafer built at nanometer have some newer process technology at nanometer most everything in is or above you for most technology and most application you it not a Moores Law gain and hence one of the reason why we can purchase more mature manufacturing asset and keep them employed for decade and well go to the next we now take a next from with of realize you have a midquarter update coming up soon but can you give u your of what the state of the industry is right now many of your peer have called for a bottom what Ive is over the last year it been a relatively easy call to call a bottom in but then the visibility tended to be limited after understand you want to be TIspecific but how do you see the state of the industry Do you see visibility improving anything improving or is it still very shortterm focused right now give more color in a week on our midquarter update a to what our current thinking is certainly in the near which is always on people mind do recall we had given a expected our revenue would decline slightly in the versus the then seasonally if you we typically see the industry and included seeing sequential growth in the Right now see anything could comment on would cause u to expect anything different than what history taught u to expect and well give more color on a bit later when we get closer to our midquarter update is scheduled for do you have a followup Second you mentioned you are largely done with your restructuring action we hear very frequently from investor is what is baseline earnings model ie what is your target model for growth and operating margin now done with all the restructuring action how should we about those particular metric so we can start forming a longterm earnings model for the the way to about this is consistent with our capital management strategy we articulated and is were focused on not growing the top line but generating and returning cash to our shareholder while our and operating margin by themselves are important metric they necessarily prove an enterprise ability to actually generate cash flow can give return to shareholder other important factor need to be considered also are the company tax policy and the company capital expenditure need being our mix continues to improve because and Embedded Processing continue to become a bigger part of our revenue a Wireless decline Combined should support all of these metric improving and giving u better ability to generate cash for our shareholder again the value shareholder find is not only the potential appreciation value of the stock price itself if you but also the fact we continue to return our cash in the form of dividend and stock buyback you historically we are in a growth phase our incremental margin tend to fall through about over the course of the cycle if hopefully helpful to your well go to the next please take our next from of a lot of what you straightforward If you at your historic buyback and sort of the return on buyback it would appear the core generates a significantly higher return than the buyback of why not have a greater focus on top line growth through MA especially given over the last year core of had a negative CAGR it been a hard industry a difficult industry environment but can you help me understand why not more emphasis on top line growth plenty of emphasis on top line growth and take some issue with the core having negative CAGR because in fact if you total would be true when you work in the effect of the wind down of the Wireless over the last year fact the organic area been investing in those in fact have been growing quite nicely for multiple year now To support growth you asked the about acquisition in fact a all well aware we did a very large acquisition about year frankly those for u along once every decade or so To the extent we use acquisition to continue to support our objective in the future expect those are to be small acquisition certainly for the foreseeable future this is my followup the mix between buyback and dividend especially a dividend of over the last year average cash flow anything magical about target or what the sort of the rationale behind target Quite frankly we it a strong signal to our investor you can expect a constant stream of income from in the form of dividend and at a average cash flow over the last year give u ample headroom if you to ensure dividend would be uninterrupted certainly the other side of program it can be flexed if it need to be you well go to the next please move now to with and is Ken for Question on the capacity had talked about opportunistically acquiring capacity you help me understand the rationale between at up to in revenue when you would acquire capacity and of the rationale behind have a followup Ken talked about before current installed capacity endtoend so both wafer fab capacity and assembly test capacity to support revenue up to a you saw last we were able to put capacity in place and yet last spend le than of our revenue line on CapEx a we and especially in area millimeter tool there are some of those tool become on the market fairly infrequently if the opportunity present itself to acquire equipment for penny on the dollar we have in the we want to take advantage of opportunity and begin to extend from where it is we expect to be able to do and actually have made some acquisition even here more recently and still do of our current CapEx guidance and therefore continue to run at for the foreseeable future do you have a followup the share repurchase is there an expiration on also how do we about the run rate in term of repurchase you had talked about in the near you are to of be at the pace you have been the last of quarter What are the primer on whether you would accelerate or decelerate Ken there is no expiration on the repurchase a budget the allocates to management to deploy for these purpose so our present budget is a you noted we have talked the share repurchase activity in the few quarter representative of what you can expect leave it at expect a significant change one way or the other in the size of share repurchase for the foreseeable future next come from with talking about returning of cash flow le debt repayment but it sound you are prioritizing cash flow over debt repayment about in debt maturing in have about maturing every of What is your thinking around in particular sort of shortterm tranche coming due in a few month in term of paying them Should we expect to be refinanced certainly at today interest rate it remains very attractive to be looking at rolling over the debt may recall we initially took out the debt to acquire National Semiconductor had intended to pay the we paid the debt a it came due in fact a we came into the middle of last we were seeing interest rate continue to be at historically low level and we decided it made economic for u to go ahead and simply take on debt to capture those level a function of what were talking about here it make economic well go ahead and roll over debt to take advantage of these kind of interest rate the metric were using is if we can capture interest rate are even below expected inflation or below our dividend yield then it seems an attractive and accretive decision on behalf of our shareholder and a safe decision on behalf of our bond holder because were quite capable of repaying it a long a we continue to see very attractive interest rate you can expect we make some allocation to rollover Got it helpful for my followup a on the tax strategy want to make have the math right showing your sort of guess this is your blended tax rate a a function of revenue Is it making the assumption a revenue grow repatriating more cash at and so the tax rate on this go up Are you doing something else around the tax strategy to minimize tax Theres a of element affect the tax strategy example we enjoy a advance pricing agreement with the IRS help u to have a more predictable expectation a to intercompany pricing and very important to your tax strategy and tax rate we negotiated a deal with them recently What model assumes is the incremental profit is taxed at the current statutory rate of the current tax law remains in effect Quite simply how to forecast a change in the tax law so if you tax each incremental dollar of profit at you fall through with those kind of rate you see in the sample model gave well go to the next please the next is from with this capital management process been on for a while mean the model been obviously improving your cash flow every wondering why now why sort of communicate all this now mean is there more confidence in the model Is it because exiting OMAP trying to understand the timing it a combination of those thing the fact the Wireless is winding down and the cash call on technology is away it the fact were now at more than of our revenue coming from and Embedded Processing which are much more stable and reliable generator of cash so we have reached point in the transition of the where we it make to go ahead and clearly articulate to our stockholder what our capital management strategy is and the fact they can count on u returning of our cash flow minus any debt repayment we engage in very fair a a followup when we about working capital and the inventory model being to day wondering if change once you move even more of your to consignment or should we still assume to day comprehends move to consignment me give a bit more background on ended last at day Keep in mind were still winding down the legacy Wireless product so obviously we want any more inventory on those product we absolutely need also in the process of on our SVA product line a a result of bringing division on to our system in the begun the process of migrating their product their distributionrelated inventory to our consignment model to day comprehends this full transition if you Over we would expect to be closer to a we go into the future go now to with BRiley Question asked and answered but appreciate the unique helpful presentation you next please the next is with one have remaining is regarding your capital structure and the leverage have a bit of debt outstanding the consistency of your cash flow could in fact support a more levered balance sheet and would clearly be good for equity wonder what management thought are on it a good a fine balance we have here a company ability to or their capacity for debt is somewhat a function of their credit rating our case we have a credit rating of which is a very strong credit rating we actually credit rating provides very important care abouts to investor is it show were a strong is committed to and able to pay it obligation those obligation would be interest and debt repayment to debt holder and dividend obligation to our stockholder while theoretically it is possible to leverage the balance sheet more it would be at the expense of lowering our credit rating we happen to with a of our size and our global ambition this is the right balance and the right mix to be at this credit rating and to manage our debt rate of capacity and not exceed capacity simply the plan we put together and how we intend to operate the next is Schwartzman with Seix Advisors Schwartzman you answered my Earlier in the call you had mentioned you paying your debt down because you then had the ability to flex your balance sheet to ask all within the current rating your answer yes but correct well go ahead and our call you for joining u of this call is from our day Ladies and gentleman today Once again we everyone for joining u',\n",
       "       'absolutely thought maybe wed start off with some of big picture thing and then of drill into some of the thing obviously one on a lot of folk mind you being one of the biggest and broadest company in the industry can bring some perspective to is of where your thought are on where we are in the semi cycle a we stand and then well of break it down from there Ive had a chance for the of week talked to investor and you end up on almost theme of one we had indiscernible coming up the earnings call all felt about the same company used slightly different term we all watched and of being down but you watched being better and even when we reported in we talked about to point being better then go to of the part of is now gone quarter where after what some people would call a classic semiconductor cycle in late early and then strong quarter been down up down up down a pattern havent in all my year my modified view on is starting to be it not what have the year been but much more whats it been since we basically had somewhat a flat nondirectional macro economy yes we have an over adjustment in early and it reacted the other way but then a indifferent of purposing of the demand since then a a result of people were Geez is the semi cycle gone forever doubt it human are still human the good news at is were however this want to play out of where we see it right now and where thing are you mentioned during the earnings call different company of put some different wrapper around it but at the end of the day there a reasonably broadbased view there an improvement in continued into and then some of the company have reported even in since have continued and certainly heard here at the Different company have cited different reason for Some people have cited removal of the overhang on the macro with the fiscal cliff issue at least being temporarily resolved Other people have attributed it to a more traditional supply side driven pick up Where do you out on What might be the possible cause of this early move off the bottom and heard this from me many time when get asked whats the best leading indicator of the market the best leading indicator of the market is order people are it cant be simple well it is actually believe when you start to of and and described it on our call If you at and we saw a general breadth of decline and it wasnt any one area you saw inventory decline we see right now is inventory are very low can at in some of the public announcement the distributor and what theyre carrying a a result to guess to have a combination of macro economy hangover le and people being a lot lighter in term of where their supply is To me what becomes interesting is let now wind this out another and month and is to have more to do with macro economy want to keep staying constructive versus where the semiconductor industry is low inventory have typically been a good correlation though one of the thing you have talked about in recent analyst meeting and presentation is of concept of where were shipping versus the longterm demand trend and the longer you ship below trend the more likely it is were to see some improvement in the industry mean a we hopefully get through the bottom of this and into a better stage mean framework seem to make to you still you do the plot and you believe the plot and do a well because well over year of history any way you cut it the unit growth curve take pricing out about twice the rate of the economic growth because we have more chip in our life if updated but Ive looked were quarter under trend something in done the work and longer under the trend than any is not a prediction of a it get better or any of what we try to at running the is this world gone back to curve on behalf of our customer we better be if it try to can we do what love about where we sit is out of learning and out of experience we are in a position to go back to curve when or if it want to and were in a position to do with very low capital spending we ended last a under can easily get back on curve and not dent the number a well is a great place to be relative to the semiconductor industry definitely want to get into some of the bold thing done in term of adding capacity and thing along those line before we go there let go back to the inventory for a commented about how low it is your looking at the industry where do you we stand relative to previous historical if we indeed have the trough where are inventory relative to previous trough Lower than ever and the only careful about on is this industry get secularly better at how to operate with le inventory see it coming upstream go do a plot of year of distributor inventory show up on their balance sheet it a clear trend over actually with mind inventory being on our book because we can see it we can manage it how to do well it down on a longterm but this is even lower when you try to take a at curve you have some ability for to back believe you go back against year of trend line we do keep getting more efficient a an industry Now certainly am a believer in the trend line are believer in the trend line to client one of the pushbacks we get is Listen the trend line changed on one hand we deal with every cycle Every were above or below the trend line there the argument the trend line changed the other hand it never failed to predict over the long what the cycle would What would your argument be for the trend line not having changed greatest is at innovation and at the simplest word to of it is number of chip in our life while this world tends to be highly focused on smartphones and tablet and theyve been a wonderful for u and a wonderful boom for technology and the base station support it and all the thing can still happen also over to broader market the industrial market in many way have depended on electromechanical solution for the year and you see a of innovation starting to take place out in those area when count up the number of chip are to be in home and around u it up Airconditioners with wireless Connectivity and not because want to program it but because the service office can tell when compressor is wearing out and what part theyd have to bring out for a service call at automotive application and not only are the number of car growing but at safety system driver assist system entertainment system and you see a broader set of category than in a long we of course love because when you then in some of the application Ive described these thing absolutely center up on Embedded Processing and the component it where the focused the temptation is for people to focus on the issue in PCs where you have very exposure causing a declining slope of the overall trend line but the view is there a much silicon content in the tablet cannibalizing the and you do have content there although a market which well get into deemphasizing a bit at least on the application processor aside those tend to get a lot of attention because they move the needle in their but they move trend line when it all done If we focus on the auto market for a is something had in discussion in a lot of different session about obviously something people have been talking about for a long Do you the growth in silicon content in automotive is more about new feature were all to have in car we have even in the highend car or is the silicon opportunity more about what we have in the highend car go into the mainstream car because price decline to be a combination and your have the data even more than remember it were at car truck on a global this not too hard to find number of unit year out which to me is accurate enough to have a of what the underlying volume curve of the chassis is but to me where the real leverage is is the content per car in the you tend to get very fascinated because you see a lot of highend car a lot of European highend car coming in and you at collision these are great system theyre to improve safety were to see go across in many many platform Entertainment system kid growing up with iPhones and iPods are not to go backwards They expect to be able to get their entertainment their music the way they want it to end up having an influence the we see from spending a lot of over in China is this equipment doesnt remain in highend Mercedes or Audi is down across a very broad set of car a a result see content story around the world opportunity on a global and not highend car but down to some entrylevel vehicle picking up more and more electronics wasnt to ask this now but you mentioned China and some of the improvement in the macro data in China is commensurate with this pick up in semi frankly in the middle of last some of the problem we saw in the semiconductor coincided with some of the problem we saw in the macro data in general much of the recent improvement in semi activity you is of directly attributable to the pickup in the industrial economy would would partition it we all read the same of the general trend and the general mood and what the leading indicator are see it you of it Ill go back to of and were of seeing it across the board and not a want to be very careful in the same spirit and were not a go crazy number you see it happening in multiple location would not assign or get too on being China want to get back into some of the segment and see these ph opportunity in those segment later but before we do yes done a lot of bold thing a hope right call them bold for now and then well well go through and see go back to getting out of the DRAM which obviously a terrific decision and were talking a bit beforehand about the decision to get out of CMOS development and then you at what CMOS development cost and what company have to spend to continue on trend getting out of baseband even though you have the by far lion share of the market Now getting out of the OMAP and Connectivity for smartphones and tablet Buying a you acknowledged losing share and talking about at the you did the acquisition you about some of those thing and you tend to do thing ahead of and they tend to be controversial and which one of those do you feel obviously very good about retrospectively then how do you how would you mark yourself to market on the one were still ongoing Some way the greatest Ive learned and it of in the memory bank and the team in general is it pay to get to and focus on the best opportunity sometimes can hurt in the short but Ive never it not pay in the long if you the movie to end well stick around because it not if confidence Memory addition by subtraction back in the and it a great it helped accelerate u some of the acquisition we made back in and they were great to build u the franchise we have To me CMOS back in a nobrainer and it a nobrainer not because of the cost up but the differentiation you could get down you couldnt get more speed and you couldnt get lower power you couldnt get lower cost Things were in a different direction and so why have a model built around something cant provide differentiation were to turn around and find the move on National a great one because take a at year of history in semiconductor good catalog an industrial bias a you longlife product those application generate great value and we thought in National we had a great team of people and we had a great set of product they they could be directed better over the coming year and we were on the path of being able to go do capacity buildout back to a belief world usually gone back to growth curve around demand and Ive lived in world where spent a and had to then deal with depreciation build went through the roof and lousy work so this whole combination of having an and embedded model where you get very long asset life and then saying you what millimeter make but boy it make when you can go buy it for deeply discounted original acquisition cost Dont be afraid to go do it because equipment is to be used for year and itll pay back in many way now set ourselves up to have a tech can be one of the strongest generator of cash but more importantly a strong returner of cash because of thing done on tax and some of those we can connect those together and make it matter for investor on front a lot of work to still do to get translated good news is you back over the and year you see the reasonable indication of where were cash flow a a percent of revenue been growing from the upper teen into the low we returned over of cash flow the or year and those are thing we can keep doing on a sustainable meaning we can be competitive can invest can be growing the and yet do it with a very low capital build had the chance to buy more discounted millimeter capacity even though obviously were in a down part of the cycle and were underutilized in it is dragging down the shortterm margin Would you do another deal if it came up and not a flip or a reckless casual comment there one rumor you saw even a of week in term of and Ritchie and Marsh and our team sat down and take a simple of what are the limiting equipment to build out our millimeter facility at Renner RFAB and whats the smartest way to be able to go get capacity online if you can get it at a low enough percent of original acquisition cost it becomes a nobrainer in term of cash flow in term of what to do with all those rumor you saw a of week itll all fit well within any capital budget we talked about for this we guided at and it be a very small piece of to me it remains good smart you made the decision to get out of the wireless baseband even though you have the leading share of the market which obviously in retrospect is certainly a great decision at the when people are pushing you about OMAP you listen one day it be commoditized and when it is Ill get out of it until then to participate in the market and it a good cash flow generator Now reached the point where earlier late last you announced for the smartphone and tablet market getting out of the OMAP and Connectivity for market in particular you a bit about then can you a bit about are there any other part of the portfolio may be necessary to prune in some way we talked even at the analyst meeting the OMAP and Connectivity we saw the PL trust me theyre not exempt from they need to be good quality business the day we believe they can well do something different we announced back in the fall in many way when you saw the in some way concentration of the top supplier but then looked at the vertical integration trend to me all add up by the way it not the top have their eye on trying to do when you at some other supplier around the world a bad movie in term of where is to end so if it to destroy capital put more in it the background on why you do would have obviously loved for them to work but at the same taken those asset and there some intriguing thing and their team can go do how to through those thing and not be afraid of making call If you then ask are there others the better way to about is at it a are there other concentrated revenue position if you about where thing stop becoming highly valuable is too much revenue per socket attracting too many competitor per socket with not enough barrier potentially end up a not a great in the long you the portfolio were in good shape on equation Wireless the last of the place we had in some way you see with our customer diversity talked about at a of the meeting where when we were big in baseband Nokia over of rev our largest customer down single digit and a good because it indicative of diversity of strength and of breadth some concentrated position can at thing common infrastructure those are big market or customer do well with our multicore DSP there enough growth when you at small cell and where industry can go were to have to deal with for at least not for some could argue we still have some thing in the storage but starting to get down to very small percentage of overall revenue more importantly where our is being spent right now is let out over the next year and let make were asking ourselves if the last have been about building a great and embedded how can you now make stronger so we start to at how do you take the percent of portfolio address industrial and automotive up do you take your revenue across a broader set of customer meaning greater than or greater than how do you increase percentage building the portfolio in a very strong way on the for the out year where the strategic is essential ph a practical investment standpoint the investor who were here this week have a choice largecap semi there choice If we put QUALCOMM into another bucket because wind up a part of a different benchmark in a lot of people portfolio largecap choice investor have are taking very very different approach to the market are not worried about what your top line growth is and very focused on cash flow generation and even if it mean divesting business where you actually have an position other choice people have is a pursuing growth but coming at the expense of nearterm cash flow would you investor to about To me the modify only slightly is growth is high top line growth remains very high on our list the asterisk is top line growth with quality position and not trying to be cute you talked right we had some thing we had to get cleaned up OMAP and Connectivity wind down rapidly in now of the focused on and embedded and were in a position to grow those been gaining share in both of those area you over a on an incremental and wed to keep doing so growth is a critical element Now being do youll continue to hear u and continue to see u to be able to about the importance of cash flow generation in a much and done some of this work income statement are not always the best reflection of cash flow u saying let make were paying attention to what generates cash Oh by the way the nice is also to be able to return it where get excited about the product strategy again fitting together with the manufacturing fitting together tax and down through whole piece and what we can generate coming out the other end mentioned the returning cash to shareholder to save until later but you mentioned it now obviously you have been extremely aggressive returning cash to shareholder talked about over period of greater than philosophy obviously to continue to do because part of the company overall strategy do you balance it between future acquisition buyback and dividend guess separate it and off on acquisition youll find u remaining on a bias towards then you can of national is instructive catalog product we long life cycle we industrial those are all good thing when it come to generating value why we tend to favor of a opposed to any acquisition in embedded because the financial dynamic of embedded are different want the most amount of software per instruction set and buying thing doesnt increase leverage give you more instruction set itd be a bias on and the other is it to not meet those criterion but it to be able to pay back were very clear when we announced National this had to pay back in to year tends to be a important filter when you would at and by the way were still busy being able to grow National where our focus and attention is in the near If you over the or year a you over of our cash flow back of it been via buy back dividend dividend portion been growing increased dividend year now and theyre up aggressively it also an interesting with the wireless portfolio change now done we do try to spend understanding whats the smartest way to have return done it remains something were active with we spend with the board on we about acquisition obviously back in year there the BurrBrown and Unitrode acquisition created the base of large part of the core of what great is Then over the year between then and the National acquisition there a series of smaller acquisition and obviously National now Silicon Valley another very significant acquisition Going is how we should about it a big one and then while digestion is on some smaller one or do you have an appetite for another big one in the nearer careful answer is far more were focused right now because it important to do a quality job and let not get distracted then go on to not trying to characterize would it be small or big but stay focused in the near with what we have a you and good insight into a number of these company the number of thing meet spec of catalog of industrial with long life and by the way theyve to be able to pay back tends to shorten list down quite a bit because valuation are usually good on company doing heard me the National opportunity a onceinalifetime chance even though there were question about valuation paid at the to be able to get type of piece of property at the price we paid therefore we can make a payback but you see those often Is the payback the hardest criterion to meet so better company the ROI on the deal indiscernible Wellrun company they need to be valued there are company you would to have but the math doesnt work careful with to have and if stuff cant meet spec you even need to speculate mechanical how about then on Silicon Valley you the losing share talked about stabilizing and then turning around Where do you stand in transition process and how do you feel about it at this stage we described at the somewhat a logical flow which is expect it would be below market about market above logically it clear design in window or design in lead usually take long to be able to have a different result why would you it to magically get better in it falling about in line to what we expected on certainly have the benefit in hindsight of some experience with BurrBrown experience with Unitrode leading indicator all feel good in term of design win attention energy of people very pleased with whats happening on very quickly also the team internally leading indicator are nice result are what count and were now getting into so this be an important to start to see some of show up had talked specifically about some of the crossselling opportunity the complementary nature of their high voltage product and your portable product and across the data converter line Are those opportunity where you want them to be at this point and the audience heard this and this when you to other company acquisition are always a scary because you try to be very thorough in your analysis and your thesis of what to get then there you open up the box and you hope it close to what you were counting on where pleased is it everything and we havent had surprise in term of Oh gosh this busted or rotten or we didnt have and go back to were very thorough in what to expect and where thing were so thing highspeed converter and highspeed amp great complementary opportunity Things on the power side some of the capability of tool WEBENCH designer design power system online These were all hope to be good and they have turned out the quality of the people something the only way you can judge prior to the acquisition is you have to at the quality of the part and you well if theyre putting out the highquality part then there to be some good people doing it been pleased to find out did tie the team is pleased to be part of and more importantly it to be part of the team is pleased to have a chance to grow and win what most designer want is want my part to be successful want to be part of a winning team and want to see when design a chip want to see customer putting it in their system and ramping it up why a lot of our people get into this and working the retention of the engineer you were focused on keeping it worked out quite well so far and the you always have to remember is yes to be successful in year then also to make providing a great environment for the long not a event and where the focus is one end market wanted to back to and focus a bit on the communication infrastructure market a market been a bit weaker and not a bit weaker it been weaker maybe a bit frustrating for all of u over the last or If you take the bottomup carrier CapEx estimate and of at what implies market should certainly inflect this you are well positioned there wondering if you could about and then the small cell opportunity on top of the division of the broader market you almost asked and answered it in many way been very thorough on trying to make it easy for a group to yes yes our revenue is down but trust me were not losing share trust but verify you triangulate across you see the data you into the FPGA guidance which were good indicator and common for structure space is weak theyve also historically been again a you their supply chain tend to run hot when they get them hot they tend also go to the other extreme so if you take most of the public statement and what carrier plan are with CapEx agree with your translation even though thing of bleak right now it to be constructive a you move on my confidence is on front is were not moving fewer bit around this world and to go to advanced equipment because the only way to get data capacity up is to keep moving the carrier investment go up on front then go to the last part of your on small cell an extension only way the carrier are to get the spectral efficiency or the data capacity with the limited spectrum theyve is go to different architecture primarily small cell Youll find lot of speculation is it is it the lead are other country to follow careful only because lived through the rollout and we usually get a too worked up before the rollout but then it usually end up happening in largescale this one do some of same way which which but therell be more of equipment shipped in the future than le we actually used up all the even though we didnt get through all the question appreciate you being here again you so much and to doing it again soon and hopefully your longterm trend line is correct and indiscernible you and me both hope',\n",
       "       'well go to from Capital apologize if you already covered this if you could end market cited low visibility but we would love to hear guess your thought on how you see the booktobill tracking into and where you see the recovery coming from let start with the of part of your where you basically how is it continuing into guess what would is again maybe and before about go back and describe what we saw in the with a bit more detail revenue declined each obviously left a the weakest of the Booktobill a noted in the therefore a you might guess the demand visibility is poor What thus far in is both revenue and order have strengthened when compared with lead u to an outlook is a stronger than the booktobill and order might otherwise have suggested again a we have if you exclude the Wireless the from the rest of our revenue we would expect to decline about at the midpoint of our consistent with normal seasonality for a By end market have a lot of color Probably the best takeaway is what we saw in broadly weak Ill walk through a of end market Computing clearly continued to be weak in the Communications weak we gave you some good visibility directly into what we were seeing with handset and tablet again there are some TIspecific trend in there a were exiting some of those product line an infrastructure standpoint particularly base station again would describe market a weak with spending level by operator in Europe and China all remaining constrained to this point Consumer would maybe be an area where would thing are somewhat mixed TV sale remain weak generally reflecting the economy Industrial same weak Automotive of industrial would be mixed regionally with the sale in the strong but China and Europe both weak those were more what we were seeing by end market in the have any end market color to provide in term of our outlook Do you have a followon Capital helpful a followup in term of the RD guidance for the full can you discus what to expected the linearity look itll decline a bit in the half a we wind down the Wireless activity had some remaining commitment with Wireless customer well have to continue to honor during the half a we wind down expect by the middle of the it reach it run rate now go to from a clarification to make heard it right Did you OpEx would basically be flat because the cost saving are offsetting the usual seasonality do expect OpEx to increase a bit but it largely be offset by the saving from the Wireless restructuring we announced it wont be completely offset more looking on the embedded business now obviously one of your core business operating margin in is to have been depressed for year running even though flat revenue seemed to be what you could deliver you about is more of a margin or an OpExdriven phenomenon what sort of growth expectation do you have to get the operating margin in back to of a historical or a peer group average in the Embedded Processing your observation is accurate been operating at operating profit level below what we have in mind for may recall about year we stepped up significantly the amount of resource we were putting into particularly on the microcontroller side a it relates to our field application engineer and other activity to support the growth in product portfolio the meantime of course some of our stronger market in the Embedded Processing space namely the communication infrastructure being weak for the a well a catalog being somewhat weak in this generally slow macroeconomy between the weakness in our larger market and the fact we stepped up the investment plus those are combined it would cause the operating margin to be at level lower than we would prefer to have them operating at this is all about getting the revenue line back into a growth mode to absorb the cost structure in place in division now go to from can you about inventory trend what you expect the disti distribution to do in term of inventory then also what do you expect to do in term of your own utilization rate and inventory Ill about distribution and Ill about Again me maybe even add some color to what happened last because foretell a bit about what we should see partly if youll note we distribution inventory fell by over week last ending up at a under week About of decline is due to the conversion of SVA over to an inventory consignment program at distribution so with still in the early stage youll see a few more day of inventory impact over the next of quarter associated with SVA consignment conversion again would have the effect of lowering each maybe a of day disti inventory again could be overwhelmed by distributor choosing to start replenishing inventory a they prepare for a stronger market environment should they choose to be the one event we cant foretell do you want to about inventory the point made about change in SVA certainly result in net inventory revenue being distributor book wind up being on our book day of inventory were up a day in the to well within the range where we want to carry it out we go well continue to carry inventory level similar to what u carry this plus day a we become more and more and Embedded Processing focused if you take a at most of our competitor youll find in the recent quarter the average are between and day of inventory you should expect to see u carrying inventory day quite a bit higher than you might have thought about let year a utilization standpoint you asked the on Utilization down in the and we had an underutilization charge in the of about compare to about in the last arent we have a forecast for where go keep in mind production tends to lead expected shipment and typically wed see up seasonally we would be to be staging inventory in anticipation of a normal seasonal maybe if can add a more color of the reason we carry more inventory a and Embedded grow a a percentage of our revenue is a high percentage of those product are longlived catalog device They tend to be off the shelf tend to carry more inventory on those by the way because of the longlived nature of them inventory much lower risk of obsolescence than the type of custom product or very high volume product went to very few customer would be represented for example in area Wireless a mix change we become more catalog oriented in term of the product profile by nature our product our inventory trend up compared to our history Do you have a followon a quick one you give u sort of what your core is doing sort of this normal seasonality you go into what you we should be looking at assuming we get back to normal what we should of a normal seasonality for in and then also what would be the impact of the Wireless away on top of seasonality and to start by giving you average year seasonality unadjusted for any outlier year can do whatever you want on this already comprehends no Wireless and it comprehend SVA a part of it is reflective of the product line you are interested in average is minus Second is up forget also a of point impact at the associated with backtoschool seasonality for our calculator product line sequential average is then is down similarly to the backtoschool negative transition associated with calculator of down of those point directly from the calculator product line guess all can in term give you the seasonal pattern adjusted for Wireless Now of course this overriding to have a decline in the Wireless revenue have a profile quarterbyquarter of what decline other than generally we would expect a previously by the end of revenue is essentially gone Baseband be the number we gave you would put it down sub of revenue in the Of course OMAP and the connectivity line are larger than but we would expect they would be essentially gone by the we close out now go to from guess my on margin much did royalty help the a into trying to reconcile much better mix le of an underutilization charge with margin maybe doing my math wrong relative to the midpoint of your guide cant get much above to maybe high you help me reconcile please the margin the royalty in the about Going we expect to be about for the give or take a bit the margin outlook asking about it in your model keep in mind did mention our underutilization charge up this a we took our utilization down even a we readjust the factory in anticipation of a seasonal up average use of utilization across quarter wont change much we wouldnt expect our underutilization charge to change much to not what else you have in your model but maybe and maybe help explain where getting to is helpful guess a my followup when you at the left in the Wireless in the how much of is well would you use argue a core versus noncore had stayed a a separate bucket what of operating loss should we have expected at of revenue the best can give you is if you at last we had for the total we had roughly of revenue About of in the Wireless move over into the Embedded Processing what calling core there are also to clarify there some OMAP revenue already in the Embedded Processing addressing automotive but the amount of the Wireless about ratio is consistent with where we were at the end of the in if you use a a rough starting point for transitioning into you would get about the right number the decline when at on a percentage what represented for the Wireless about true for baseband also meaning translates to a over sequential decline in the Wireless revenue about same amount for baseband therefore for OMAP and connectivity it would also be about same amount in term of the mobile side of those product line guess your followon now go with from thinking about the product are related to Wireless for example you may crosssell when selling Wireless product have those product sort of followed your expectation now Wireless is falling off Are they sort of moving along the line you would have expected or better or worse at this point theyre moving independent of the Wireless action guess would which is generally what we would expect talked before even on the call clearly you can put together a more negative scenario say yes but OMAP Connectivity pull along revenue would argue our experience been we have to win those socket or those opportunity case by case and there is not much of a direct tie to the OMAP and Connectivity then we could even put together a more what Ill call bullish scenario say a lot of our historical application processor competitor we would to engage with them on their reference design for Power product because we were a direct application processor competitor suspect there some hesitancy to engage with on the reference design on some of these Power opportunity we have a great capability in Power and Integrated Power to align with their product portfolio and suspect youll find some of those door open a were no longer competing directly with them in the application processor space again those are different scenario could develop would to date were not seeing necessarily upside not seeing thing ticking down a a result of our Wireless were seeing thing move independent which is roughly a we would expect Do you have a followon do respect now to maybe a bigger picture on the cycle it sort of come in part is talking about a seasonal and at the same saying visibility is relatively low wonder if you can address issue maybe you can put in the context of the overall cycle and comparing and contrasting what were seeing versus what we may have in the in term of the way cycle play themselves out me clarify have not described our expectation a seasonal did previously give the average seasonality average for each of the quarter of the did describe our expectation at the middle of the guidance for the nonWireless revenue Basically it computes to a down which we described a seasonal were not trying to at this point make any commentary about our expectation for the now go to from of one can you about utilization in your RFAB and other fabs you had mentioned about or so in underutilization charge Is there a cash versus noncash component on these charge we wont wont go into detail by factory a to utilization because they fluctuate much every week every every did mention there of underutilization charge roughly half of is noncash half of it cash give or take a few in each side of Do you have a followon If were to at your profitability in the you had set a model of margin and operating margin if memory serf me right Now you were exiting the Wireless how should we about new model or operating model once the demand environment normalizes you should about it a becomes a bigger portion and Embedded Processing become an ever bigger portion should see more of what in the and is our ability to generate very very healthy level of cash flow result of u being more focused in area is our CapEx bill our capital expenditure bill be quite low in part because we have already invested at a very low cost and a lot of capacity in part because a and Embedded Processing become a bigger portion of our revenue they actually can use older factory for a longer of and so theyll require le capital renewal addition the RD bill is more manageable in those space versus where been especially in Wireless so up cash a well a we move you should be thinking about u a being able to not only continue to generate the kind of healthy cash flow we have in year but even improving which frankly is good news for our shareholder because a theyve u do for many year now we tend to return the overwhelming majority of cash flow to our shareholder in the form of stock buyback and dividend and expect we continue to do so now go to from Sort of a of big picture question excluding the Wireless winddown so if we focus on your core you give u of the big picture put and take of why you might see any different cyclical trend than any of your competitor other word a we hear your competitor potentially start to more bullishly about the cycle is there any reason to you wouldnt see the same suspect very difference mean of course you have to at those different competitor and consider how their market exposure compare with mean of course somebody highly focused is to have a different dynamic than what would Similarly somebody a very very high exposure to industrial might have a different exposure than what or with different profile than what would with our more broad exposure what we often find a we go through this process and observed is in the end we all tend to see the same the same market dynamic with varying pressure a described coming into the maybe different level of subjective impact on those various guidance Do you have a follow on and guess Ill stay on topic for my followup mean the reason asked the is because maybe it a tone issue or of semantics but relative to a of the other company have reported and talked about the industry you sound quite a upbeat again to your previous answer would have expected similar tone and trying to gauge if there anything significantly different driving would were respectful of the actual order pattern in the last of quarter the booktobill of in and in overall order declining quarteroverquarter caused u to be respectful a to what the outlook might hold while we tempered a bit a indicated earlier in the call despite declining sale and revenue recent month the we have a turn in direction in certainly so far is shaping up stronger than what did so for reason were putting our outlook out there and saying were to be of seasonal on the nonWireless portion of our portfolio now go to from for the next quarter guidance the Wireless look it falling off maybe am doing my math right would be to of of the total you have actually away over the next it doesnt the OpEx is falling off nearly much yet guess the there is number one is math correct Youre having actually a very big it sound a very big step down is it on magnitude is the OpEx fall off actually le than actually the revenue fall off for then what is the OpEx trend in term of capturing in saving through the do we actually have it all in Ill discus the OpEx you were talking about may be wrong again what we the in our Wireless be down which would be about totally realize you may be trying to take a subset of Wireless tie to the product are away so right right not saying not wrong reiterating what we do you want to comment on OpEx saving on the OpEx we expect to see saving feather it way in to the PL over the course of saw a bit in the something in the get another to or so a we move into the and continue at of pace until we get to the end of the talked about by the we get to the end of the on an annualized we should see about from the cost coming out of the most of the OpEx line it is there to go ahead sorry to add in the you have to have factor is we are exiting these product line the other is seasonality with some of these wireless customer which tends to be significant in the to transition Go ahead Do you have a follow on to guess a a followup on is it fair to then the hit for the Wireless in a a percentage of the stuff should be away losing more of revenue in than losing the OpEx Is a correct way to about this maybe when you about a the GPM were losing on revenue is falling away at about the same pace a the OpEx may be a better way to about it so what the result is is division by itself profitability isnt to be noticeably different than what we came through until we get the benefit of the rest of the winddown of the OpEx on in the balance of the theyll accelerate a we move through Move through the well go to from wonder if you go back to the analyst meeting earlier in you talked about the trend line analysis and looked at the sort of we were and indiscernible below the trend line and about the potential for catching up obviously the weaker macro disrupted believe there potential there and it didnt play out do you about now you about Are we still below our trend line Do you there a catchup and what can drive to happen would history a soon a you deny the history you usually wind up finding yourself in trouble the history taught u we do tend to go back to trend line is a unusual a you pointed out we havent made move back yet would simply wouldnt try challenging the history it to to pas at some point a difficult to call when Whats more important is operationally we intend to be ready for it by what mean is we intend to have ample capacity when it come back we intend to do have ample inventory on hand so were able to respond our customer when they do start seeing their normal demand trend occur when they back toward trend line what is cool about position is were not sitting here betting our or betting our future on a particular forecast bought capacity when it cheap and when it and we are in position to support much any of upturn profile you can envision over the next or so if it take a while longer so be it it fully in the number If it want to run hard and fast were ready to go we need to go significantly change our capital spending profile to get there Do you have a followon state of the end customer inventory at this point it seems been lean for several quarter had a fair amount of inventory on your book the distribution channel had enough and it feel the customer hasnt needed to restock Do you dynamic stay in place is there a catalyst can get a restocking phase to start a soon a consumer feel a bit more confident have a bit more of certainty a to where thing are they return to a more normal behavior which mean they wont be continually relying on u being able to ship to them the lead time customer generally perceive a being a somewhat risky strategy if in fact their demand should return the big issue is waiting for some of the uncertainty to clear up Certainly the macro event over the last have compounded with the Euro headline with the China slowdown although it sound it maybe is beginning to turn a bit on front here in the of course the fiscal cliff only had one part of dealt with so far and it appears more of some of stuff get behind u expect our customer go the back to carrying inventory level where they control their destiny a bit more better than relying on supplier to be able to ship of lead and certainly a you before any other outcome would be a big bet against history which tends to repeat itself here well now go to from of Montréal Capital on the Silicon Valley correct me if wrong it seems you are a ahead of what you promised u in term of getting in sync with the rest of the if so is it too early to call turn do you expect to see pattern in the following quarter have a followup Ill add a then if you want to go with it can a well would not describe it a a ahead if youll recall we in the we expect the we expected me back up postacquisitions which ended in of we expected it would continue losing market share which is a trend had been on the we expected it would become would call it market neutral meaning the market share loss would stop it would still be lagging overall performance since we have a much stronger history over multiple year of share gain did not expect and do not expect SVA to start having a strong track record of share gain consistent with the rest of until the shouldnt we do not expect should what we had built into our initial assumption and modeling preacquisition a you noted from our comment we have a here where it performed consistent with the rest of even despite a strong headwind of consignment conversion in the would is even though we found performance encouraging by no mean are we to declare success an encouraging sign we need to see of those quarter strung together before we start declaring anything for the do you have anything else than do you have a followon Capital moving over to the Embedded side you please refresh our memory how big is the Comm infrastructure within then where are we from the peak if remember correctly the margin from a normalized around is about bps higher to bps higher than the Ill comment on the revenue mix there and then if you have any comment on relative margin and compared to where we were if you take the overall me break out the Embedded Processing revenue for you Catalog of the revenue mix and the same a it in Comms infrastructure of our Embedded Processing revenue and down about point from where it in of the mix then automotive of our Embedded Processing revenue last and up from mix is driven by the disproportionate strength and sorry weakness in the communication infrastructure market last combined with the fact high market share in comms infrastructure market a market we is to have good secular trend in the year ahead even though it hurt u a bit in term of Embedded Processing share last we wont forego our position by any mean nor make apology there similarly automotive the market good last a what describe a a building position in automotive do you comment then on the profitability you we actually report margin detail of the business at a high if you about how these business run Embedded Processing component we talked about catalog component are there tends to be similar to an HPA SVA of model to see margin margin north of the other side automotive product includes some legacy product we have in portfolio you see those margin somewhere closer to the then comms infrastructure tend to run in between the of those over next come from from the you talked already talked a bit about the Silicon Valley wondering if you could share with u some of the dynamic happening in the other segment look for the or at least on a yearoveryear the High Volume Logic and the Power were relatively stronger than the High Performance wondering if you could give u some color either on market share or market dynamic there me and most of these be with respect to the a opposed to necessarily for the full would the HPA decline broadbased can pull out a particular market or product area HPA not quite a much a or HPA and SVA would combined they have a common characteristic of being more catalog oriented moving through distribution They have higher industrial exposure than what some of the other area would have so potentially could in a well HVAL would we saw some impact from a few area is the HDD market being weak other consideration in the consumer seasonality basically backing down off of what would typically be a stronger then also in the we saw automotive being a bit weaker If you at the Power area sequential trend there driven again broadbased but the biggest area would of were most notable would be decline in notebook digital television and then also to a lesser degree handset Do you have a followon a housekeeping on the tax side of thing you have a tax benefit in and you have full guidance for of Does the include the benefit youd get in it not benefit in is a discrete benefit be spiked out by itself about or about of EPS is the effective tax rate excluding benefit so the ongoing rate for the would note rate include now the reinstatement of the RD tax credit for a of hint then when looking at your tax rate in term of your model plan on and then on top of add in the benefit if you at normal PDT and all apply a tax rate and then on top of add in the sorry discrete tax benefit not spread across the or anything of the ongoing rate be rate go to from so my you talked about disti resale being down in the What were sale to disti in the is looking off the top of my head resale were down a bit also their resale were down a bit but our sale to them were down a bit a well with their inventory declining a we mentioned by a day to le than week again inventory decline we shipped in le than they shipped out doesnt necessarily change the growth rate anyway down a bit a well Do you have a followon helpful followon is you cant comment on booking by end market so far this could you comment on maybe by region is this very broadbased whether it OEM or disti term of the trend Correct yes have a regional breakout can offer you a consolation prize and about what happened regionally last since we havent discussed have the monthtodate data by region this last this is a weak consolation prize Ill admit because it revenue a opposed to booking in the we had all region down with Asia being down the most would be followed then by the a well there Europe and Japan Sorry we didnt have detail for you with were to close off the call we end me you a of this call is on our concludes today presentation you for your',\n",
       "       'well hear from with is calling in for have a quick on the profitability a nonGAAP it look a better is all driven by wireless the cost reduction were the restructuring were doing in wireless wont have any significant impact this a most of the employment reduction are happening late in the What seeing translates to about better on a a you call a nonGAAP or however you would get there what would is were continuing to generally tighten down on expense where possible and is considering the weak environment were operating in again holding a tight rein on expense have a followon a followup do you the Wireless can get to breakeven in the calendar if so do you expect to be able to stay breakeven a revenue decline me the answer to whole situation is complex me start with the would wireless clearly in the have an operating loss because it include the restructuring charge Going have a date for you on when loss go away a it depends on how fast the revenue decline relative to the cost we back on our call we expect our baseband revenue in be about half of the it in the again considering the baseband revenue declining and then on top of how fast the OMAP and connectivity decline occur from a revenue standpoint drive what happens from our profitability or loss perspective you for your call well hear from with me a follow up on the last What do you see is the tail for the OMAP and connectivity seems your customer base in the next of quarter doesnt change all much mean is there to be a fairly healthy tail in the next quarter a good should have clarified on the prior call the revenue there which this for OMAP and connectivity product are sold into smartphones and tablet application be about total the it be right around again not the entire revenue for OMAP and connectivity because some of is sold into embedded application a hundred dollar in the overall for sold into smartphones and tablet or the in for smartphones and tablet we would expect to decline through the course of such it gone by the we enter then a similar trajectory in term of the cost saving cost decline through the course of and a we enter we have about of annualized cost saving again a we enter or by the end of Do you have a followon on note the how split between operating expense and cost of sale saving the estimate we have is about of be RD about SGA and then about cost of revenue you our next come from of one following up on the OMAP side of thing with connectivity Do you expect any impact on your side of your a some of those connectivity product and OMAP brought along for the ride mean clearly we have not would agree theyre along for the ride we do have good content typically in a system where were selling OMAP yet clearly if we have an application processor in the system give our sale folk good visibility into overall system being those product of have to earn their way each product Customers arent to accept an interior product because theyre using our application processor our view is our product continue to do fine in the tablet and smartphone application in fact what can can also envision the scenario they could even benefit because mean about we work with other application processor supplier on their reference design to include our product to the extent they view u a an application processor competitor we might find some of those other application processor supplier more amenable and cooperative on the side well see conjecture but well do fine on the side of those system Do you have a followon do Getting away from OMAP maybe for a about the midquarter you tightened to the midpoint of on revenue either product line or end market color you can give u about positive and negative quartertodate please me make a of reminder you would guess the fact we tightened to the middle of the is generally most area are tracking consistent with our expectation we had in a a reminder there are a few special consideration in this sequential trend this a reminder is worth a few minute of all our calculated revenue typically declined by about in the following the peak backtoschool season Second consideration is we had in the of interruption insurance proceeds the final settlement from last year earthquake in Japan amount not recur again this the final point would make is in our call explained our SVA product line would begin to convert over to a consignment inventory program at distribution this and is the result of u getting SVA which again the former national semiconductor operation converted over to system with well be able to move them to the same type of consignment inventory program we have with distributor conversion impact our revenue this certainly distributor are anxious to move over to the program with those consideration would the remainder of our semiconductor revenue is generally clustered around a to sequential revenue decline an end market standpoint me quickly go through those Computing continues to be weak this communication would characterize it also a weak If you at handset and tablet our baseband revenue we would expect to be seasonally flat maybe even up a this although be more than offset by revenue decline in OMAP and connectivity again for smartphones and tablet guess normally provide a longerterm outlook in this update but given our recent announcement to discontinue our investment for OMAP and connectivity product in the smartphones and tablet area me go ahead and note we expect this revenue again to decline from about to be gone by the end of a reminder on communication infrastructure particularly wireless base station revenue continues to be weak with spending level by operator constrained much across the world specifically the Europe and China where there a historically been those region have historically been driver there Consumer a a result theyre somewhat mixed TV sale remain weak a they were last reflecting the overall economy we believe actually the emergence of tablet a an alternative viewing device for video is having some impact there a well Game console are doing well and ebooks also are doing well for then finally in industrial would overall demand generally remains weak Inside of our automotive sale are mixed regionally with the strong but both China and Europe weak a long answer to a quick you for well hear from with wondering if you could give u a bit of color on order linearity last the earnings call you order were the low point in Octobers of flattish you give u some view for how and tracking relative both to those point in relative to your expectation have feedback for you on linearity but what is in general we expect order decline this and theyre largely tracking the revenue result trend what mean by is theyre weakest for our other segment due to the seasonal calculated decline and again nonrecurrence of the interruption insurance Theyre also weakest for our SVA product line due to the conversion to the distribution consignment program and the impact it both on revenue a well a order have the monthbymonth linearity feedback for you Do you have a followon do helpful around if go back to wireless a the chunk remaining the embedded OMAP connectivity it in annual revenue right now What are your target for the economics of following the completion of your restructuring Is to be making money Is it to be breakeven or be losing money at Do we assume growth in order to make money expectation is the loss our wireless incur over the last few quarter largely be eliminated by the restructuring action we have underway so not assuming growth or anything taking the loss and taking the cost action and recognizing were to lose about of revenue and therefore profit is associated with the cost saving were implementing should largely offset or essentially offset loss so well leave it at you Moving on well hear from with especially for the market commentary by area consideration of is there an area where you feel more most confident your under shipping demand and inventory getting drawn down in the channel then conversely are there are still area where you you might be over shipping demand of any area were over shipping demand mean there could be some out there but theyre not visible to u would in general were shipping consistent with demand and inventory level are very low or there still could be some area inventory continuing to be reduced one area would draw underscore anything in term of what were seeing this but for example in the communication infrastructure an area we highlighted experiencing some inventory reduction Probably another one would highlight is distribution this guess would note resale from distribution we expected to decline this but at this point it look distributor could also reduce some inventory well see how the rest of the play out at this point we would expect theyre to reduce some inventory Do you have a followon do helpful then of back to about the attach rate of the pull through a we at the wind down of the OMAP and connectivity segment in certain area when you back on the history or lesson learned from the baseband wind down do you did you see any reduction in pull through or attach rate on in those segment did you see steady share in with the customer or the SKUs you wound down with baseband not aware there any notable shift in our penetration in those customer system where we have baseband then when we out of the baseband we saw decline in other product line would in the case of baseband practically no if any impact we would expect similar with the product and the OMAP connectivity fact again we have we do have good content in many of the OMAP system but we can also find customer system use our OMAP product at all where our content a high again for the most part we would have to those socket are won individually and they tie very directly to the OMAP processor you our next is of you give u an update this about any shutdown planning or any color at all on your manufacturing the shutdown and idling occur through the course of the holiday vary from factory to factory a it every depend upon demand et cetera for particular product are manufactured in those factory some we certainly be idling through the course of the holiday a we typically do by the way a mean by which we can most cost effectively manage when we have open capacity such a we do a mean by which we handle lower level of utilization cost effectively we be doing through the course of these holiday but it vary factory by factory do you have a followon you also a bit about lead time If recall correctly lead time were fairly short at the beginning of the wondering have they short or any movement at all there no movement of significance at all would lead time overall remain very short with the strong majority continuing to be below week for you our next is of Kind of on thread do you expect utilization rate to up in either or then for your own my followup would be for your own inventory whats your expectation for them in term of dollar and day in and maybe in if you have a view on maybe you missed this is the midquarter update can about utilization trend this which are consistent with what we expected in Utilization be lower in the compared with a we reduced new production start in response to weaker demand What happens with utilization in and beyond have a lot to comment on at this have nothing to comment on at this point then in term of own inventory guess would in light of our action to reduce the production level in our factory described we would expect our inventory decline this a day standpoint it a more complex would inventory day even with the absolute reduction in inventory you could see day still drift up a and in consideration revenue also decline in the believe your question Do you have a followon term of your it sound your expense are doing a bit better you u in term of the OpEx linearity it normally come up in and then partially in is the normal linearity talking normal you have restructuring on which is of bringing it down good point OpEx typically is down in seasonally and reflects more vacation and holiday is taken in the compared with the and then reverse itself in the typically a le holiday and vacation occurs then the other consideration in the is the annual pay and benefit increase are implemented in the of usually from a seasonal standpoint we see some increase in OpEx in the a well and didnt mean to give you question there but glad you appreciate next is of wonder if you can expand a bit on some of the comment you made about inventory in the channel we also heard from one of your competitor who recently thought there some destocking on Do you have any metric you could share with u in term of where we are relative to normal level looking comment on perhaps the sustainability of the channel inventory at these level even taking into account where the level of demand are right now what would is if youd listen to u those few quarter been running week or so over the last few quarter is a lean inventory characterize way lean by historic standard and lean even comprehending we are carrying some of what historically distributor inventory on book a consignment inventory again a thing have happened Inventories are lean but also implemented the consignment program even adjusting for they were lean want to give you any of projection on the other than we could see a few more day out of inventory it at this point the data usually is not very predictive of the full would we at this point would be expecting to see a few more day of inventory out of distribution Is sustainable believe so in general the channel inventory and to the insight we have at customer would we believe inventory level are lean and therefore from a risk standpoint it somewhat asymmetric They are lean relative in consideration of the weak environment if there any growth start to occur again we would fully expect replenishment to occur both in distribution a well a at customer carry their own inventory again the lean inventory are there reflect economic uncertainty and relatively weak demand currently clearly there be replenishment if growth is to occur again you next is of to clarify did you your lead time are to week right now the strong majority of our lead time are week or le if the channel is carrying about week then understand it lean from a historical perspective but isnt sufficient given where your lead time are What would be the incentive for them to restock it a of false impression pull everybody in it fine if lead time and everything are totally stable we are from the standpoint of positioning our own inventory and all and certainly our capacity we try to keep it positioned such we be able to maintain lead time short more generally in our industry short lead time occur in the trough of the cycle or during relatively weak period then when customer demand start to back lead time tend to extend and cause customer demand to get even more heated a customer then try to replenish inventory do believe more broadly in the industry current inventory level and current lead time are sustainable way well see only based on year of semiconductor industry history have this be different but wouldnt bet on it do you have a followon helpful hoping you could specifically about common infrastructure to the big for you on one hand were hearing about ATT spending more capital but at the same you are talking about a reduction in inventory maybe some specific on what seeing from the comm infrastructure space and if you could it by geography be helpful have a lot to there other than Europe China all being weak a previously believe when at revenue trend this theyre very consistent with what we believe the card shipment are from the equipment provider overall there could be a some component inventory reduction but there not a big distinct difference between what were seeing with our shipment and what we believe is happening in term of shipment to the operator currently realize there are operator have forecast more capital spending et cetera but still likely ahead of u a opposed to anything impacting our this you for your question and we have for one final Certainly and from of the cost saving you get from your exit of the Wireless a progress do you actually manage to reduce in absolute term your operating expense do they keep rising because you have other thing investing in Oh you mean for for a a whole Boy want to try to project mean theyre seeing manage our expense overall tightly and you continue to see what can assure you is is not moving out of our Wireless into other part of These are cost are leading you would if you consider how much were spending in operating expense currently we would clearly translate to a net reduction again the only were forecasting here is what were doing of our Wireless and Ill provide you the assurance a those cost are truly leading a opposed to shifting somewhere else of Do you have a followon connectivity product exiting are they manufactured inhouse if so what percentage of manufacturing do these currently represent What would is in both of these area connectivity and OMAP most of the production is done through party foundry a we exit these this this not have an impact on capacity utilization not have traded capacity a a result of this action with we go ahead and wrap up What is before we end the call me you there a on our you and good Ladies and gentleman today you again for your',\n",
       "       'take our from with guess the is of a strategic one to start which is understanding a lot of the capacity you have is very strategic and it not to go obsolete much lower would the cycle have to get or how much longer would the cycle have to stay at these depressed level before the would thinking about would about taking action to mitigate some of the shortterm capacity and maybe put some margin leverage back in the model we have any more plan to take any more capacity offline than what we already announced what we announced back in the on the general earnings release we would be closing older factory the one in Hiji Japan and one in Houston expect the factory to close late in the half of one of them and the other one early in the half of Right now our focus is on maintaining the stateoftheart factory because frankly their cost is quite low and go ahead and take these older le economically advantaged factory offline Do you have a followon if could sorry if missed it during the remark the factory loading in andor any thought about inventory for factory loading in declined quarteroverquarter and so consequently our underutilization charge did increase our reduced outlook for were further reducing our factory loading into the wont predict where our inventory actually land at but point out we do expect the factory loading to decrease further in the which also mean our underutilization charge are expected to increase in the a well next is with Capital guess hoping you could provide some color around margin and OpEx guess within you talked about an effective tax rate for the full of now wed be thinking therefore around in or if you can provide some help there a well there a of thing in them me make get to them all the tax rate we expect to be in the and starting from tax rate a you build your model and you out into the future for and you try to model our earnings you should tax the incremental profit at and fall through to the implied tax rate for it relates to margin margin in the of the but Ill you we did have a insurance reimbursement came through in the definitely benefited the margin a bit in the it relates to your on OpEx we did bring OpEx down in the believe overall were down about quarteroverquarter a we out in the would expect we would continue to bring OpEx down especially in light of a weaker demand outlook given our guidance me clarify also lower effective tax rate we made the adjustment in the would cumulatively get the to tax rate therefore our expectation is it would be at effective tax rate barring any other additional discrete item Do you have a followon Capital one quick one talked about the consignment inventory program with SVA should we about guess the impact to revenue from line item over the next or a get built into the model have a quarterbyquarter guidance to give you what we it would be about in total convert over to the program at any point in the revenue is converting basically shift out about to quarter a we step sorry to month and it move out about to month and we complete the entire conversion process of in to quarter again a we let if in the a an example please take this a guidance If we were to convert of SVA revenue over to this consignment support basically would not be in in this upcoming but would move out to the sorry into the then to the extent we took additional revenue and converted over to consignment let or in the following then there would be another to depending upon the actual amount of additional headwind in again during the process in which were converting so to there be a headwind in potentially sequential growth and certainly in yearonyear growth comparison for SVA again the total amount at the be minimal if looking at the SVA product line it be a more meaningful impact to well go next to with want to get into the restructuring on wireless but can you in general about the operating expense for next a you about taking some of the RD out focused on some of the big vertical market and focusing on embedded Whats the overall impact on your operating expense structure a mentioned in my opening remark there are quite a few question on our plan for the OMAP and Connectivity product a it relates to wireless handset and tablet and we have any additional comment to give you on right now a were working through those plan a soon a we do we share those with everybody Do you have a followon then Ill try a separate dividend increase you did in the can you about what drove the decision to do and how you about us of cash between the buyback and dividend increase and other opportunity the decision to increase is a function of the emerging model for a it continues to evolve and is even if you take a at the most recent about of our revenue were coming from our and Embedded Processing technology and unit those are area not only enjoy a relatively robust margin but because of the RD and manufacturing nature of those product produce very robust level of cash a we have been committed to for a long we continue to return cash to our shareholder in the form of those dividend and stock buyback and increase represents the ongoing confidence of model continue to produce of cash flow in the future take our next from with term of the revenue guidance even if subtract the impact of guess it about from all of the thing coming and you still appear to be guiding substantially below the booktobill you tell u if there anything else on in there then also how impact what would be normal seasonality in or how should we be thinking about booktobill is a is one consideration in guidance Certainly we at order we at order trend would note is when we at order linearity through the course of the the of the lowest in the called the trend of order a we move through the a consideration the other would is recall only about of revenue operates on traditional backlog and order entry process about of our revenue is supported by consignment program so with the consignment program were getting the forecast information from those customer but it doesnt show up a an order until the customer actually is ready to take the product or for u to ship the product again order are part of the story but theyre not the whole story there Do you have a followon so you are guiding for a tough environment in been tough all If this environment persists ie if this the new normal what where or what could you do in term of capacity and OpEx to shore it up a bit asked earlier about any capacity consideration we have and sort of addressed one wont repeat one the OpEx front a mentioned early on also we be expecting to take tighter control on certainly a we go to and reduced outlook well continue to manage Opex a we traditionally do to what our revenue outlook is so to the extent the revenue continues to be a challenging environment well continue to manage OpEx in a very tight fashion it about all can give you for color on right now mean again we talked about the capacity side if your mindset is very well might be the new normal would much more pessimistic than is about our longterm outlook for our we view or through a rough patch for the economy overall but by no mean do we translate to the new normal for our next is with of one clarification why operating margin in your Other were so high over of sale Was there anything special in this in the Other is where we book these nonrecurring item for example the gain we had on the Japan pitch plan of booked into and also the recovery we had on the interruption insurance booked to another you saw go in there clearly the of those combined is to bump up operating margin percent handsomely right then the main is if at your core and if you at the profitability of applestoapples how it compare with what a linear or an device or a Maxim are doing Do you your margin are comparable If not why not understand there a capacity utilization aspect but what can you do to get close to the profitability of those other company the publicly reported result of those company actually show the benefit of the model been trying to develop for overall because it certainly produced very very high and attractive margin very low capital intensity and still generate lot of cash Probably one of the larger difference between and most of our competitor is we have quite a bit more capacity than they do so clearly our various segment including our is experiencing portion of the end utilization charge a a result of capacity we also believe with our continuing share gain and might mention we do believe we have been gaining share again this in we would expect to fill up capacity and so capacity continues to be quite valuable to our strategic plan a we would also add when you take the product in our portfolio and if you compare them to any of those competitor you might choose our margin are very comparable with the exception of underutilization difference here or there in general the margin we have for comparable product are very similar to of our competitor is what suspect because our pricing strategy are similar not our objective to go out and underprice not our objective to overprice basically price the product competitively and then try to win on feature and performance and support we can offer customer from a cost standpoint a manufacturing cost standpoint put our cost up against any manufacturer in the world in term of bigger difference when you at our overall is we are a much larger player than any of the company you named when you your strategy is to a it is in some of those case is to run a very high margin and be selective only for those piece of support margin a fine strategy for particular but it to result in a lower revenue strategy is to generate a very large generate a very attractive cash flow and mean were to participate in a broader spectrum of than what some of those more narrow competitor would be would suggest the bigger difference and in fact when we go headtohead with comparable product to those various competitor margin are very similar well go next to with apologize if you mentioned this but given we of view the core revenue stream a bit different from the wireless revenue stream can you a bit about relative to the overall guide for of how you see wireless trending and if there any significant change with the component of wireless with wireless we recorded this if you of the piece then you OMAP Connectivity and baseband Baseband reported about in the and we expect to be about the same in for the rest of wireless into those area to be sub is what we expect in the OMAP Connectivity in were so dipping more so than the overall even though we generally give guidance further out we told you for some baseband continue to decline and essentially be gone in expectation is flat and then cut in half a we roll in the at point were down below of total revenue essentially down to Do you have a followon relative to your answer to about the between booktobill in versus guide in you the worst of the of a we in here to have you found the bottom yet in the or how would you of characterize the start to this versus the finish of the last would it is running very consistent with the outlook we provided not it not a big bounceback would cause u to the number given nor it deteriorated such to the point whether we those number again again no real trend change in the of would cause u to revisit one or the other guess one could point out and this is not so much for the of but if you back at another metric we at our cancellation and cancellation in the actually were down would would be down below what we would consider normal level when we take data and put it together we had a small upside in the it of point to view we have customer and distributor running lean level of inventory and continuing to provide u short visibility in order they placed in the form of backlog at the same were in a position where our lead time are short our inventory is sufficient allows u to operate well in environment but it the nature of the market environment were operating in well take our next with the one around wireless you not to give any guidance on what to do in general wondering if you could a bit about how easy it actually is to separate out the embedded portion of OMAP and Connectivity from the more traditional wireless easy is it to separate those disparate RD organization and how the RD intensity between those actually the separation certainly from a product standpoint is fairly straightforward a you point out from an RD standpoint the engineering team a bit more of an effort are some people devoted exclusively to the Embedded Processing application of those technology a opposed to the wireless or the tablet and cellphone application there are some engineering team actually cross both area because there some commonality the one a more challenging to for realignment purpose it relates to on a goforward the separation the we find is under way again well report on when we have a bit more behind u in the future one could add because you were saying asking not plan but how the RD intensity on the embedded side compare with the RD intensity on for smartphones and tablet the answer is it le on the embedded side what we found thus far is OMAP and Connectivity for embedded application look a lot our other embedded product line in many way from an RD perspective for example a lot of the RD we spend on the embedded side is focused on creating derivative basically looking at different interface et cetera you put around on packaging various qualification option a lot more in the form of application node software a opposed to in smartphones and tablet where on a rapid cadence of introducing a completely new architecture generation part can slow down and you focus more on spinning off derivative product investment from standpoint RD on the embedded side of OMAP and Connectivity is a lower investment than whats needed on the smartphone and tablet side Do you have a followon there very briefly last when it came to about what seasonality looked you actually gave the detail of a calculation correcting for Nat Semi correcting for base and rolloff and you even posted the detail on the you give me give u an idea of what same calculation actually would on a historical for is basically flat is flat if you do a average you would see revenue down includes a dramatic drop in the of exclude a an outlier Basically get revenue flat to hold true for our calculator a well a overall we have any of significant calculator seasonality in would affect u the way it in again to your point not if you go back and at the record book not necessarily a a a reported number is including SVA historical revenue and excluding baseband and we make both of those adjustment to try to mirror what our current portfolio look and what those historical trend might tell you about revenue trend on a goforward well go next to with If at the sequential decline provided for the and recognized there are some put and take in there we can adjust for still amount to the worst sequential decline for in the last year it the sixth worst sequential decline for the in the last year wonder if you can about in light of those fact about what you may be different than how thing were in the period when thing this bad Is it different Is it the same the environment changed Sunshine Ill answer your from a macro standpoint certainly there a lot of we of surveyed the global environment looking in the you a fiscal cliff people are wondering whats to wind up happening a potential change in many people in the national government and lot of discussion about regulatory and tax change and certainly causing people to of sit on the sideline and perhaps wait and see what new rule are to be China you this similar sort of and theyve a once in change in their government happening this fall you to imagine those people have a similar perspective some of the rule may change with the new government and so therefore they would also be inclined to slow down much the same way a we see here in the finally in Europe again similar Everybody know there a serious debt problem must be addressed and to require some meaningful change certainly in the tax environment and other regulatory element there can imagine a similar sort of there if tried to compare this environment to some of those doom and gloom one you alluded to in the last year or more these are certainly example of thing are quite different from any during those year Do you have a followon it of relates to the one because actually in those doom and gloom period whats interesting is they last all long one would argue actually maybe there a recovery coming in the next of quarter want and on the other hand hear from some of these industrial company not chip company we could be in this of environment for the next quarter wonder when you about and how shaping the the cost structure for the are you sort of gearing for a flattish of environment to be on the safe side are you hoping there are you thinking there some of recovery bound to happen given how bad thing are now before answer the on of what we might be thinking about in cost et cetera me if we go back to late late early how many of u a we were into downturn thought we were entering into a multiyear of weakness it lasted quarter and we were back up to the race again we all need to be aware of how wrong been in the and what might about where we are it What about to is to be wrong me clearly what we have done is anticipate were to grow whether or not the economy rose and price along with it we grow because were able to compete more successfully against our competitor with better product and better manufacturing remains to be why we invested in the manufacturing capacity we have and it already bought and paid for even if we do wind up with a flat environment unattractive or a very strong growth environment very attractive our manufacturing footprint is taken care of CapEx bill is basically behind u and so the result should be either whether result of growth is to be very nice in the bottom line but certainly to the cash generation deliver for u it relates on the OpEx front clearly in the near were slowing down OpEx expenditure in light of the revenue environment were looking at well into them and manage those tightly may recall we had talked in the the model we have for OpEx in period of relatively weak revenue growth our OpEx is to be pushing up towards in period of stronger revenue growth our OpEx slide down closer to were in the mid to upper right now and well have to see where well go we be operating with Opex those range and well see where the revenue outlook actually take u and adjust accordingly well go next to with Back to the SVA side and the conversion to consignment can you give u a ballpark of the absolute revenue for SVA in your guidance are you assuming consignment transaction or transition actually hit the revenue starting in the there begin in it have an impact on revenue in and fully comprehended to the extent we have it in our guidance Also in term of the SVA side half of this have this updated through but half of this SVA about of our overall revenue you can scale it from there a followon switching gear to the often forgotten Other category it seemed you had a of thing very well in with insurance and calculator it seems to be up roughly but the whole only grew it seems there a big dropoff in something else you through what happened in the other part of Other on a certainly the interruption up Youre talking about the revenue so the interruption insurance went through the revenue line driving up and offset by DLP being down and ASIC being down on a sequential Those are the main moving part there well take our next with one for if take out the insurance proceeds the margin still up yet your production down are we looking at an improving mix here Is all get easy have a followon and this one for you mentioned what expecting in is basically customer demand being down yet giving a very wide what are some of the moving part here a far a your customer are concerned again saying there no inventory adjustment this is true demand wondering why the wide straightforward and it to do with lead time are running short isnt a case where lead time are on average week would into the with the much fully booked this case lead time are very short and so there is a based upon our backlog the backlog is not the full story thing could turn out better than what we have at the middle of our guidance or they could turn out worse and why we give a of revenue guidance especially in an environment this where there a lot of moving piece on with the overall economic situation a pointed out and our backlog visibility is running short a our lead time well go next to with If we at if we back out the effect of the accounting change do you expect your Silicon Valley performance is to be better the same or worse than the rest of your over the next few quarter in term of yearoveryear growth what for in general our assumption when we were basically running our own internal calculation on a potential financial return of acquisition our assumption we build in were in the SVA would continue to lose market share a it had been pre acquisition the after the acquisition we expected we would have it running market neutral possibly le than overall but at least running neutral with the market from a market share standpoint then in the is when we expect it to have it growing faster than the market and consistent with own our expectation is we do if not better Certainly the it lagged the market coming into where again if you more from a resale perspective where it unaffected by the consignment conversion then we would expect we have SVA growing consistent with the overall market also a you point out when you at with conversion there be some it grow at a lower rate than what resale should show and do you have a followon following your announcement of your strategic plan for OMAP and Connectivity do you reckon any of your current OMAP or Connectivity is associated with endoflife buy we have any plan for endoflife buy to support customer on whatever product they want to order and the way well deal with which is typically how well deal with these thing we in the have changed the internal resource focus for other opportunity our portfolio continued to honor whatever customer want on the old product and well continue to do on this a well take our next from with Capital actually have one quick one you tested the end market Where there any end market indiscernible were showing sign with civilization you are not could not hear you If you could maybe pick up your receiver and repeat your Capital you went into the end market or geography talked about wireless but whats on with the end market Are there any are showing sign of worse deceleration or any geography is getting worse or better can walk through it What would is the weakness is broadbased though with a very few exception If we at the industrial market heard from other company have reported a well the industrial market is weak affected revenue especially in area such a Silicon Valley and High Performance from a regional standpoint this show up especially in the and European region Automotive would describe a mixed where sale of automobile so insales continue to grow if you at region China and Europe theyre declining If you at revenue our automotive revenue in Embedded Processing even and our automotive revenue increased a small amount Moving over to wireless infrastructure a we talked about even at the midquarter update revenue weak for a combination of lower purchase by carrier and even adjustment of inventory a a result from OEMs in space a it affect WCDMA continues to dominate the air standard demand overall and played there strongly Although seeing growth and this in some other company report on the LTE side although would spending is a bit volatile or erratic quartertoquarter again we play on both WCDMA a well a LTE a regional standpoint there would China continues to be weak a well a slowdown in the are contributing to the weakness a well If you over in computing no surprise there is a lot of weakness both on the commercial side a well a public spending Dont the impact of Windows the impact tablet are having on cannibalization is our revenue a we sold into space generally weak including in the peripheral space so meaning hard disk drive and printer Probably one area of exception would be in our battery management product revenue actually up in PCs and in notebook charger in both case is due to share gain from a opposed to strength in the market last story would mention would be consumer were seeing seasonal growth being driven by gaming and audio type of product backlog visibility there in especially into the backhalf of is short and we expect to see a seasonal decline again driven by the same area your on the geographic split down Europe down Japan down one area grew Asia and of course Asia is large enough to offset all those other area because about of our revenue ship into Asia Do you have a followon Capital actually do trying to tie back inventory and what were hearing from the industrial for instance Caterpillar is now talking about their dealer reducing inventory how and Ive been also of the view inventory been lean in the channel and maybe wrong a well because now start getting flushed back into the system Does then translate into inventory getting elevated again specifically in area industrial any perspective would be helpful sorry you some of these player are saying their inventory their end product inventory need to be reduced Capital Not any reference specifically referring to Caterpillar which their dealer are reducing inventory something to effect my is inventory been low but now the demand decelerating the way it is it is the week at a risk of getting elevated over the next or so understand me of all when were talking about inventory of course were referring to inventory of component Generally even at our OEMs much le for customer purchased through distributor we have a lot of downstream visibility into their end product and into their inventory To the extent distributor are trying a to stay on top of the demand trend and make inventory adjustment on a realtime so they do not get into an excess situation over the last few quarter heard u talking about distributor inventory holding at about or below week for quarter now and clearly revenue have been shifting around and had a few surprise in environment guess what would is distributor OEM customer ourselves were all trying to keep aligned with end demand to avoid inventory one way or the other Theres a lot of sensitivity there hopefully we do well take final with Capital at your comment about the conversation you started a far a inventory and whats on you do have a high consignment turn you execute to well is your product output lining up with the customer demand a such long can we continue to provide these low lead time before you end up with a mismatch to a forecast drive some extension there our goal would be to do it for an extended of now doesnt always work through but one of the thing you see is were running what day of inventory If you compare back to early believe we were in the mid or so in term of day of inventory we are carrying a different of inventory and part of is because our portfolio changed are much more about standard or catalog product these day where offtheshelf availability is important by the way the risk of inventory is also lower because we have lot of different customer we can sell into with these same product typically these are very longlived product again the risk of carrying inventory is lower would our biggest consideration and protection against what you described a well a keeping our factory prime to go and flexible up or down Do you have a followon Capital guess my followon is looking at those factory and might try to steal followup a well you at your factory in how many shutdown day do we have and is there an expectation to have to keep some shutdown in then my followup is looking at your guidance basically have offered u enough number on the other and the mobile group coming up with about to decline for Embedded Processing and if you were to guide by group Does is computing properly have other than the information we provided for you on wireless have a or to not to break the guidance down segmentbysegment those kind of assumption are what you get paid to do term of shutdown obviously when our utilization go down and run low there are a lot of different method we use to maintain the efficiency of our factory so shutdown and idling and scheduling vacation or holiday time and break are part of what we do have anything to set here and discus publicly in term of how we deal with it other than those are usually part of the mix we end this call me you we have an upcoming investor meeting on at our Silicon Valley facility in Santa Clara California this meeting our manager Brian Crutcher and his management team update investor on our strategy for growth in and our progress if you have not already registered for this meeting please do so or contact u if you need additional information Of course if unable to attend the meeting we have it live and on our me you for joining u of this call is on our today and we do you for your',\n",
       "       'our come from with guess is if you could give any of color at all on where seeing the relative weakness would have caused the operating result to be in toward the lower end it useful to me of walk through where were seeing both positive and negative because they are a bit of a mix although would describe it a most area are tracking a below the middle of our of expectation Wireless is actually doing a better than we had initially expected due to new tablet launch at a of customer use OMAP Of course we still expect overall Wireless revenue to decline a baseband revenue fall from last to about this we explained in term of expectation on baseband back in Outside of Wireless though although we have some product line likely be up and others be down almost all of them are running a weaker than what we had expected back in it should emphasize also most of the weakness were seeing in relative to normal seasonality is what we what began back in and what we had anticipated would continue into for the most part this is continuation of weakness began in with a bit lowerthanexpected across most product area with the exception of Wireless Do you have a followon term of the insurance benefit believe we had one of those last too Are there any more of those we might expect in future quarter we could model in is this the end of fact this is the end of it the we are receiving this be our final proceeds for interruption associated with the Japan earthquake for your record cumulatively we received about in interruption proceeds including this quarter amount again to the Japan earthquake also received about total in property damage and those proceeds are now final a well at least with respect to the Japan earthquake all the insurance proceeds are now behind u next is with Capital Capital guess on the demand picture or the revenue picture being a weaker generally outside of OMAP is a demand issue Is it inventory in the channel can you update u on where inventory stand guess would suggest inventory we believe remains lean Ill specifically about distribution inventory in a minute if you go back to we also allowed at point this potentially could be weaker demand or alternatively it could be customer were taking advantage of short lead time to potentially get order at the last minute guess what would on consideration at this point concluded were operating in a weaker demand environment than would be seasonally normal our progressed some of the demand had initially been scheduled for the month of and August shipment pushed into because we also back in our backlog coverage for and August looked normal from a seasonal standpoint the real mark we had the of where backlog coverage lighter a the progressed some of August backlog in fact pushed out into the of beyond the shifting of backlog and demand between month overall product demand for the also declined a a a minute respect to channel inventory we expect distributor inventory to hold at about flat with where it last which youll recall under week remains lean guess should also note we expect resale from our distribution channel to also be about even flat resale relatively flat absolute inventory then also from a week about the same a where we ended up last Do you have a followon Capital do you comment on whether the right amount of total capacity following the millimeter expansion and National acquisition and your demand commentary update u on utilization lead time and underabsorptionrelated charge not can update you on all of because not can remember all of it me hit on do we have the right amount of capacity interpret from the standpoint of asking if we have too much capacity me although our underutilized capacity on the one hand you can draw a line to margin and it pressuring margin by a few point currently we view the open capacity more from the standpoint a an opportunity to support our future growth and not a a headwind to our financials we were able to buy those asset for penny on the dollar the impact lower utilization is having on our income statement is muted in fact should add we believe the more important consideration is the benefit were seeing to our cash flow a direct result of the opportunistic capacity investment we made over the few year a were now spending well below our historical rate on capital Ill point you specifically if you at the half of this our capital expenditure were below of revenue if you go at our history several point below where we ran even a few year guess back to the margin consideration Ill point out a large part of the impact underutilization on margin are associated with noncash charge such a depreciation margin in our view may not be the best metric when evaluating these capacity investment in the short and at least should be balanced out with the benefit were seeing from a cash flow standpoint took a different direction maybe than what your original but thought it important next come from with you about sort of what area or product you are taking the cost out is the EPS upside evenly split between the insurance proceeds and the lower cost of all would in term of the type of expense reduction would try to draw a line to any product area Think about the expense reduction at this point representing general tightening our control on expense in a more uncertain environment includes minimizing discretionary spending keeping hiring to new college graduate the critical few those type of thing a opposed to product area or reduction then your other tied into guess the EPS the of additional EPS Think about it a about came from the revenue mix benefit so what you described a the higher fallthrough from the insurance then right about of coming from the cost reduction were in the process of implementing Do you have a followon you you about how the booktobill and backlog are trending this u what we should be thinking about a far a normal seasonality term of order trend would order are soft this and likely be down from last a booktobill standpoint a usual well wait until the end of the to comment on then in term of call it average sequential growth the right number to at is if you exclude the we are down on average about and is a average keep in mind down is all coming from the sequential decline in our calculator following the peak backtoschool period Semiconductor revenue and realize we specifically break the product out way but semiconductor revenue historically is flattish to the seasonal decline in calculator pull u down to about a decline again excluding the number next come from with of all can you a bit about the actual end market you all product line were tracking below seasonality or were a bit weaker a far a end market are concerned are you seeing any difference there Not Ill of walk you through them individually but the overview is not Ill start with computing weak essentially on every front with the exception of tablet PCs and associated peripheral are weak there debate whether this is due to delayed purchase associated with Windows or whether it due to displacement by tablet there are a few other theory want to weigh in on Ill why it weak but we are seeing notable weakness in the computing and the space Turning to communication would describe also a generally weak of it is TIspecific of course because our baseband revenue is taking a good stepdown this a we wind down in the final stage of now If you at comms infrastructure revenue likely also decline this and point to maybe different reason is the impact of a carrier in North is in fact slowed down it order would be the economic slump in China is now pushing out infrastructure spending then the is some of our OEM customer are working down some of their excess inventory now consumer we expect our revenue to be subseasonal of example can give television manufacturer the panel manufacturer anyway have now reduced their forecast to a sequential decline theyre pointing to overall economic weakness a well a high inventory level the other hand a bright spot guess is game manufacturer are ramping for the upcoming holiday season and seem to be driving some growth there Automotive we expect our revenue to be about flat then elsewhere industrial would demand is on the weak side Some of certainly is seasonal although there a lot of general caution amongst industrial OEMs a well right Do you have a followon talked about booking potentially being down this so could you also a bit about the linearity of the booking Oh have any view on monthtomonth linearity cant help you on one our next come from with lot of question have been asked but wondering if you had any visibility from a geographic perspective in general on whats well and what is down for you in hard to geographically and again what were what to convey are basically quartertodate and if we extrapolated out for the rest of the were seeing growth in the market Asia about flat with last then decline in Europe and in Japan a well again growth in flat Asia and then decline in Europe and Japan Do you have a followon guess quickly on the connectivity side of thing also down within your Wireless for do expect connectivity to decline correct next come from from USA on the OMAP the strength you mentioned recall the last of quarter you did lose some money in this Do you strength is enough to drive profitability in this if not could you give u an idea what the longerterm strategy for this is so guess what would is considering overall Wireless revenue we expect to decline Keep in mind the OMAP revenue increase be more than offset by the decline were seeing in baseband given the overall revenue be down we would expect the operating loss you saw last to increase somewhat this in general we remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to broaden our base of customer and application for both our OMAP product line a well a our connectivity product in market outside of smartphones and tablet been explaining strategy to go more horizontal into different adjacent market for month or so now were enthusiastic about whats happening outside of smartphones and tablet yet on the other hand have to the smartphone and tablet market become le attractive to u even in the month is being driven by our view is the largest player in market or those market have shown a very strong tendency to vertically integrate the key chip in their system so would obviously were not satisfied with the operating loss we reported last and were to report again this and were in the process of working to reprofile the investment were making in those area about a much a can at this point Do you have a followon USA you the inventory last you the distributor had about week of inventory wondering what you theyll end up with this distribution Somebody asked earlier Distribution inventory we expect to be unchanged with what it last next come from with wondering if you could spend a talking about your view around share buyback in the have announced some large repurchase program did the National deal last and the balance sheet not a strong a it month you share with u how thinking about buyback if go back preNational we were repurchasing plus maybe to per if right we acquired National we took on some debt we explained at we would continue to repurchase but we would moderate our repurchase a we also had some debt to service and repay Since then we had repaid about of the debt in fact about oh a week we went back into the debt market and took on basically amount again another based on the very low rate were to u in the market described and by our coupon rate on we took split between debt where our coupon rate and debt where believe if remember right our coupon rate so those obviously are very attractive rate What we described we would be doing with those proceeds would basically be general corporate purchase including share repurchase the thinking is we would to move our repurchase back to the general level you saw from prior to our acquisition of National Semiconductor in fact if you at in term of authorization remains at the end of the we still had of repurchase authorization remaining from our board hopefully answered your Do you have a followon good color on baseband should we expect to go to by the end of the our expectation is by the we get into baseband revenue be essentially a you see from the trend were well on path so for your question now for our final from Davis ph with Davis is there a merger in division between OMAP chip and the embedded area what we have organizationally is those are separate product line Wireless reporting and our Embedded Processing reporting actually have been combined believe we made an announcement on this somewhere back in the theyve been combined into one organization since the priority for both of those product line area is focused on these horizontal or embedded application market they are all combined meaning microcontrollers DSPs connectivity the OMAP product all within one organization is managed by for transparency reason we have we are continuing to report the Wireless a a separate reporting section Do you have a quick followup you very much for your question before we end tonight call me we have an upcoming investor meeting on in New York focused on drilling down into our strategy for Embedded Processing and Wireless Most of you should have received an invitation but if not please contact u for detail If you havent registered yet please do so a soon a possible Also me you the is on our you and good today call and we appreciate your',\n",
       "       'well go to with term of the utilization rate expecting a you go through the guess would be the followup so then can go away after is is there ever a cost benefit analysis would make to shutter some of the strategic capacity other word if the expectation is it to stay dormant for an extended of would it make to shutter it and then bring it back online when the utilization picked up me start on the utilization in the implicitly we normally forecast implicitly with the revenue guidance being flat and inventory being at desired level about day right now expect our utilization to be up at this stage and in fact it might even decline a bit a we go into the to the on the cost benefit of shutting down strategic capacity you may recall back in we did announce the closure of older factory from a cost benefit standpoint the economics of upgrading or trying to improve those factory to compete with some of the newer factory we brought online didnt pay the decision to go ahead and wind the operation at those factory down one factory in Houston which we expect to close by the middle of next and another factory in Hiji Japan which we expect to close by the end of next well go to with of all looking at the outlook so flat revenue guidance EPS up a bit Sounded you utilization down which might imply margin may be down a bit is the EPS saving here all OpEx or is some of it margin is it a split between the could you give u maybe some color on the driver between for margin and OpEx into for correction purpose at the middle of our guidance our revenue is flat and our EPS is also flat at on a GAAP Performance sound a higher though right because yes because we have an extra of flat GAAP EPS charge well of it more rounding up to a opposed to rounding down to in the Do you have any other guess on then imply sort of margin and OpEx of flattish to what were when you build your model and make the adjustment for various thing we were talking with about let ph margin are to be a bit better have a bit of a better mix we would expect in Recall the seasonality of our calculator for example tends to be the strongest fairly good margin mentioned well see the baseband drop to about coming off of last so the remaining revenue fill in gap slightly higher margin between those thing you see the margin up a bit quarteroverquarter Got it helpful for my followup so you mentioned guess limited visibility in in regard to your customer What of outlook do you actually have baked in right now to your flat guidance and where could this go if you would had a normal a we seem to have a normal and August order right now normal seasonality for u in the is to be up on average seasonality is to be up quarteroverquarter one could if in fact fill out in a more normal fashion we might see growth rate approaching sort of number a mentioned and a been talking about in the press release given the profile of the backlog our customer have scheduled on u we clearly have le demand scheduled in right now than we would normally have at this stage in the and caused u to be cautious on our guidance because were it not apparent to u why is the case Again is it because customer fear their end demand in fact did they increased confidence if their demand go up we have added with inventory we could with ph short lead time next come from with International Strategy a followup on last point or you tell u exactly what your lead time are other word if you did have if you did end up seeing pickup for whats sort of the last date by which customer need to place order so it actually impact your revenue in the guess one way to about it is we mentioned the majority of our product have lead time le than week would certainly and some of go all the way down to if we had instock inventory certainly would indicate by the we get to our midquarter update in well have certainly better visibility a to what the of should be looking at point Do you have a followon did then along the same line any clearly order were significantly weaker than you might have expected Has there been any pickup or stabilization in then there any difference in the profile of order you for example from the distributor versus your OEMs x your wireless OEMs Ill answer the part and Ill you handle the part if you remember it term of the rate of new order in is consistent with what we saw in the of we havent a pickup but we also havent a further slowdown our guidance comprehend those order trend a to relates to the distribution channel for example what we saw in the distributor resale actually increased quarteroverquarter to about the same rate of total sale consistent their inventory dropped about a day they continue to ph hold very lean level of inventory which suggest to u similar to our OEM customer theyre holding only a much inventory a they feel they need to have for a relatively short window of week a mentioned it go back to what saying earlier our customer across the board seemed to be carrying very lean inventory expecting u to be able to meet very short lead time which we presently have so we should have better insight a to what their final demand be in the when we get to the midquarter update come from with quickly on the Wireless profitability for the would have thought with a better mix of baseband op profit would have been a bit better wonder if you could help me understand whats on there and importantly x baseband whats the breakeven op profit revenue you need to see for breakeven op profit of in the OMAP and the Connectivity the biggest driving the profitability or quite frankly the lack of profitability right now in Wireless is the revenue is a revenuedependent we talked about for a while Theres a large RD built on a they develop new product for the end market theyre aiming at and it been one requires more revenue than it obviously to absorb much RD clearly our attention something were looking closely into it relates to a breakeven number would you back in revenue at turned in actually above breakeven at point in if you adjust it for baseband your best reference point wont try to forecast you well from our conversation here in the recent were looking at the opportunity for to expand product offering into the embedded processing space and clearly have a different profile of need a we get all timing worked out to make heard right saying of last the nonbaseband part of Wireless turned a profit a small profit and would be the closest proxy quickly you talked about baseband being down to in the relative to of your midpoint of flat revenue are there any broader revenue bucket are outperforming or underperforming you can to is everything coming in of flattish would for the most part flattish and we break the guidance down too much by product area a mentioned clearly there a seasonal trend where our calculator tends to grow compared to we would expect of course to occur and be and it largely offset the decline in baseband then outside of certainly collectively flattish but generally flattish by product area a well next is with to follow up a bit on the Wireless group Are the RD cut in the half are those all aimed at Wireless then is there some sort of line to where we can tell let if Wireless isnt profitable by of next then there could be some change there what are the option if Wireless not become profitable within a to of changing the anybody anything about cut in the half what we talked about we are looking at how to best align the resource to meet the changing market opportunity we see for those product especially embedded processing space can include also reallocating resource to other area with better growth opportunity have any number for you with specificity a to what a breakeven or how much may take and so on all with a we decide what the appropriate action are if any one of the thing referencing the fact we lowered the guidance of more a anticipated growth we had planned overall in RD not be in the plan or wont be occurring now for the most part if we hold half quarterly run rate consistent with where we were in the then we would be rounding down guidance we gave for the full Do you have a followon Real quick on SVA it flat and the rest of your up Was there anything on there do you have any outlook on SVA versus the sort of the core for the half or at least there is some stuff on with respect to SVA but tied more to and Youll recall in those quarter we were talking about we had made some distributor change in we had eliminated one of their traditional distributor and then brought on brought them onto additional distributor had previously supported in the which resulted in some inventory adjustment in the channel about for SVA benefited from some channel fill with inventory and therefore the comparison is a more complex or unfavorable than into the only difference If you from a resale perspective SVA resale were very consistent with what you saw or what we described for the rest of again it more noise associated with the change and with respect to distributor there an additional part of the next come from with is during the midquarter update you talked about wireless infrastructure or comm infrastructure and automotive actually holding up you elaborate a bit on comment now the way you see thing now is there any market at all could potentially be up in the can about the comms infrastructure automotive we ended up from a sequential standpoint with being down slightly so shifted a bit during the of from our prior expectation comms infrastructure had very strong sequential growth in the it more of what described previously which is in the North market there is a very aggressive build continuing to take place a carrier try to stay up with consumer demand for data so with everybody having smartphones and tablet consuming lot of data the carrier under a lot of pressure to be able to stay up with demand the strength of our position across almost all of the equipment manufacturer were a prime beneficiary of again it you can LTE is starting to into play a bit but this is mostly being driven by WCDMA build here in the North market see trend on a secular continuing although once we get towards the end of this youll see more of the carrier spends start to shift to small cell Macro doesnt go away of course because those base station are still required on the other hand a bigger part of the carrier spending likely begin to shift towards small cell where we have an extremely strong position with our systemonachip and we to again start here in the North market it already begun in some market Korea start here in North late this and we well ramp nicely from there again a good secular trend for u there ongoing in the automotive space the only would is market a you might expect with economic uncertainty consumer expressing more concern on where they spend their money especially on large purchase automotive were starting to see some of a well a assume other player a well Do you have a followon for the RD coming down a bit for the is sort of a a response to the environment have you some consolidation program trying to understand where coming from a bit of response to the environment but it also on a lowered outlook some variable compensation for example would be le than it otherwise would have been it a combination of some temporary and of permanent adjustment permanent if you is the expected variable compensation be a bit le than previously planned and some of the permanent is realigning some of the program we had under way well go to Glenn with ask a bit about the order linearity between and it sound very bad but is back to normal seasonal my suspicion is more about than in your response can you also describe what exactly happened in me make you didnt misunderstand what before Glenn in term of new order coming in is about the same we saw in so it hasnt picked up nor it slowed down What did is our backlog coverage meaning order are scheduled to ship in the of look typical in term of new order they fell from to and is running at about the same call it daily run rate we felt for the of overall not a change one direction or the other again it a combination of what we saw in the of a well a what to date in led u to give the subseasonal guidance we provided Do you have a followon Glenn sort of a part of what exactly did you see in Was there any sort of pattern in term of geography getting weak or end market getting weak it everything across the board would broadbased mean there were some market shifted maybe a bit more than others so much from an order standpoint this is a different twist on your but from a revenue standpoint me of walk through the regional result North American market from a sequential growth standpoint strongest followed by Asia followed by Japan and then Europe actually the only region down a bit midquarter update believe described at point we were expecting some growth out of Europe at least from a revenue standpoint there a bit more of a downshift in Europe Probably no real surprise there is there anything jump to your mind from a productline standpoint or from an endmarket standpoint would describe it a more broadbased Glenn a opposed to any particular area of weakness pronounced would agree If you across the whole you could most of the end market were up a bit Auto and TV were down a bit a mentioned earlier the industrial space it about flat on a quartertoquarter of the mix we saw in the major market Glenn describing a and on your list and you still have number coming if still there do you have a a very very simple one Do you happen to what utilization rate were in the answer to is also very simple we do not disclose specifically what our utilization is our utilization overall up slightly to compared with Similarly the utilization the underutilization charge were therefore down a bit frankly a we into the of and saw order fall off we changed our loading we pulled back on our loading a a result the underutilization expense did not fall quite a much a we had expected which you see in the margin which frankly not quite a strong a we had expected in the a well next come from with to keep pushing on this Wireless a bit the of last you had a big highprofile tablet win helped OMAP and have down x baseband had Wireless down a of hundred from in the last of quarter may be wrong on those number do you have the type of OMAP opportunity in the next quarter can get you back to is this more of a of waiting for the embedded to fill in those gap to get back to it a bit of both mean clearly in the tablet space we have other customer win you can assume be ramping into production using new product new OMAP product from before the end of the where those go in term of actual success in the marketplace is still to be determined clearly there opportunity there at the same a heard u now for several quarter were not resting waiting for the tablet or smartphone space to carry u are rapidly pursuing opportunity in the embedded space and more horizontal opportunity outside of smartphones and tablet and those are showing good traction a well there clearly opportunity for growth in smartphones and tablet a well Do you have a followon Windows on OMAP in the wake of of Microsoft Surface coming out with their own Windows tablet on a competitor ARM chip whats your customer interest in continuing to pursue market is still a big or is it a big investment for you is an area were pursuing have win RT ported over to our OMAP architecture and we have opportunity not in the tablet space but also in some of the embedded opportunity were pursuing a well a lot of those embedded opportunity are to be looking for highlevel operating system to run on our application processor the fact we have the broadest coverage of any application processor in term of highlevel operating system are ported and running on our chip is differentiation for and open a lot of door for u in term of the customer enthusiasm cant speak for the customer other than to we are still we see a lot of activity with those customer in term of preparing to launch their own product we assume their enthusiasm is unabated and well see where it go next come from Wang with Partners Wang Partners you talked about Europe softening since you gave the midquarter update stabilization in area and mean whats your latest read on not following your a stabilization in Europe saying Wang Partners when you relative to your midquarter update the one geography seems to have softened a bit wasnt necessarily surprising Europe with your more typical of if thing have stabilized there and you are looking for more construction type of trend is still an area where it still softening it too early to tell Recall in Europe it customary many of the business there take mass vacation during the summer month especially in August so typically you actually see much resumption of meaningful demand in the from Europe until you get to the end of August it too early for u to comment on yet Do you have a followon Wang Partners you do it about margin If we at margin here it sound you are guiding margin up slightly here in the a we into the back half into next what are some of the structural thing we should be thinking about in term of getting the margin back into the low to mid the most apparent one is revenue growth been talking about we did bring in bring on quite a bit of capacity during the last of year we bought for literally penny on the dollar even though it inexpensive nonetheless it still contribute to our underutilization charge in the quarter clearly the most meaningful way for u to improve margin is simply to continue growing our revenue so we can absorb underutilization and it fall through to margin addition to well see a continuation of improvement of mix we talked about earlier baseband drop to about we in the still expect to wind down to essentially a we begin be replaced revenue replaces tends to have higher margin therell be a bit of mix there but the biggest driver to point to is revenue growth to absorb the underutilization next come from with Capital Capital in the you have been able to offer some color on whats on in the market specifically the disk drive market a lot of movement this you give u an update on what seeing right now guess what would is we saw some growth in disk drive in the there still some residual recovery from the Thailand flooding certainly out of the we is now fully recovered view overall is the hard disk drive TAM appears to be softening somewhat though very well could be the mix of the type of computing platform are shipping many of those not using a hard disk drive Theyre using solidstate memory at this point other than described at the midquarter we had some mixed signal in the space between maybe similar to what were seeing with product battery management et cetera and what we are seeing with hard disk drive still held through the end of the Do you have a followon Capital if you could could you give u an update on how the progress of your recent or notsorecent acquisition the CICLON Luminary you commented on Silicon Valley already If you could go back a further and highlight how well those business are working within your portfolio you may recall if others were listening CICLON supporting the power strategy and mild indication turned out to be quite an effective acquisition and contributing nicely to the growth in power space Luminary an acquisition went into our Embedded Processing side of the house and gave u a capability in the bit microcontrollers we previously didnt have a strong footprint in were learning a lot in space simply a lot more to a lot more opportunity a lot more growth to do there clearly brought a lot of knowledge to u filled in some gap we didnt previously have inhouse next come from with of wanted to ask about underutilization charge especially what is is mostly a cash charge Is a noncash charge would there necessarily be an uptick in margin if you were to conceptually shutter or or whatever of capacity the is what is the cash drag from these underutilization charge the underutilization charge there a bit of cash there but these are mostly noncash Youre talking about asset are depreciated or not being used These are mostly noncash Theres to be some cash because keeping of course underloaded clean room open so still using utility and some gas and so on to keep those but minimal it relates to opportunity when we described in we were closing of our older factory the one in Houston and the one in Hiji Japan what we talked about is once those factory were closed they should save u about in cost on an annual once done so it by the end of those are the of number you can about in this area Do you have a followon wondering why your operating margin in the embedded side have lagged Is it mix Is it more because of the wireless infrastructure not doing so well your margin seemed to have recovered somewhat to the mid but the embedded operating margin are down substantially yearonyear what on now yearonyear revenue down also If recall let take a here real quick revenue down about yearoveryear underlying RD and support cost are still there and revenue down so to take your margin down in the itself it a bit below what we had expected and being driven by some new product startup and some inventory scrappage occurred in in the come from with Ill pick up on last we at embedded profitability how should we about the rate of growth in profitability the rate of growth in revenue indiscernible is it or are there any project you have you were fading out there asking question about how to about the rate of growth in Embedded Processing Embedded Processing rate of growth of profitability versus revenue Similar to we would expect the Embedded Processing space to grow of at historical average which would be in the of over fact if you take a the Embedded Processing and where were aimed at at the bit and bit those are growing a bit faster than the bit portion of Embedded Processing you might see something compound a bit faster than over from a market standpoint of course our stated objective are to grow faster than our market and we put the resource down to do with the operating expense being all thing being equal being fairly stable any growth in revenue should fall through quickly and improve profitability you would expect growth in revenue to occur at a certain pace Growth in profitability occur at a faster pace because it falling through without too much incremental operating expenditure Do you have a followon the followup we talked a lot about reduction of RD expense for this What about selling general and administrative Should we expect to be lower than the trajectory you were looking at in the half the general and administrative cost we already have action under way we talked about when we acquired and closed on the National Semiconductor acquisition may recall we talked about by the end of the of acquisition to be sometime in the we be removing redundant cost between the company such we should have about of annualized saving after the end of the actually making good progress on front may or may not be aware but back when we closed on the National acquisition we put some pro forma PLs out on the welcome to go take a at help you see what the company would have looked had they historically been combined if you go take a at those youd find it somewhat insightful to take a at and compare to our most recent and youll see were already beginning to see some of the cost synergy of those the merger of company coming together showing up in those result and do you happen to have a number on how SGA compare yearonyear look the combined SGA for the company on a pro forma last would have been about and in it at running about better on a yearoveryear next come from with ask a one quick clarification from what you at the ahead of where you were before Is fair to then you have more and then at your total with the synergy would expect to get the rest of it over the next few month yes whats coming down there recall on our way there were having to spend a leap ph to save a so to speak other word integrating the system caused u to take on incremental cost to get there it safe to we can see on the radar well deliver of annualized saving by the end of the guess a my hopefully main on the disty inventory side of thing whats your assumption from what the channel inventorywise in your guidance we may have some assumption but we publicize those given distributor do what they feel they need to do based on their own view of customer demand usually well try to provide some insight in the midquarter update but not this early a to what we expect those trend to be be your and you still get another one Calculators you mentioned is a positive outlier for the you give u an idea how big in the Did it go up it typical whatever it how much it typically rise in the typical and trying to remember what typical is Hang on a me see did increase about or so versus it customarily go up close to the amount of decrease were to see in baseband in to baseband about in and we expect it to drop to about not far off what we would typically see the calculator go up from to to type of increase in calculator typically next come from with wanted to take a step back with respect to the guidance typically if we in the and were seeing a subseasonal it typically because there some inventory to burn in the channel you at the seasonal business imagine there still some seasonal build on more muted than normal If were to get towards the low end of your guidance would actually imply somewhat of a seasonal decline sequential decline you help me to get there What potentially could drive Is there still some inventory burn on in the channel Perhaps there something on with pricing or something maybe the nonseasonal market segment make a of point mean inventory are low already this is not a case where in a lot of inventory built and now there potential need to replenish not the situation we see what happened in the growth came about not inventory replenishment but simply customer for the most part no longer reducing inventory so therefore our shipment necessarily needed to start moving back up to the rate at which the customer were producing their own product not inventory build but rather the end of inventory depletion you can see a distribution channel at even at week of inventory which it been for the last of last few quarter low already and yet they did manage to take it down another day a we mentioned in the again our scenario the downside case or the lower end of the case to do with inventory burning it more to do with if the macro environment weakens and customer take their own production rate down or down from what they are currently expecting could into play of course the upper end of the would reflect customer havent filled in the order havent placed those order yet because they didnt need to based on where lead time were so would drive the upside case middle of the case is of what we see in our backlog now not making a lot of assumption we get additional fillin during the of hopefully help Do you have a followon mean a a followup on then embedded in your guidance assuming the midpoint of the then is it fair to assume sort of customer inventory and distributor inventory would be relatively flat quarteroverquarter in dollar Boy it of what saying before we guess to some degree may be the case in were not seeing sign of in the form of backlog sign of a ramp during the of you might more typically expect given the upcoming holiday guess you would at the middle of the there the assumption of flattish inventory we put a lot of assumption about customer distributor inventory into guidance more so than thinking about overall demand go next to with you about OMAP a a percentage of Wireless in the what the magnitude of the sequential decline and whether you expect some rebound in OMAP half overall is running about of the nonbaseband revenue in other word OMAP plus Connectivity of a a split with OMAP being of revenue and being Connectivity from there you can get close in term of what those trend were clearly the decline driven from OMAP Connectivity down but would describe it down a small amount compared to OMAP Do you have a followon you give u sort of based on your pricing strategy for SVA in term of your target of getting back to the core growth you have in your for SVA the Silicon Valley yes mean their pricing strategy is to be consistent with own pricing strategy in the catalog space it High Performance and some of the a good part of the power product line which is we want to be competitive in term of pricing but at the same those market you tend to sell into not always but a lot of relatively lowvolume application where the focus from the customer perspective is much more on the product specification the performance characteristic of the product a opposed to price These product in general tend to be relatively lowpriced product meaning le than type of ASP so a a percentage of the customer bill of material it represents a small amount customer for these product tend not to be hypersensitive on price Theyre more focused on getting the right type of product with the strength of the product line and portfolio SVA the product the focus is much more on getting the word out getting the support out to a much broader of customer making of course were competitive on price certainly not to go out and not become try to position the product line so it not competitive frankly part of the issue in term of revenue growth before reaching for higher level of margin sometimes the pricing out of National not competitive in the marketplace you saw their market share loss a a result the strategy shift is make competitive but again make were winning product based on performance and support consideration a opposed to pricing next come from with looking at your sale guidance this it seems a lot a bit worse than what some other company have reported thus far in at Intel they guided up which is a of point worse than what they normally do in Xilinx if you at their core being down a of percent also maybe or point worse than what they normally do in flat it about to point below what you normally do of what is it about this environment hurting you a bit more might get of all Intel a different type of seasonal pattern They certainly are much more narrower in term of their end market exposure not we can do much of a direct comparison there then similarly Xilinx if we were looking at our comms infrastructure trend they might be different than what we see for overall clearly theyre to have much stronger part of their mix tied to comms infrastructure of all the company at least one named our exposure is much broader than any of them the point is we are operating in a more uncertain environment a this is a not of the backlog painting a very clear story and it a negative story is more a of we have all the backlog visibility we would normally have so in type of environment and a lot from what Ive with other company is not unique to suspect there different mean by which different management team choose to extrapolate what they see so given you what given you explained the for it and what done and guess need to you sort it out in term of how compare to our other semiconductor peer do you have a followon Does the fact being to point below seasonal have any bearing on how you about the and the quarter too early for at this might also add to you there still one of the thing even if we did have a seasonal growth we still have a unwind of baseband on the sequential headwind to if you adjust for it might not be down quite a sharply a you although it is still down versus what our seasonal number might suggest seasonal number of actually is x baseband and refitted for the inclusion of National me also a we before if this market want to lift on u versus the guidance provided for or frankly even into we have inventory position we have manufacturing capacity youll find our ability to flex up and support higher of demand should it arise flexibility is high we need to at least overly stress about what the outlook into work it a it come towards u final come from with talked about in the about how with Silicon Valley a bigger sale team and more field presence Are you seeing any effect of this on design win for the Silicon Valley product if so do you expect the growth of the SVA division to actually accelerate your other division at some point in the future a reasonable expectation you are implying in your right now it more measured in customer interest and in design win and those then be precursor to actual revenue growth occur later long our assumption coming into this acquisition the share loss National had experienced preacquisition likely would continue into the of the acquisition and then we would hope to have the revenue stabilized and running consistent with the market then for the next and then in basically have it trending faster than the market consistent with our own growth would imply over the next of year you could see a faster acceleration in SVA growth compared to own revenue a it coming of from a hole to moving consistent with our own revenue growth Ill also those assumption talked about were what we built into our financial return and financial assessment on the acquisition internal goal of course are much more aggressive than and were confident at this point based on traction with customer the interest with customer the designin rate were to be able to do better than well report it a it come Do you have a followon EPS guidance assume any improvement in margin in the if so is this mixrelated is there some other factor help margin we mentioned early on in the call there some improvement there given the EPS is about flat quarteroverquarter Revenue is about flat quarteroverquarter at the midpoint there a bit of improvement in there we could see a winddown in the baseband a lower margin being replaced by the calculator at higher margin you your question and all of you for joining u of this call is on our today call you all for your',\n",
       "       'our come from with of in the last few week we have a number of macro indicator starting to get softer but you are maintaining the midpoint of your outlook have you noticed any change versus your prior expectation whether it be by regional or product or end market perspective color you could provide would be very helpful you for your guess what would is a you might imagine given what we did in term of maintaining or narrowing our guidance around the prior middle of the our is generally tracking well and consistent with our initial expectation do expect solid sequential growth in our in our Embedded Processing a well a our other segment while we expect Wireless decline an end market standpoint the industrial market we began to see some early indicator of recovery in the continues to recover in the Although would describe visibility there continues to remain low Probably in term of notable strength Communications Infrastructure we expect be up strongly this but even so not back to the level we saw in of Now another major market worthy of mention would be Computing where would describe sale in the computing application are somewhat mixed then of our sale of storage product in the hard disk drive customer we expect to grow again this this we believe thing have back into sync in term of our shipment have are reflecting a fully recovered situation in Thailand from flooding situation Do you have a followon would you characterize inventory both at your site and at your distributor a good a different than in the in distribution we would describe inventory is low fact would extend to customer in general Youll recall for the last of quarter described distributor inventory is about week and again is low by our historical standard what noticed is both distributor and customer are reluctant to build inventory given of your which tight uncertainty in the overall macro environment term of own inventory a you saw last we are well positioned with our inventory and we maintain position strength in term of inventory also extend to were well positioned with manufacturing capacity to support whatever demand situation develops if demand were to suddenly strengthen which is often the case in an upturn situation were we believe were to benefit from the strong inventory situation we have If the recovery build more slowly in case our inventory is mostly comprised of what would describe a longlived catalog product and our risk there is low in short the upside opportunity more than justifies the downside risk you for your question go next to with could you a about linearity either by booking or billing or both have of the monthbymonth or guess the call it with a weekbyweek linearity Most quarter for this the last of the tends to be our strongest even so typically the last well be still in the upper a a percent of revenue in the but and so this would be no exception with this guidance expect any of a heroic act in the of more of a normal type of build in final of the Do you have a followon do mentioned Communications should be up strongly in the you maybe add a bit more color in there maybe specifically talking about wireless versus wireline Most of our Communications Infrastructure revenue and exposure is to wireless base station so it would be to then down of it the North American market and deployment of WCDMA infrastructure is whats driving it of more of the same of what over the last of year where North developed market in general and North specifically a service provider are adding data capacity to try to keep up with demand from consumer arising from the broad deployment both of smartphones a well a tablet we had a bit of what Ill call a glitch back late last with some of the operator putting on tapping on the brake but it seems were out of mode and back into growth again you well move to the next go next to with how much of the low inventory level at distribution is a function of your move more toward consignment a well a the canceling of the one distribution contract from Nat Semi Some of it is consignment If you at certainly if you at back multiple year of history you would were down a good of week versus where we wouldve been year because of the consignment programming then again we have about or so of our distribution revenue now being supported by a consignment inventory program when about week is low by historical standard making the adjustment already to comprehend the consignment program certainly down partly because of consignment but even comprehending what you would expect from a consignment program in term of reduction of the distributorowned inventory were low by those adjusted standard a well Do you have a followon do wondering if you could give u a bit of your thought on the departure of Lowe obviously is pursuing an opportunity he belief be in his best interest is a great manager a great leader He wellrespected at we wish him the best Not we wish him too much best because obviously were competing with him at Freescale he a good man and suspect hell do well there you for your question well move to the next go next to with last you commented your booktobill is tracking above so far you give u comment on how booktobill is tracking so far Have you any change or fluctuation in booking for next Youre right Booktobill positive last what prefer to do instead of talking about booktobill because it tends to be very noisy with both the numerator and denominator changing me a usual wait till the end of the to specifically comment on booktobill and maybe describe more what were seeing in term of order what would on order is theyre trending well this a we saw last and we expect both order and backlog to grow based upon what during the month of the here do you have a followon you give u any progress or update on how the SVA is doing versus your overall SVA we continue to be encouraged with the progress there but would rather wait till the end of the to start getting into the various subset of everything in term of the integration of National Semiconductor the customer response to integration sorry the customer response to the acquisition and integration of of our continues to be very encouraging to u green light there but in term of revenue trend and relative to the rest of the Ill wait till the end of the let move to the next next come from with mentioned the Wireless be down you give u a more color Is because of the baseband side OMAP connectivity color on would be appreciated Baseband we would expect to be about even with what we saw last Youll recall earlier in the or maybe late last we described we expect it be running about to per in general this so well within but about even with where we were last remainder of the Wireless revenue we expect decline this tied to customer completing their inventory correction we described last and also a they prepare for new model launch later this and basically cleaning out inventory in anticipation of those new phone model Do you have a followon do back to the distribution side of thing rather than the inventory answered already what about on the demand side are you seeing demand from used versus your OEM customer Not dissimilar on either front we expect resale from the distribution channel increase not exactly the same a what were expecting overall but within striking distance anyway in general similar you well move to the next go next to with Capital guess a you about your conversation in the last few week how have thing changed if at all given what were seeing in term of the macro backdrop have a lot more to in term of the last of week other than what previously which is obviously part of our growth is tied to u believe over the last over to last what starting of last continuing through of this our customer were through an inventory correction therefore we were undershipping their demand What were seeing in the is begun the process of moving back toward their end demand the reality is we could have mean the macro matter and demand matter but it can wobble a bit and not affect our nearterm growth a we continue to recover from correction it can impact a slope can impact our customer motivation to replenish inventory which again we believe happened at all to this stage coming out of the correction a opposed to any replenishment to date this is tracking generally consistent with what we had expected back in when we gave our initial guidance Do you have a followon Capital real quickly the Embedded can you share whether is tracking in line with the overall guide here in or above or below any color there would be great would Embedded is growing in term of versus the guidance not to get into all detail keep in mind in the of Embedded a big piece of is Comms Infrastructure which described a doing very well this Also growing of is the broaderbased catalog product line Embedded overall is doing very well mostly driven by Comms Infrastructure and again also driven by catalog you well move to the next go next to with had commented you believe customer are rebuilding any inventory this Do you they are all the way toward ordering back in line with their demand other word do you need demand improvement in the to drive further revenue growth could you see some incremental catchup from customer continuing to order back the demand Boy a tough one even at our analyst meeting we described we believe the industry overall lagging call it historical trend the extrapolation of trend by about coming out of Now you and you might assume trend line is a rough proxy for end demand but obviously it not to be a perfect proxy Ill hold off on making any extension on whether we still be able to benefit from in the movement back toward end demand in until we finish this and are ready to give guidance for Do you have a followon assuming the answer is no given your comment about this inventory and capacity but wanted to check to see if lead time have stretched out at all yet or of have stable lead time are still short with the strong majority below week given what done in term of manufacturing capacity and given what done in term of inventory we be able to maintain those lead time at those currently attractive level Now it also what typically happens at a we move through an upturn is it doesnt take our lead time extending it take is for anybody in our customer supply chain to start extending lead time for the customer to then move to next phase of the upturn which is basically replenishing inventory versus trying to maintain low level of inventory again what we have not yet but again were not the fact our lead time are short and are expected to remain short by no mean limit our ability to benefit from next phase of the cycle fact it the exact opposite the fact we have product availability a customer start to replenish inventory and put pressure on other part of the supply chain we would actually hope to be able to pick up share a we move through process for your question move to the next well go next to with you about the direction of your fab utilization a you a you move through this you mentioned being happy with the current of inventory Do you you need to keep flat how are you thinking about those thing Utilization this likely be about the same on average a what we had last in term of our inventory guess the best way to describe it would be from a day standpoint on inventory day we would expect were to land flat maybe even down a a our revenue increase this obviously were keeping our inventory well positioned to support future growth Do you have a followon you about what seeing in the automotive space mean it been fairly recent but had some weaker data point on end demand in the Do you youll see if you did see it over what frame would you see it have any data on automotive been a market been driving a lot of growth even over the few quarter we would expect it to do well but it not if at Embedded Processing Comms Infrastructure and the catalog product area are the one are driving the growth this automotive maintaining the strength over the last few quarter Not giving any of back but again not the driver of Embedded Processing growth this particular believe your followup move to the next go next to with Capital apologize if you already addressed this Geographically what are you seeing in the did not address what would is based on of where what done in the of quarter or month of the growth been led by the followed by Asia and Europe Japan is the only region a sequential decline in the again followed by Asia and Europe with a small decline in Japan this Do you have a followon Capital is a bit different than it been in the few year so normal pattern for What should we be looking at is a good because our profile changed with the inclusion of National our SVA and also a Baseband declined and obviously it had strong seasonal pattern on it own if you adjust out to add in Silicon Valley and take out Baseband Ill give you on average would be up if the if you at our guidance and you make the adjustment for the insurance proceeds were in the revenue line for youll see this is above Right around believe is the middle of our guidance were well aligned with the seasonal average Ill go ahead and give you the rest of the if you would so we can do this once then would be on average would decline and Ill have to put an asterisk on includes If you exclude it would be down then rolling over to the average is down for again highly impacted by If you take one out of average would be flat seasonally to do you believe your followon well move to the next well go next to with an obvious but given hit the midpoint reaffirming the midpoint of your guidance whats the pattern of your sale through the up to now much have you expected mean you exit this on a high didnt understand everything you you repeat your with the National ph through the various month of this much a you expected mean each been stronger than the last and you expect to be the strongest so you exit the significantly higher than you started the in term of progress so a about linearity expectation is be the strongest of the which is much the case every Ill reiterate what before so there no confusion Typically the final of the for run in the upper a a percentage of the total quarter revenue and so it is not a disproportionately strong part of even to do with when we book royalty and such in the final of the a opposed to in the earlier month we expect this to be much every other which is a strong relative to and but not stronger than wouldbe typical in a we out of the with off of the strongest but doesnt imply necessarily anything about into the Do you have a followon guess related to order momentum grown through the want to about momentum per se because get into more complex math than may be even capable of doing but what is order be up we have order and backlog are growing a we did last go next to with Parag Agarwal is Parag for wondering if you could provide any update on your Windows ARM program Like there were a lot of demo in Computex update on front be very helpful you Parag and at Computex last week many of you may have noted Toshiba announced their Windows roadmap including Windows RT device are theyre working with OMAP to develop They announced a roadmap for a clamshell a well a a tablet again in both case theyre working with Separately we demoed our we had our own demonstration which showed Windows RT running on an OMAP at same show most saw it had some good thing to in term of the performance of operating system on OMAP Do you have a followon Parag Parag Agarwal for the timing and the revenue part from this for this concern when should we expect any revenue from this program Parag want to try to get out ahead of our customer in term of or announcement of product and when they might ramp incrementally what came out of show in fact and Toshiba are working together and then also were far along in term of porting technology over to OMAP have any forecast to provide separate from what Toshiba might on their product plan and with let wrap up we end the call me you the is on our you and good concludes today call Have a wonderful day',\n",
       "       'go to with you help u walk through the margin assumption here if back out the insurance proceeds getting a margin for do walk through to the guidance for getting there and not if doing right doing right in the direction directionally it correct you should be seeing margin up by the way you your computation correct when you adjust for the insurance about without the insurance so generally speaking we expect to increase a we move into talked about starting up the factory a bit more higher utilization benefit should early in the not what share count using but directionally moving in the right direction maybe a a followup to might have expected to see more can you walk through some of the mechanic there Is there shouldnt we be seeing more leverage in the margin or is it more am missing something here a bit Glenn directionally moving in the right direction Again how you built up your model but would see our margin being a bit higher than what you have built in your model so far go to with guess a of thing maybe If could start in the other wireless category one of the sort of backandforths over the year been what happen to connectivity a the baseband of fall off baseband we all knew about Other a weaker this too Is there any way to how much of the market or is the customer exposure being a bit softer versus any impact from of the basebands pulling the connectivity along with it or sorry would there any direct tie to the baseband guess could there an indirect tie in we sell connectivity product to some of the same customer where we sell baseband to the extent those customer is not particularly strong a you see both on the baseband line a well a would show up on some of the connectivity demand product demand for some of our connectivity product also then we also have separately customer use connectivity product do not use our baseband product in some of those case also decline a well totally independent in case of the baseband guess of bigger picture and this is something had been asked on the midquarter update historically you have done very well hitting the number last few quarter it been a lot tougher we were in a downturn and sometimes it tough to get in front of a you back on a number of quarterly miss in a row do you about approaching guidance any differently or you there do you of back on it and it a tough downturn but it over and the way of rolled up the model historically is how were to do it or were there any change made would the short answer is well continue to do what we have been doing a tough downturn also complicated by the fact we were frankly executing on the largest acquisition tried to take over in the so behind u now were moving use the same model and approach we have to forecast our outlook go to with wanted to ask a bit again about the Core Wireless with the baseband now finally rolling off were back to negative operating margin in wireless you give u some feeling what of revenue in Core Wireless you actually you need for at least to break even and where those margin can maybe go over also wondering from margin standpoint it actually make to be in this at all Are you to drive enough upside a you move it into more of the Embedded to make up for any of the wireless shortfall or is not some sort of a capitulation a moving out of smartphones and tablet Ill take part of and help out on some of it too If you back a recently a the last and do your math youd see in fact the Core Wireless actually did make a profit it ability to generate a profit is certainly already proven by the historical result a evidenced by the baseband wasnt it driving most of even if you extract youd to the same conclusion Core Wireless made a profit far a the margin are concerned talked about in the the margin in nonbaseband portion certainly not a rich a what you would see over in or even in better processing space but still quite attractive real focus in area at this point is clearly were spending enough to be able to develop the product we need What team is heavily focused on now is driving the revenue growth and taking it beyond a single source mentioned in his opening remark where the diversity of our customer is such we would expect le impact to the on single market or single large customer and wireless following through on a similar strategy where they are trying to deliver the technology from their nonbaseband product into adjacent market can give u more diversity both of market and customer those include space such a automotive and certain other application theyve gained some interest and traction on here recently the focus there is now on driving the top line Theres certainly enough spending already in place to be able to meet the RD requirement to add so about higher revenue in those core area you asked what of revenue it take the recent data point a those core product were profitable at the operating margin last were nipping on profitability we need revenue be sustained certainly what were doing in these embedded area by no mean do we consider capitulation but actually a mean by which we can further enhance revenue on what should be a basically leverage the investment already made for smartphones and tablet and be able to go reach into some of these other market segment a well did actually have a followup on point how long it take to actually ramp meaningful revenue in those other of market Whats the sort of guess design in lifetime long it take to win design and how long it take before we can expect to see meaningful revenue coming out of those is there any sort of incremental investment need to happen if you your OpEx in these market is at comfortable level to drive Boy there were a bunch of question there the core how long it take to drive meaningful revenue in these other area guess what would is it take a while is not something in some of these other area where the product life can be very long design in aspect of them tends to be a longer than some of the highvolume vertical is a well we expect this is not a strategy to go address thing over the next to quarter is something we build on what we have over we increase the diversity and therefore the stability of revenue mix you can comment but we believe the investment we have take u into these new space is not a big incremental investment to be able to go drive these product into new area mean about the biggest infrastructure investment is the sale force which is already in place by the way the biggest competitive advantage we likely have a well mean clearly we have to have the right product Once you have the right product you have to be able to have the right reach into the customer base and the sale force in place it not a big incremental RD spend to go somehow develop new product or different product for these other adjacent market would add to Rons comment there this isnt something the wireless team had started is to be adjacent market already talked about he talked about it recently in Barcelona his team been looking at these adjacent market for some now and have over customer engagement already already began to gain traction but a say we expect each of those market is such it take a while to see the revenue build from a cost standpoint tell you he investing adequately now to meet growth go to with want to make understand the embedded sorry on side of the revenue essentially flat Sequential operating profit down about Was all due to the Spansion help me understand is now a continuous headwind around utilization or help me understand the Spansion capacity the capacity being used for Spansion currently is underutilized now wound up so is clearly allocated into the and clearly is a drag in addition flat revenue in some of the other business also had seasonally higher paying benefit increase began in you had the GPM drag mentioned a a result of the utilization but you also have higher OpEx a revenue build there it be able to absorb fine over the next of quarter then a a followon now you have National a part of the fold wonder if you could recenter me a far a the percent of your being done through distribution Whats sellin versus sellthrough then on the sellin front relative to your helping strategy what percent of the sellin of act sellthrough do you what were seeing here is inventory restocking or real demand so in the current a over of our went through distribution a you noted bringing on board National where believe of their revenue moved to distribution similar to our catalog area such a HPA and to a large part the Power and a lot of the catalog Embedded Processing business much of go through distribution sorry over Of about of revenue is supported by consignment program mean of the distribution revenue is supported by consignment should note at this point none of the SVA through distribution is on confinement because we needed to get IP system in place to be able to support is in fact something we do and were working toward to put in place again for the broader audience when you have a distribution program on consignment our revenue recognition approach sellin tends to more sellout because it move the revenue recognition closer to where the distributor pull the product from the hub and actually ship it to their customer then if you more broadly about of total revenue and this includes distribution a well a our direct OEM customer are on consignment hope all the piece youd asked there go to with noticed your inventory day had crossed over in the and wondering if if you could comment on if it influencing how managing this the factory loading here in more remember inventory day are a backwardlooking metric and so coming off of a sharp revenue decline and then following with a sharp expected revenue increase to state your inventory before you get to and not after so you wind up with frankly an anomaly describing where the day of inventory compute higher than what youd normally expect to see when we at the mix of inventory we are extremely comfortable with it and it lined up quite well with generally the demand we see recall we talked about our book to bill went positive in the our order increased by gave u better visibility into actual end demand than had in several quarter now and gave u the ability to build and stage inventory in anticipation of when demand need to be delivered would the inventory is positioned quite nicely for what were trying to do for the would also loading in the yes inventory is one variable play into but more importantly be our outlook for at point the other would is even over the weekend reviewing some other transcript of call have taken place mean already hearing at this very early stage in the upturn where certain player are finding their own inventory too short or out of mix and having difficulty meeting up with or fully meeting customer demand are delighted with our inventory position at this stage in the upturn we it to be great Of course it play out a the market grows here over the next few quarter appreciate the color loading are increasing in the If do the math on your margin guidance for coming up with on a proforma around which would be up about point excluding the insurance payment and guess my is on an incremental would suggest around incremental margin which is lower than would have expected If loading are up are you seeing a negative impact from mix or some other item well give you guidance on the top line and the bottom line and in between well leave it to you to develop your model would again directionally correct we do expect it to be moving up over the certainly in the direction and the magnitude of not more than what been describing so far go next to with can also count me on someone who hoping were to have a growth here on semi heat a number of company last week about issue with wafer availability from foundry and there some lead time might stretch out over the summer you comment on how your availability is for foundry wafer then also your own lead time are they stretching out Do you anticipate could happen over the summer Ill start with the lead Right now again one of the thing we have a a takeaway on the last inventory correction cycle the fact we entered growth with le inventory than what necessary to meet would turn out to be quite a strong pullback or snapback in customer demand were coming into this certainly with more inventory availability than we had a of year when the last upturn occurred with in mind we have most of our lead time are quite normal at week or le and we have higher level of inventory than we did during the last industry cycle upturn Plus we have considerably more capacity than we had last Those combined lead u to feel we are to be wellpositioned to be able to meet customer demand even on strong growth far a wafer foundry availability is concerned again a declining portion of our revenue is actually sourced from foundry especially a you consider the baseband is winding down quite a bit because largely sourced from foundry nonbaseband portion of wireless also source lot of foundry clearly with the volume theyre at right now we are not experiencing any availability issue the other would is and had discussion with about this in the mean even if you at recent indiscernible board et cetera total industry utilization is actually at a high a lot of semiconductor company over the few year not need to and therefore they did not invest in new capacity whether it the foundry or whether it the IDMs own capacity our suspicion is if we get into much of an uplift at all in term of demand we very likely a an industry see shortage and lead time accordingly stretch out at the same and what before having a very good inventory position coming into this upturn plus having a lot of open capacity we is to serve u very well If you could maybe run down your take on the end market which you are better which you are in the worse shape and then how you see playing out for both and the rest of the can make some comment made the most substantial comment already in term of our view of what helping clearly automotive is an area of strength one of the few area where yearonyear a noted we had growth and partly had to do with some of the automotive industry overall Globally were impacted by supplychain issue early last from the Japan quake and tsunami so there a very good recovery even some pentup consumer demand on top of a trend for increasing electronics content and semiconductor growth Wireless infrastructure our view is the excess inventory had tended to build in channel essentially been eliminated seeing stronger demand now and we expect well continue to grow from here Again we ended up better than but well below both the a well a even the revenue level market heard u about before a consumer with their smartphones and tablet demand more mobile data are some positive trend are taking place there in term of carrier need to deploy more capacity even the type of capacity theyre deploying historically it been macro cell with in both mostly WCDMA but even to some degree some LTE Going you see more and more of shift to a small cell type of structure where our percent of content small cell almost by it very definition is to require SystemonaChip implementation and we have a great position both in term of the scalability from what done with the same equipment manufacturer from the macro cell and then trying to scale down into the small cell but also even expanding our position from there a strong trend secular trend overall in wireless infrastructure we play to our advantage literally in the year ahead Handsets le and le of a direct tie there for in term of the size of absolutely we smartphone market is healthy Growth in the for smartphones this compared with last some good healthy trend there Industrial from an enddemand standpoint not a lot of change again what were encouraged about is whereas in upturn in we had a lot of the vertical were lifting in the but literally it wasnt until if remember right before we started seeing industrial start to recover already seeing industrial market recover again a lot of it may not be end demand driven it may be the fact they are no longer reducing their semiconductor inventory creating the lift on again it healthy for u Consumer noted we had seasonal weakness there and in several different consumer area we had to get out of the and into what would be a seasonally stronger quarter ahead to whats on in space then the last one would comment on is on computing noted earlier HDD in recovery mode see continuing into such whatever bottleneck HDD played in term of the supply side of the market we essentially be lifted then at point well understand better what end demand look go next to see with Capital guess if at the midpoint to the south end of your revenue guide relative to end market and relative to many of your semi peer clearly tracking a bit better your thought here it more inventory replenishment or Texanspecific in term of market share gain andor your leverage to the right market color there would be great you could see a bit the all of the above with the exception of would believe we are seeing any real substantial inventory replenishment at all what we may be seeing is lack of inventory reduction in and of itself start to create a lift in demand for u again where ever since would of last through of this where we had been undershipping our customer now they have their inventory position where they need it they start ordering again consistent with their own production rate or their end demand and create a significant lift for u based on our view of how far below end demand we have been shipping of course to be broader than been busy through the course of the last few quarter and especially with the National product line very aggressively working design in position such when the market began to lift again we would disproportionately benefit then also heard u about on the capacity side we we be competitively advantaged a well a when these market go back into growth mode Capital Real quickly in term of some of the discussion around nanometer shortage if hearing anything on the demand side where on the power management or through all of wireless seeing guess some concern around getting other chipsets and what impact might have on the timing of your shipment from what Ive heard anecdotally through the investor world it seems there some of starting to rear it head have not heard through our business or the customer yet a a concern they have it could be there and we havent heard it we have not had it coming back to u through customer and our group yet go next to with of wanted to revisit this issue of margin and how we should about the different moving part of implied margin what are underutilization charge what is the mix impact Essentially what are the sort of the oneoff item and what are the more ongoing item then how we should about the walk back towards the mid margin model you had established before Ill mention what did a few minute to everybody else directionally we would expect our margin to be up would suggest maybe when you folk put the model together maybe theyre not quite estimating some line correctly when they into the future of the thing would point out is our OpEx be up another or point in the simple math rolling out other word our benefit increase occurred in of the so the well see a full quarter effect of and may be where people are having a trouble on their margin analysis To a far a our overall margin model would perhaps you our focus is on revenue growth and frankly it on revenue growth to grow faster than market and earnings to grow faster than revenue so we can continue to make healthy cash return to our shareholder a we have been in the form of dividend and buyback over the last few year not projecting actual margin greater than and and were also not concluding this from happening a margin are to be dependent upon product mix and utilization a you pointed out a you heard from of our revenue now is from our core product and clearly is now more than of our revenue and very encouraging from a product mix standpoint a we watch mix continue to shift were to the result not on margin and operating margin but importantly on bottom line cash and what we can do with for shareholder in the form of dividend and buyback your Core Wireless outside of baseband how do we get the confidence over the long this is a real growth driver for the when we in the market and all of these question have been asked before but when we in the market we do see at the highend Apple and Samsung taking a lot of the highend and then at the low end there substantially more competition coming online how do you get the comfort this is a you should be investing in over the long even if you take it into some of these embedded market would these add value or they be lower ASP lower margintype market guess this is one where would of have to we able to give you some progress report a we proceed where we have particular customer success in moving into some of these adjacent area we talked about can throw out because thinking about it a release happened want to about a with iRobot using OMAP for robotic imaging application an example but in some case customer are amenable to having their name discussed other case they want to theyd rather be a more discreet until they get their product in the market also announced customer in the automotive infotainment space using again OMAP would also this a case where our management team a strong track record of if a or an operation the outlook is not what we it need to be u not be shy about adjusting our strategy accordingly so this is one way hopefully we can get some credit based on a very long solid track record of making those appropriate strategic move and it be management driving change from of the a opposed to frankly convincing Wall Street and getting Wall Street to nod or shake it head on where were headed again give u a bit of patience here and well try to give you some status report a were moving along to help you continue to feel good about where were with it go next to with Did you when you talked about small cell is part of the way you have would include in your guidance or your view for wireless infrastructure both in the ended and in the coming are you able to me understand how your positioning in market is relative to other company such a Casio and Broadcom and they both freescale ph within market mean indiscernible described market a additive a opposed to cannibalizing macrobased patient sound you the opposite me understand how play between your current and your guide and your competitive positioning it additive versus cannibalization mean what to see is it of the next wave of technology might in term of base station and we see a significant part of this spend move to small cell we believe a the carrier are doing their best to keep up with the consumer data capacity need small cell is one of the most costeffective mean they can do because basically they can deploy these cell with minimal installation cost and even consideration their electricity usage are much more straightforward than continued deployment of macro base station were to see both but we over and this is looking more so than anything happened in the over were to see it represent a much more significant piece of the dollar content term of position a lot of people mean obviously it an attractive market everybody want to claim success guess all would is we have a very strong position in macro and we expect our position in small cell meet or exceed what we have in term of macro in term of where there were known program were put out for bid shouldnt way Of the total program various carrier et cetera not all of which are determined at this point already had design position in more than what would call half of the small cell opportunity those are a number of program the market share position actually is higher than because some of these player are more important than others again were off to a great start is a systemonachip technology it to you may see the very generation be somewhat what would call not integrated this is about cost power a lot of thing because of the form factor very very quickly drive fullup systemonachip implementation were to be very wellpositioned there Ill great design position our content these system is to be very high and we the market outlook there is good and it to be one where again of what we were saying in previous QA the result show when the result show great position but to the extent others claim they have a great position and create confusion there we may have to wait until translates to revenue and profit growth for me ask you in term of your view of the restocking rate and ask this because some of the key lead indicator we at the data coming out of China and Europe still are not theyre improving but still not at level we is driving significant confidence in your restocking program on right now you describe the environment a where destocking stopped but the order go up a lot Do you the environment at this point is enough for u to feel comfortable with basically where these key lead indicator out of Europe and China are still not essentially clear mean the is strong fantastic but to what extent do we need all these order market to show enough for u to feel comfortable the order were seeing is to be sustained asking about restocking rate were breaking up a bit on your there but to assume what it me take it from there mentioned what we believe were seeing is not so much the customer are restocking per se a theyve stopped reducing their inventory so even if they hold their inventory at lower level to result in higher order for u because theyve depleted the pipeline in their prior shipment an overall standpoint we do expect to grow in which mean were anticipating the economy is to do to support a reference to the global economy be some stronger pocket than others could reasonably expect the were stronger than Europe could also at Asia China in particular and it may they may have purportedly slower growth rate than recent but it still growing at an extremely fast rate compared to the Western economy rate against a very large economy itself already the largest economy in the world when we put it all together right now were not seeing or we cant necessarily prove a point to any evidence of customer restocking What it appears to u is more at this stage customer have stopped draining and are now at least holding their inventory and well have to make a few week or a few month perhaps to report to see if we actually see evidence of restocking go next to with want to ask a on the utilization side and forgive me if it a convoluted but the utilization rate you talked about at to roughly where did peak what getting at is you added a lot of supply your own acquisition of supply plus adding National What trying to figure out is how much of utilization dropped from wherever peak due to adding the supply versus the revenue coming down differently what revenue do you need to get back to to have the same amount of utilizationdriven goodness with your current manufacturing footprint versus where you were prior it may take the of u to try to give an answer for you on but the to referring to is in fact the utilization rate we discussed last we gave excuse me havent discussed what this is yet other than to we have increased our start in the factory and it take a while for those start to become out so our average utilization is about even the startsbased utilization actually increased in the is worth noting a you pointed out the incremental capacity we put in place over the last of year between the factory we acquired and the acquisition of National Semiconductor we have added worth of incremental revenue generating capacity so all thing being equal by definition a lower utilization than we would be at the same revenue level in the alone of course cause a larger utilization charge a is what you were alluding to we clearly have room to increase our revenue substantially with capacity brought on board the simplest way to about it is allin it about of incremental revenue generating capacity there Ill leave it to you to of model where you take u but frankly optimistic to not only be attractive from u grow revenue rapidly a the market back but also do so at very attractive margin given the cost of capacity when we acquired it Hopefully a clearer one on the SVA side of thing can you a bit about what driving the sequential growth there relative to your other segment given there sell in and so DIST ph heavy would have thought they would have acted a bit more synchronized with your other business the only other would caution against is a relatively easy compare against remember in we had some distribution channel change where we discontinued one of their major distributor added distributor would the compare is relatively easy against want to draw a lot of real strong conclusion about this market or market a opposed to saying at this point we would it an easy compare and put the challenge in front of team to let see if they can do it again after well challenge them again go next to with Youre forecasting CapEx at Still to get there youd have to double the run rate for this wondering if in the CapEx you reported in it what you expected to whether or not you some efficiency and there a chance to undershoot CapEx number the CapEx came in not far off from what were expecting for fact youll see u on the spending actually spend it closer to when we actually bring the equipment in with the front end of wafer fab capacity required over the last of year a larger portion of our CapEx is aimed at the assembly test site generally speaking the lead time on type of equipment is shorter and so we can order it and install it closer to when we actually have the revenue need for it a a result of we still are holding to our prior estimate of a CapEx for the would you if you take a at our actual CapEx spend over the last month it been a over of our total revenue and translated into a le than depreciation total revenue over the last month clearly the spend we did the last few year bringing on the wafer fabs we did been at very cost to u from a fixed standpoint and is allowing u to actually operate at much lower CapEx level than we had in the previously indicated we would be a to of revenue of CapEx model given the wafer fabs we bought over the last of year Over the next foreseeable future wed run up the lower end of closer to than factory could you spell out one last the Spansion impact to the margin Is something it hit right now in the can you quantify the impact at all wont go so far a to quantify but you we reported when we came out of the Spansion revenue ran about a frankly we werent would graciously we werent making a whole lot of profit on a a result once revenue went away the capacity left behind and converted and now for cost is all into the PL now occurred with the Whereas previously when it there supporting Spansion it in our Other for your question and with this well close up you for joining u hope to see many of you next week in New York of this call is on our our may now',\n",
       "       'well now take our from with my you took revenue guidance down about on Wireless weakness but baseband in the only supposed to be about anyway this suggests either baseband essentially went to or you saw a significant amount of unexpected weakness in Wireless outside of baseband namely OMAP and connectivity you give me some feeling for how the weakness within Wireless broke out what may be driving the weakness particularly in the area outside of baseband there is only one area is weaker than we had expected which is Wireless and includes both the weakness includes both OMAP application processor and connectivity product Outside of our Wireless our revenue is tracking consistent with our initial expectation which is for revenue to be about flat with what we saw in the back to Wireless a you recall from our release we had strong growth in OMAP in the and a we benefited from new product introduction across multiple customer a you whenever there is a new product introduction by a customer there also an associated onetime surge of revenue a those customer fill their channel with product although we had anticipated lower sequential revenue associated with nonrecurrence of the channel sale demand for OMAP is lower than what we had originally expected a our customer are now rationalizing both their expectation for ongoing demand a well a the associated inventory the result is we now expect our Wireless revenue to be about lower than what we had expected back in continue to expect our baseband revenue to decline about this adjustment is not taking place in baseband baseband estimate is the same a what we talked about in adjustment is across OMAP and connectivity Whats your followup Got it Followup on around booking last you had you saw booking strengthening in and strength had continued to move into you give u some feeling what the trajectory looked through and now into still give you confidence Do you guess the rest of your broader is still either at or close to a bottoming me directly on your order Order trend are good and in fact we expect both order and backlog to grow then to the point of how do we feel about is the still bottoming in a we talked about in we do believe is the bottom again we at it from a standpoint of the area responsible for this lower guidance is a single market being Wireless outside of Wireless again were seeing result are consistent with our expectation and result are typical at the bottom of the downturn example our revenue stabilize again outside of Wireless revenue flat to also growth in order returning Backlog and visibility are improving Lead time are short and we continue to believe inventory at customer and distributor remains low were planning for sequential growth to resume starting in the well take our next from with weakness in connectivity is it broadbased or is it to a small number of customer or device latter fact what would in connectivity is it the same a heard u about for the last of quarter there which is is somewhat selfcorrecting much more diversified now than it year we do have a of customer make up significant amount of our connectivity have their decline from an absolute design win standpoint were our position is secure guess would or stable maybe is the better word some of those program where we were designed into declining level over the last few quarter were seeing more of continue should also point out the decline in connectivity in is le than what were seeing in OMAP again the decline is more weighted toward OMAP than connectivity Do you have a followon now go to with a following up of the OMAP side Is it to a handful of customer Is it acrosstheboard guess is it their product arent selling through more color you can provide would be helpful it on the me not about how many customer because Ill those customer report their own when they report Ill of the stay focused more on what were seeing directly and in combination a opposed to breaking it out customer by customer being it a combination very typical for coming out of the holiday season you see inventory adjustment based upon the absolute result during the holiday season compared to those customer expectation it amplified a bit in term of adjustment when you have a lot of new product are being introduced by those customer because they have a real clear record or history of what sale they build inventory they hope for the best and then in the they make the adjustment based on actual result certainly part of it then part of it also is based upon small amount of history now theyre making some assessment of what demand for those product on an ongoing and how much inventory they need to support of demand all of of is blending together to result in the adjustment were seeing not to your it not a customer but me of leave it at if can Do you have a followon and quickly of a bigger picture historically have done a good a job a any and better than most at forecasting not only cycle but quartertoquarter back over the last quarter now you have lowered the bar in midquarter update and it turned out you actually beat it when you report your result it seems the difficulty in forecasting is a bit higher than it been before Is there something changed in either the environment or at made the forecasting a bit more difficult what do you attribute sort of volatility to it the market mean gone through a downturn over the last few quarter when you have the market through a rapid change it more difficult to forecast Theres not a change at this end in term of the process or anything gone through for forecasting hope what you described is the outcome again this were calling it to the best we can at this point Ill also point out if you at go back to and what or in the and what took place there everybody in the industry describing strength in the back half of anybody had well forecast the good news is of the way upturn happen right necessarily get a lot of notice theyre coming and they happen and then they can happen robustly and then theyll also happen somewhat in fit and start well see where we land but were giving you our best estimate of where it be well move to the next please we can now go to with have talked about the weakness in Wireless but if we back out the Wireless you talked about the rest of the being largely in line can you about of the put and take across the other end market end market are giving you outside strength relative to what you initially anticipated any color there would be appreciated me start with some area are Ill of hit a few are doing well and then Ill also maybe touch on the market a well given it size but in term of some area are noteworthy on the what Ill call strengthening side versus especially what we saw in the Automotive is one doing what would call exceptionally well not news to anybody because the strength in automotive sale been widely reported a those automotive sale increase and the electronics content in these car continue to go up we certainly benefit if you at where is positioned were very well positioned with both our and our Embedded Processing product and product make car safer such a rearview camera blind spot detection and also collision avoidance system were also well positioned in the navigational and entertainment system for car both those area aware are seeing rapid penetration and semiconductor content increase Probably another area deserves mention is Communications Infrastructure Again youll recall from our call in our Comms Infrastructure revenue declined a a result of reduced capital spending by North American operator although revenue is not back to where it in the of last we do expect solid sequential growth this in Comms Infrastructure clearly it seems it declined but it turned and it doing better then a final point would mention in term of area of strength is our sale of storage product go into hard disk drive customer grow this a those customer continue to recover from the flood in Thailand also would mention the market it of tie to what we were saying what about storage with storage up this obviously reflective of the overall market the other would though is encouragingly also recent demand increase for some power product we shipped into manufacturer of battery pack why matter is these battery pack had historically been a leading indicator for other product ship into on a somewhat delayed versus the product in the battery pack we find encouraging a well Did you have a followup well now go to with a clarification you give u your approximate percentage of revenue from the wireless market when you Wireless weakness is handset or tablet too we about Wireless we are talking the combination of especially in the context of OMAP smartphones a well a tablet the percentage of revenue if you me do it this way told you everything else is flat and therefore the difference between and is Wireless which should amount to about Youll have to check me on math but confident in number so we gave you guidance of what something at the midpoint so a over of our revenue in from Wireless Do you have a followon this change the belief in term of the slope or the timing of the recovery at all in semi this Not at all because again the adjustment were seeing is very to what Ill describe a a narrow of the market much broader business were deemed whether it industrial whether it the catalog product go across such a diverse array of application whether it other vertical segment Ive revenue is bottoming and profiling a we had expected and even more encouraging is what were seeing on the order front and growing backlog there no change to our view of the timing or the profile of the recovery at it a an adjustment taking place in a narrow vertical of the market being handset right well now go to with Capital a followup on your comment is to bounce back from the deep sequential decline or are you saying there a sustained pattern seeing there a sustained pattern underway which is before the decline which North American especially driven by North American consumer consuming incredible amount of data the various service operator are scrambling to try to keep up with consumer demand for those of you have gotten email from service provider talking about throttling data and such you understand exactly what about so a demand consumer demand not slowed at all a very sustained trend on Now outside of the we do expect to see China to see India start adding data capacity a well although also not yet begun what we then saw in some of those carrier been adding capacity slow down the capital spending and were seeing now start to resume again there absolutely a soft spot in when the carrier stopped spending picking back up and there no reason for u to believe overall trend of consumer consuming more data and service provider trying to keep up with them in term of adding and then soon to be LTE capacity continue a well absolutely we believe it the same Do you have a followon Capital do the Mobile World understood you had a compelling differentiated view and this is a longerterm on how is approaching Embedded with OMAP my how is the mix to a we exit this it mostly tablet and handset Is to matter ending this exiting this or is it more year out from now well see more non of what we call traditional OMAP application in the mix you see by the end of this we have a lot of evidence for you in term of various program are using OMAP outside of smartphones and outside of tablet you heard talked about we have more than asset customer engagement outside the smartphones outside of tablet underway Now how fast revenue ramp relative to smartphones and tablet to allow can take some to see over the next month a clear evidence of success of our penetration into some of these horizontal segment realized you were at the Mobile World Congress presentation but for some of the broader audience there a big effort underway to take the OMAP technology done so well in smartphones and tablet and leverage into other horizontal market completely and we leverage in multiple way leverage the technology investment is already in place and then secondly where in smartphones and tablet you tend to have a narrow customer base the horizontal market leverage the breadth and scale of sale force sale and field application people we can identify a lot of opportunity a we do in a we do in Embedded Processing a lot of those customer outside of smartphones outside of tablet need a lot of the capability are inherent of our OMAP technology what we especially about is you mentioned it a differentiated strategy If you compare what were doing there and what were ramping through our traditional application processor competitor most of those competitor their history is they are very narrowly focused on a few customer in a very narrow vertical market of handset and smartphones for them to go pursue of the very broadbased horizontal strategy were talking about is a huge infrastructure adjustment the point being we have a technology we can leverage we have the reach and customer footprint on a global in place already to go do it it absolutely make for u excited about opportunity we to see those result very clearly in the year ahead well now go to with so me ask a guess relative to the shortfall in the Wireless any way to help u of gauge what percent is coming from OMAP versus connectivity or what percent is coming from handset versus tablet Probably not and again other than what previously it more weighted toward OMAP and connectivity it cross both smartphones and tablet where again if you of at talked about in quarter of the of new product were being introduced across both of those space of the dynamic discussing are common to both of those submarkets Do you have a followon guess guess when you about the timing of the revenue shortfall miss is there anything you can do on the OpEx line a we of the reduction in profitability on the EPS line is it all coming out of margin this Youre not to see an OpEx adjustment because of a very shortterm type of revenue fall would make for u to go flash RD or sale force or anything in response to of market dynamic guess what would back in we gave you detailed guidance for a lot of the line on the income statement have a full line by line update for you me maybe make a comment help you out if you go back to our guidance we talked about from the revenue of profit number we gave you you would have calculated margin would be about of revenue at the middle of our we still expect margin to be about at the middle of our new lower although certainly on a lower revenue number Therefore the absolute profit dollar be somewhat le Operating expense you should assume they havent significantly changed nor have our assumption on restructuring or acquisitionrelated charge a before should also make the reminder of cost of revenue we have of acquisitionrelated charge in there again unchanged a well about margin at the new revenue OpEx about the same a what we had told you previously you can get hopefully all stuff aligned with what we gave you in term of guidance take our last from with guess the is any pattern you can tell u about in term of geographic demand again this is based on quartertodate what so far is and Europe are growing while Asia and Japan are declining again me emphasize a lot to do with global consumption and more where product are manufactured handset or tablet or whatever then can ask maybe a slightly longerterm talked about the potential for a recovery yet were already hearing the foundry are starting to get sale up recognize you make the of foundry not all your is at the foundry Is there any concern a you out about the potential for a capacity tightness or shortage a we progress throughout the course of the from the foundry one of the consideration is our overall dependence on the foundry even though it for the advanced logic product we are doing more and more with the foundry mix of advanced logic versus the technology required for embedded processor specifically microcontrollers and product is a much lower a a percent more and more of our production becomes inhouse because more and more of our revenue come from where were we do all inhouse being we so we have a bottleneck with foundry though is we do believe if we get a what Ill characterize a a typical rebound off of the bottom and the of growth you might expect over the next of quarter consistent with at least our own view of how far and how far down we are at this point versus call it in production rate or production rate by our customer we do believe we can get to a point where anything a revenue hit new high Semiconductor revenue hit new high and we can test the limit of the capacity out there and again a broader industry statement Of course you heard u in our utilization in the low so we given the capacity investment made over the last of year we obviously believe were to be well positioned in of environment if capacity constraint start to impact the broader industry did you have a followon yes a quick one talked about the handset well this is the a shortfall heard you customer are readjusting their demand expectation is it fair to you do not expect revenue to rebound back and we should model from this lower it back how it certainly in the very near not to bounce back level because at a minimum they had channel still in it it also inventory correction in it impacting it it should back but somewhere between where we are at and where we were in if you at upcoming quarter one me nobody asked this directly but to address something keep recently especially get asked about margin especially because in we had talked about if you take our margin and you adjust it for acquisitionrelated charge and the baseband inventory charge margin about youll recall in the call we discussed the closest recent utilization comparison is wouldve been when utilization about percentage point higher than what we had in the so in the margin to point below the margin we saw in summarizing last we were operating at a higher margin even though utilization lower bring this up because a lot of time people are trying to a of year we talked about margin operating margin a goal in a lot of different meeting people asked about are those still valid goal based upon of example we gave me of comment it clear were operating at a new on the margin front being our focus internally is to significantly outgrow our market not try to were not focused on the margin line mostly focused on the revenue line were confident if we grow revenue and and Embedded Processing were all to the margin would result again the knob were focused on turning up and turning up aggressively is revenue growth but revenue growth in some marginrich area those being and Embedded Processing again based on of number of question been getting in meeting outside of this call wanted to go through guess another would is most of you are receiving invitation for our investor meeting in New York City If you havent already responded please and a lot of you have but if you havent please do so to secure your place hope to see you there before we end the call me you the is on our you and good Ladies and gentleman this today call you for your',\n",
       "       'take our from with one is whats your of the slope of the recovery were likely to see here in asking of interested to do you your distributor and OEM partner are to rebuild inventory could you also clarify when you inventory were low a these thing ph on a dollar or day Ill offer some comment and can add some additional color Right now a mentioned or mentioned we have drained about of backlog over the last few quarter so our visibility in the is quite low looking at the classic sign of what in many cycle in the we do believe we are at or near the bottom of the cycle distributor inventory are at record low of about week so we would call very lean it certainly look our customer inventory are very lean also especially a evidenced by the unexpected uptick in demand we had in the half of the standpoint of how quickly it soak back up a bit hard to quantify with any of precision given the visibility due to our backlog would point out from a inventory standpoint our day of inventory are well staged If you compare to the last we saw a cycle somewhat similar back in half of point in we came out of into with a day of inventory down in the mid were looking to about day addition a mentioned were beginning to increase our manufacturing staff in anticipation of increased demand we be well positioned for when the demand back how steep slope is a bit tough to call you might add some color the only thought to add is right view is distribution inventory is on the low side and need some replenishment Theyre not at point yet where theyve begun to replenish but history would suggest in fact occur in general regarding the slope we if you at history our industry clearly doesnt have a history of a smooth lowslope transition in term of how it recovers well be accordingly Do you have a follow on do regarding fab closure one part of it is should assume how much of the saving is actually in cost of good then sort of a an adjunct to are there any other thing this you still see you can do to reduce cost all the saving we were talking about be in the cost of revenue line and well begin to realize in it full in full order by the we get to the end of the closure which be over the next month far a the other action there are no other action we would have to about right now take our next from with of excluding baseband can you give some color on what end market are doing better or worse than what you expected at the of your last update Where the rebound sustainable where do you it a temporary sort of inventory filling bounce right now a tough call see the demand but it very difficult for u to be able to of see through all the customer channel to understand is it reflect a movement on in demand or is it their inventory correction is beginning to slow a you heard u even back in our customer we believe were reducing inventory even if demand were to remain stable if the customer slowed their inventory reduction would translate to growth on our end again what we saw late very broadbased growth again beyond in term of is in demand or slowing of inventory correction we By end market to be honest with we have at the midquarter update a detailed cut would based upon the breadth we saw upside in our product line our view is it went across almost all end market a well a almost all region a well have a lot of precision again the feeling is it very broadbased across product line region a well a in market Do you have a follow on If at mean what would to understand is the trajectory of OpEx in more importantly guiding RD up in if compare it to an annualized number trying to align with the cost synergy you were expecting with the NSN integration before Is the spending higher than what you had expected before were those cost synergy more in SGA rather than RD the RD we of need to keep in mind we’ve a full of or one of National in our number right now to put another way in of course well have quarter of National in there Whereas in we only had one so may be of what seeing on front far a where OpEx is the best to do is use the guidance given and then go ahead and model from there using the of seasonal history you can clearly see when you take a at our reported financial result a we talked about we expect OpEx to be up to in the to if you start there and then model out get you to a good estimate over in mind ph your observation or your in the right direction on the National synergy all along the we achieved in synergy from National almost wholly be from GA and it our intent to use to maintain the entire RD part of the value we purchased a well a the sale force and achieve synergy on the GA side take our next from with guess my is given the of came in a bit better than expected from the midquarter update are you now sort of at a run rate where you would expect booking to grow in the and generate a booktobill of greater than me not extrapolate far out but what is the strength we saw during the latter part of carried thus far into the Now what we at this point is what happen through the Asian holiday thing slow back down and part of what were seeing is pull ahead of demand or how translate again the strength we saw late carried thus far in the on the booking side Do you have a follow on my is on utilization Now you mentioned about utilization include of the RFAB capacity idle into this guess secondly can you help me understand at what revenue you start to approach of target margin you have historically talked about in the of realize there a lot of mix go into a well but trying to get a of how we should about the model now with National included and the baseband unwinding on the utilization it include all the capacity we have been discussing over the last of year including the new factory we brought on and the equipment we brought along those factory and in fact we are in the low utilization the low To the of what revenue get u to the of model GPM of a defer until we can actually produce an actual to represent to you it higher than were at right now If you go back and take a in history you can see there were a time where we approached the of margin can go back into late and see those of number were showing up might be one point of reference for you to take a at to anticipate where wed need to be a we get back to those of margin can also give you a more insight into where we actually are with our fabs RFAB utilization is about currently includes all the equipment we purchased even though some of it may still be shrinkwrapped and in storage all the equipment we purchased for RFAB in consideration we have utilization again the equipped capacity were talking about from a revenue standpoint is about mean we have roughly of annual revenue in the form of start we have loaded at RFAB currently next come from with Capital Capital guess on how we should about seasonality for you with the no baseband and now adding semi should we about the typical seasonality into Boy it to be it’s easier to measure seasonality when it history than trying to project in advance but a consideration mean a baseband becomes smaller baseband is a product line more depressed in therefore would tend to maybe mute out some of the normal seasonal lift we would have into we havent done of a detailed analysis of national seasonality and what impact would have but the bigger piece would be what we talked about which is le baseband therefore le or depressed seasonality or decline in the and impact then on the transition a well Keep in mind a big part of our seasonality is a significant growth in calculator in which typically add about point of growth to the on top of what semiconductor do semiconductor historically including baseband historically would have been up about again historical allin seasonality for on a average would be at the with about of those point coming from calculator Do you have a follow on Capital very helpful a followup in term of margin you told u with a but then you didnt exclude the inventory charge from pro forma there anything else in there onetime related anything we should be thinking about onetime in the half of a well the large thing were what we talked about there the of a fair market value principally fair market value write up the of acquisitionrelated charge we put on the acquisition line of the restructuring cost on the restructuring line and the we have not excluded fact those are the sort of thing we consider a part of our operation and we need to manage it next come from with Capital wanted to understand the whats the right way to about National now you have had a of quarter beyond all the you spent before If do you x percent growth for what should be order of magnitude how much would SVA underperform or not at all in all the sleeping beauty talked about Are they starting to wake up help u understand the magnitude discussed in the for our anticipation in the acquisition of National it had been under growing the market for some now a we looked at it we expected it would continue to under grow the market for the by the approaching the market growth rate and then by the exceeding market growth similar to the expectation we had with our other business this point in of course at the design win cycle and the designin cycle and then how long it take for those designins to actually turn into production revenue we suggest you change your expectation from what described not to were not being a lot more aggressive internally to try and go off and do better than it too early for u right now to go off and change expectation would of underscore customer response thought there were some consideration customer would be pleased with our acquisition of National a been out visiting customer and talking to them their enthusiasm of this acquisition exceeded our expectation again our aspiration are high to turn it into a lot of revenue growth well you a it happens more so than trying to project it out too far in advance Do you have a follow on Capital do the a a followup to Viveks earlier on in the comp infra ph market this one you called out a being very weak particularly due to the North American CapEx Is the bounce back here something seeing from inventory replenishment do you in this market seeing some sign of sustainability Boy again we can market not recovered mean it down for the so we didnt see recovery in the you heard u even at the midquarter update part of what we had certain service provider in the North American market had slowed or put a temporary hold on some of their capital spending not to there may not be some inventory correction taking place a well but it also service provider putting a crimp on capital spending again we saw late in the demand is too early for u to with those service provider turning on again or it the OEM customer we serviced directly wanting coming out of their inventory correction our expectation clearly is a we get into of the midpart of the the North American market overall see recovery again how to translate what we saw in the few week late in into an overall statement take our next from with quick on the guidance it sound thing are bottoming here and clearly getting a lot better but the booktobill low at wondering why guide for better than seasonal with such a low booktobill Is it because the last week been so strong you of gone higher turn can you about a bit Ill add some comment and can add a well Again were of looking back to our classic signal we have in inventory cycle in the is a quarter of negative booktobills and declining of order which tend to then bottom out and then be followed by some fairly nice revenue growth on a sequential from standpoint in a quarter now of negative booktobill a of quarter declining order not to the necessarily the bottom or the is the bottom we believe were darn close to it whichever direction it in from standpoint and a evidenced by the demand we saw in and to lead u to the guidance offered also a you go back and at historical cycle at least with respect to number booktobill not a leading indicator came out of downturn into very robust growth mean go at a an example where we came in to with a weak booktobill and obviously had some robust growth again we lean too heavily on booktobill mean it a consideration but it not the only one the other would ask you to keep in mind we have of our revenue and our largest customer our highest volume program on consignment where booktobill almost by definition in a consignment program run at again there we rely more on those company those customer forecasted build rate a opposed to what you would see for example externally in the order trend or in the booktobill Do you have a follow on maybe a longerterm so in the you have talked about the target model it margin and off margin you much hit and maybe even exceeded it a bit in towards the end of Now the baseband is down to about of re and now folding in the a highermargin National can we assume your peak margin and peak operating margin and even maybe your OpEx should be higher now when we talked about model we talked a we average our way through the cycle what the investor should expect our to be able to deliver to them in fact a you pointed out we exceeded during certain point of the recent right now were operating or about to operate below given what we’re our outlook we’ve given for the all being certainly where a portfolio continues to get to average itself up with the fact the lower margin is becoming a smaller and smaller percent it too early for u to predict whether or not our peak on the next cycle exceed the peak in the last cycle certainly we have put together a manufacturing cost model and were building a product portfolio model should allow u to continue to be very reliable when it come to maintaining model would also you we continue to be very focused on growth and is on our nearterm objective a opposed to trying to predict when and by how much we would break out of the model we talked about if you at a lot of even peer company obviously Embedded Processing the part of the Wireless market were now focused up on are all what would call very target rich in term of profitability from the investor side were all to be much better served by driving a lot of growth in those area a opposed to of getting microfocused on margin Margins be good if we grow the way we have with the way we aspire to grow take our next from with can quickly ask you about Wireless especially about connectivity a well a OMAP you about how you view the sustainability of the upward ph growth in the OMAP which obviously is a reflection of solid design win you had recently any insight a to what your commitment and the engagement with your customer are there then also in connectivity the weakness there how much of due to any end customer weakness or how much socket loss Lets get back part of your because it lead into the other one Connectivity the decline we saw in let the overall for we believe reflects almost wholly the success or in some case lack thereof by our customer in marketplace the reality is our largest connectivity customer underperformed the smartphone market in we love our customer but our connectivity revenue is to reflect the success of our customer would be the consideration share in connectivity done well and would been reasonably consistent you take same over to OMAP OMAP there nothing say the customer cannot change processor even application processor even application processor where they might have a significant software investment developed our goal is to make they have no reason to change so to the extent we continue to develop industryleading product and mean from a performance standpoint from a power consumption standpoint a long a we continue to treat customer with the respect they deserve a a customer we is sustainable over the course of whether it application processor or embedded processor in general or our deep history in DSPs over had tended to be relatively sustainable and those customer relationship have tended to be strategic and long lasting again if a supplier give a customer a reason to change customer change been fortunate on front and we intend to continue to operate accordingly again connectivity in OMAP the reason were enthusiastic about it is it’s a great growth opportunity from the standpoint of the outlook for smartphones and we believe our position within the customer where were engaged is a sustainable one Do you have a follow on do Separate for how should we about your priority for use of cash the buyback rate down sharply from what it last a because the stock gone up and b all the cash usage used in term of National Semi between dividend and buyback how should we about your use of cash for this you summarized it good there have in fact stepped down the amount of dollar allocated towards the buyback we indicated we do a a consequence of the acquisition of National Semi so we can begin to allocate certain cash balance for repaying the debt when it come due use of cash remains unchanged from a priority standpoint though is and foremost were directing the cash at the activity we believe can result in growth the most obvious area where you see is in RD in capital a in CapEx and then followed by acquisition most of those acquisition once again aside from National are usually quite small acquisition To the extent we have cash then beyond our need after then we do allocate it of course to dividend saw u increase the dividend fairly significantly here almost in the versus the prior and we also allocate it to buyback be the order of cash use but and foremost is focused on opportunity we believe push the top line for growth take our next from with here OMAP did particularly well and it done well the last several quarter but how should we about the upcoming you track competitor product the from QUALCOMM been getting a lot of adherence and this is their big push into the integrated baseband modem which feeling a binge out ph at RIM and doubt at Nokia yet Do we extrapolate out not giving guidance here but why shouldnt we worry about what had been one of your strongest performer in the Wireless group given the landscape in the baseband side of the or the application processor side of the over the last or so Ed and again whether it the particular competitor you mentioned or the many other competitor would to encroach upon our success in application processor of all we take a a real threat but at the same we view the opportunity in term of player where we have share and opportunity even within the customer where were engaged but were not we have all of those program Theres a lot more were missing than we have so a competitor pick up a historical opportunity here and there Probably our view is were not sitting here satisfied with our current share are aggressively moving to take our success in OMAP and extend share we recognize fully well be facing a lot of good competitor in the process indiscernible without a this is of an adjunct to the same lot of LTEs product is coming through the design cycle now for this QUALCOMMs the leading LTE solution STEricsson is still struggling who you partnered with often in OMAP and Infineon you go down the list there arent many LTE solution and in fact Samsung and Motorola worked on their own paired with maybe one of your product Are you feeling is there a risk not having a baseband especially a baseband could imperil Is it something working with your partner on do you it also to equalize out in the next or so and be a robust merchant market for LTE and not one dominant supplier guess part of come with if there are limited supplier of LTE basebands they be able to successfully through heavyhanded approach leverage into application process or guess what would is the customer in the space tend to be powerful and those type of approach by where supplier try to bundle and leverage and all of stuff tend to be shortterm success with those customer we the momentum clearly is toward integrated application processor sorry to discrete application processor versus integrated and bundled chipset we put in the same category a good longterm success for a supplier in term of an approach to take well see but we view a a significant threat Do you have a follow on Ed guess your follow on take our next from with want to go back to sort of a derivation to the good asked earlier margin guess is and of all it look the implied margin guidance is down a hundred point for the want to make not too far off on the ballpark there then secondly is there some sort of ratio algorithm we could about for margin ramping x percent of revenue growth Again mix is to drive some of it but x percent growth is to drive x percent margin expansion about right on your margin modeling is down to be the very split the GPM dollar guidance we were talking about given the midpoint of our guidance so in fact it is down but would you it would be down only if charge were excluded out of the number correct Oh yes would also you the exceeds this normal paying benefit increase in our manufacturing operation a well a our other support group and plus moved from an attrition environment in manufacturing to an increase in staff and environment manufacturing those thing are to be adding manufacturing cost from into To your a to some algorithm frankly were sitting right now at the utilization and in the low incremental revenue is to follow through quite well when you utilization level well see our margin begin to step back up rather nicely with fairly modest revenue growth is a particular algorithm can offer to you but Ill simply you can much model it through on a delta a you have in the is take your delta revenue assumption quarteroverquarter and drop through many people drop through to odd percent a good way to get to what you the margin are to be we also gave you how much utilization impact there in the a well a where our utilization overall it give you a bit of idea a to how to potentially map a utilization go up Do you have a follow on guess a simple follow up baseband falling away is simply a function of your competitor finally getting product ramped up Is the driver there is there assumption on underlying customer share loss a bit of both but there are some competitor are in the process of shipping more product into customer there could be well have to see how customer translates their product position into sale would allow we have competitor are now in the process of ramping take our next from with wondering a a follow up on some of your earlier comment with respect to the cycle and following the rebound you saw in early followed by some supply shortage a you werent for the to back a aggressively a it did sound and guess part of my correct me if wrong in the assumption it sound it trying to put the manufacturing asset in place at least the variable asset to prevent from occurring again what mean of a we through this next cycle What point do you decide to ramp up the manufacturing a bit more perhaps put some more inventory in place to avoid what happened during cycle again of to back one of the easy metric to at and although it is backwards looking but it still somewhat instructive is day of inventory we were in the mid back a cycle began to the spring back this were sitting at about day clearly more inventory on hand Also if you go back and recall the history from back in point in we many others fairly significantly reduced our total workforce leading into downturn so consequently when demand did snap back it took some to bring work force back on and get them trained and get them productive this example gone through we have not taken same action fact what we did is we slowed our factory our idle factory for a few day where it made but maintained other than attrition maintained staff on hand so we have a trained workforce already in place a demand snap back we have the benefit of a largely alreadytrained workforce and having to add incrementally and well have the benefit of starting out with more inventory because there be more inventory than we had the last you put those together and we were a much better position this to meet strong snapbacks and still be able to deliver in reasonable lead time with our customer and deliver revenue and profit to our shareholder Do you have a followon guess a a follow on about the OMAP and you talked about the view of the with respect to your success in Perhaps you could about what feeling is still about the synergy of with the getting some socket a a result of having the OMAP also assume perhaps some of your competitor are more reluctant to put you on reference design because having do you balance internally all of the above are the case where by being in OMAP well pull through Power product because this we have the insight of all so therefore we can have the companion Power ICs ready to go when we introduce the new OMAP product many case the customer find it easier to use also have competitor use a part of their reference design and might they the fact were a competitor is a consideration when they have an capability internally but could be the case when it come down to it whether were in OMAP or not we so much at potential synergy would between and OMAP Rather we at the smartphone opportunity is a great growth opportunity it aligns well with the capability we have in connectivity in OMAP and then also in we go so much across well do we get the pull through of product because were in OMAP Some of may occur but we try to rationalize the OMAP plan based on synergy with is the best way to describe it take our next from with back to visibility and you cant sort of predict the booking is to do this but given the of and is it safe to booktobill is positive for those month Oh it me not get into breaking the down in term of booktobill because the tough part on booktobill is you have multiple variable in the numerator and the denominator can swing number around dramatically what in term of strength thus far in boy want to try to extrapolate out through the end of the were optimistic again me wait until we get further along Do you have a follow on fair Ill have an easier followup to the CapEx for the should we model to be sort of the linear now would go ahead and recommend not a bad way to at it by the way there no requirement you give the easy question fact would encourage otherwise with were about ready to wrap up all of you so you for joining u of the call is on our concludes the you for your',\n",
       "       'well go to with can ask you if there are any onetime item may have impacted the EPS the way it did related to the revenue downgrade are you asking specifically about why it seems EPS moved is correct Down disproportionate to the revenue would actually there are some onetime item me of walk through transition in general if can of all would mix is unfavorable if you about it we actually havent talked yet about product area per se but what would is were seeing downsize versus our expectation in some of the more profitable area such a communication infrastructure and some of the catalog and Embedded Processing product area while at the same were seeing upside in Wireless mix shift is unfavorable to profit margin and therefore EPS also impacting u this is utilization with revenue down more than we had initially expected also further reduced production loading to avoid building excess inventory so a a result the underutilization expense be higher this therefore further pressuring profit margin compared to last then finally maybe to the point you had initially asked have higher acquisitionrelated expense by about which is about per share higher than what we had previously expected Now in term of the what changed between the last earnings call and now we the macro continued to weaken in term of the expectation we have a bottoming process forming are you still willing to stand by comment even though had to lower now mean had to recalibrate how you view thing from here onwards respect to the earlier comment from your last earnings call how should about it let start with what changed again a in my opening remark the weakness is broadbased with the exception of Wireless revenue in our Embedded Processing and other segment is weaker than we had originally expected If you at it by end market communication infrastructure is exceptionally weak being driven by UMTSbased system in North a those of carrier await the outcome of their proposed merger Industrial market also remain weak and would in space we have both customer and distributor seemingly pushing component inventory level to very low level the computing space computing overall is down with decline at storage or hard disk drive customer especially exacerbated by the flooding in Thailand then consumer product area such a television and video game are also weak this mentioned the one bright spot is Wireless and there our OMAP revenue is doing very well this a a reminder were now seeing the benefit of customer program have ramped into production using our latest OMAP processor Those customer program include Samsungs Nexus smartphone which is our production program based on Googles Ice Cream Sandwich reference design Samsungs GALAXY S II smartphone Motorolas DROID BIONIC and RAZR smartphones LGs Thrill smartphone with it playback and capture feature then most recently the Amazon Fire tablet and the Barnes Noble NOOK Tablet are both based upon OMAP then the final end market area would mention is automotive there would describe sale into our automotive application we would expect this to be about flat which about a we had expected what changed go next to with wondering if you could add some color if you could on the order linearity did did you see cancellation and pushouts is it turn didnt in a expected how did order progress by for the so far would order total order likely declined some from the decline excuse me this decline includes the seasonal impact from calculator a well a what would characterize a lumpiness in baseband If we at our semiconductor product and pull out baseband because of lumpiness would order there have generally been moving sideways since the significant drop we saw in the of and we talked about in our call Theyve been of noisy from a monthtomonth but the overall trend been flattish since on inventory wondering if you could hazard a guess if you your OEM and your distribution customer are burning inventory now or what your visibility there is right reducing inventory and would in both front distribution we obviously see data most clearly because we what distributor are carrying they are continuing to take inventory down and would they have inventory down to very low level our belief is at the OEM customer inventory is being reduced and in fact were undershipping those customer production level go next to with of have actually a longer in the you have added a significant amount of capacity and understand these are not shotgun decision structurally are there action you can take to in the downside if macro remains somewhat weak for the next or quarter also mean specifically in term of shutting down some of capacity because margin have taken a big hit over the last several quarter and trying to understand how you can sort of limit downside from here given the visibility is still somewhat weak out there fact would not in our plan obviously there are a lot of option we could do but especially given our view were undershipping demand therefore when customer are through with their inventory correction we be seeing growth even if there is no growth in end demand or inventory replenishment a we move back to the customer production level in environment and especially considering the low carrying cost of the capacity we have on board we have no intention to take any of especially the new capacity been bringing on and doing anything other than fill it up over the course of one more mentioned you are undershipping demand if you looked at historical trend how long can situation persist ie is a bottom Is a bottom do we get a for based on what you have in similar situation before this tie somewhat back to the asked maybe hadnt gotten to specifically which is do we still believe were in this bottoming process in the downturn and the answer is we do what we at of all is inventory level of a customer and distributor are now very low and a before we believe were undershipping demand to reiterate at some point customer have to stop reducing inventory when happens our revenue grow a our shipment increase to match the customer production even if there no growth in end demand or replenishment of inventory for anybody watched this industry cycle over the course of you fully understand once you start to get in process and customer regain confidence in their own outlook the next phase is they typically then layer in addition inventory a well customer historically have not forecast these snapbacks in their demand and instead they rely on short product lead time to support their increased demand we are very well positioned both with our inventory a well a our short lead time to support inevitable increase in demand the other would point to which had mentioned earlier is the stability you might in term of the order took a step down in the of but theyve generally been flattish since which is to u indicative of a bottoming process a well have an exact Is it this or is it next a to where snapback could occur Historically if you at semiconductor inventory correction the response generally result in a of quarter of inventory burn looking at history well have to see what this one hold guess would we continue to be encouraged were in the bottoming process even though demand a weaker than what we had initially expected this go next to with guess is of strategically with all the strategic fab capacity you have how do you about using in this of environment maybe even more specifically a thing start to bounce back a bit do you try to be a bit more aggressive on pricing to pick up a bit of incremental bump in youll see a customer start to normalize the order pattern is it more important you keep pricing steady and try and get the margin back to a more healthy margin return to more normalized level a we fill capacity up my view is doesnt tie so much to pricing and a matter of a we ship more unit and therefore amortize what currently is an underutilization expense do good thing for margin heard u many time in the for the most part the proprietary product line we sell tend to be more specelastic versus priceelastic even were aggressive in pursuing new opportunity tend to do it based on the product specification were offering the support package the application engineering a opposed to thinking somehow if we drop a cent off the price somehow would make a difference in the demand we actually see again we tend not to view price Although also we recognize we have to be competitive on price we have a cost structure allows u to be competitive with any of our any competitor in the world again why for our salesperson price is not an excuse for them to lose a piece of but nor is it the reason they should win a piece of want to be competitive on price but we win the based on other consideration is specifically about understand there a lot of program ramp and design win and share gain and apps processor relative to the piece of the when is it fair for u to measure your share gain story again other word it always difficult in the downturn to well theyre not gaining any share in the downturn when is it to be fair for u to at your revenue share of the industry versus your revenue share in a previous or cycle and to determine whether the share gain story is of playing out it not fair to at it in a downturn mean we at it every Now we overreact to any particular data point the right way to do it is to sample it quarterly and we ask ourselves the if there a where we believe we underperform we ask ourselves why and frankly you should be asking u why a well sample it quarterly and the best way to make the story work over the long is to make it work every at the same maybe in a downturn this you may see more strategic longterm use in term of share from the standpoint of gaining position at customer on new design program and thing more so than the different show up in revenue particular again every absolutely count go to with you on your call believe you the distributor inventory is worth week and at normal level sound theyre lower now you have a clear visibility there can you quantify where they are now at least qualitatively about how close they are relative to where they were at the depth of the financial crisis want to try to quantify where distributor are right now until the end of the but your interpretation of what were saying is correct distributor inventory is down this fact and maybe if can comment on distribution overall but make some inventory comment If you at resale we would expect resale from distribution to the client compared to the although at this point it look theyll decline a le than revenue would overall if we take the national or the SBA revenue out because we only had it for what a week last Inventory distributor we expect to be down by a doubledigit percentage at this point again compared with the Although Ill also includes inventory return from a discontinued national distributor so the return from distributor contribute maybe a few point of the decline in and of itself Even without you can see there a sharp decline in distributor inventory level one data point saw Ill pas on almost anecdotally if you at inventory for the product we would characterize a to the industrial market in the last of quarter inventory of those product at distributor been cut in half again the distributor are moving aggressively in term of reducing inventory we all have to watch it because demand can back quickly again call it the buffer What we feel comfortable with is our own inventory we were well positioned distributor are tightening up somewhat but we feel we have enough buffer to be able to respond a come back again for detail of modeling the cash flow for next guess have to believe frontend CapEx be at maintenance level and been you may or may not have to get back into equipment is a fair way to about it two could you give u a of what is a maintenance of CapEx one way to at it overall is historically guided we would expect our CapEx to somewhere between to of revenue you pointed out with the capacity addition made and over the of year it fair clearly have pulled in capital spending from future year need to spend a lot on frontend capacity therefore we would expect to be at the lower end of of what you both capital maintenance on the front end and then addition to assembly test What would is even assembly test depending upon growth a we have more year produced obviously well need to expand our capacity on assembly test after we refill the existing capacity so with utilization both on front end and back end coming back somewhat a gone through this downturn clearly we have room to grow from current level before we even need to spend on back end capacity to any significance go to with qualitatively talked about some of your end market but could you also do the same for your region space guess and again this is based on the month of the and extrapolating through the end of the no surprise Europe is currently our weakest region followed by Asia and then the of those region we would expect to be down based upon month worth of data Japan therefore is the only region is tracking to be up and a it continues it postearthquake recovery talked about the Wireless infrastructure being intentionally weak and you mentioned maybe due to some pushouts Do you have a on how those pushouts meaning is it a or is this to be a multiquarter pushout a it go beyond our customer to their customer what the carrier and all aware theyre trying to merge and how they spend and where they spend be different based on whether merger happens or if for some reason it doesnt happen so in the interim while theyre sorting out theyve much stopped spending have no idea how to ass how long may last but whats currently impacting u there in term of the decline Other carrier are flattish Some of the program in India or China all talked about and hoped maybe to be ramping are still on hold at this point but actually whats impacting u in term of the decline would be those North American carrier talked about go to with one you you also on the call about a is booking have essentially bottomed for the last of month but clearly the revenue outlook is worse wondering what is the difference there is this in your opinion a massive inventory drawdown by the distis Are your customer telling you where demand is risky ph you sort of parse out can and can too specifically about customer demand our assessment is this is mostly them taking inventory level down more than what we had expected a opposed to their demand is significantly weaker than what we had expected have you noticed any guess worse performance from the national versus the legacy Is there any more downside from national Do you any of this is a result of the merger fact would national is declining this but declining about the same a our HPA revenue a you both of those area are catalog product sold through distribution would they both have relatively strong tie to the industrial market which is weak right now wouldnt national is disproportionately a factor one way or the other here go next to with guess trying to figure out a bit better whats on with margin in the guess can you help me understand if OpEx dollar are of flattish with the old model it implies sort of a point drop If the case whats utilization versus mix were you able to do anything on the OpEx line with the national integration is OpEx of a fixed cost this me make understand or maybe me of reiterate what we last OpEx we in our call our view is OpEx would go up somewhere in the to a combination of basically having a full of national OpEx in versus only a week of it in the then also we talked about some of the a we had adjusted in light of the environment and forecast some of the variable element of compensation in the there were catchup accrual basically to adjust the cumulative effect for half catchup piece of those lower accrual would not therefore recur in the we OpEx would be up about to Suffice it to in this environment were to try to keep a tight control and do better than certainly part of it which is were not to be able to do anything about OpEx go up by about amount margin a you pointed out be down but it also down for the reason talked about mix and then specialty utilization then the only other consideration should you about is remember on cost of revenue there about of additional expense in the would describe a acquisitionrelated tied to the fair value markup of the inventory we received from National a part of acquisition those are the moving piece can off to point out at this point Did answer your guess a a followup midpoint of revenue coming down by about guess want to understand did Wireless quartertodate on the OMAP coming in better than you originally expected at the beginning of the can you help u of give the magnitude if x out OMAP whats the rest of the doing versus expectation at the beginning of the yes OMAP is doing better than expected cant quantify it at this point in the but would OMAP is growing very nicely and well have more detail for you in we expected good growth out of it and it delivering even better growth so other area are making up more than offsetting growth and obviously taken the overall guidance down theyre all doing quite a bit worse than what we had anticipated when we came in again for reason of both macro a well a inventory reduction go next to of an inquiry on the related business mentioned some Thai flooding impact Is proving to be a bit worse than the what the expected into the or much in line and again if you go back to what we in we looked our own supply chain risk both in term of a lead frame we bought from a supplier there we knew would be disrupted and from assembly test we had there and we quantified impact a about again supply chain What we tried to communicate the order effect which the customer the direct customer impact of hard disk drive were manufactured in Thailand then maybe even a order effect of manufacturer couldnt get hard disk drive might be weaker than otherwise expected again we had some estimate there but clearly is having impact certainly the order effect how much were not the best source to be able to comment on the manufacturer theyre to be impacted by the same macro consideration every other market is they likely would have been weak anyway Was weakness exacerbated by lack of storage one of the designins you have with OMAP the Kindle Fire done a good job getting other content in there WiFi you at your designin funnel with Ice Cream Sandwich system do you see a greater propensity of those design win bundling more content how do you about your ability to attach other component when you get OMAP design win would describe a strong no guarantee but usually almost always when we win OMAP well have some power management type product attached to it then sometimes connectivity bundle the there be place we fill connectivity without OMAP there be place we fill OMAP without connectivity and then there be customer we fill both into almost always when we fill OMAP customer find it more convenient to work with on a lot of the product such a power management a well a our sale force is trained to work their way through those customer system and pick up a much of companion content a they possibly can would when we sell OMAP we usually do very well selling other product outside of OMAP a well you for your question and before we end the call me you the is on our you and good today you for your',\n",
       "       'why we start up by through the comment submitted in the last earnings call about starting to see the beginning of the upcoming process and incidentally our analysis actually show the semiconductor company have been on the shipping and demand since but at the same there a destocking process among the key industrial customer any comment you can make a to the parameter around which you made statement it is a very simple set of statement go back to the discussion and had during the call What we pointed to and Ive been in the now year and our team been in there a long were seeing a the ended a slowing down of the decline or the slope of the order coming in starting to dampen combine with the fact lead time are very short then put on top of inventory are actually quite lean and usually a good sign thing are getting to the bottom or near the bottom we guided to be down from you have to take those word into context of the shaping of the bottom a opposed to a single declarative point of here it is the Semi industry been very predictable when thing are strong people are anxious to have a much inventory a possible because theyre afraid of not making shipment when thing go on the other side and lead time in they go back to old habit again and usually is a good indicator of whats to start again what were seeing me move quickly to National Semi because this been a very fundamental deal been done this in the world the biggest in Semis in this current cycle question there when you cast your mind to when you did the BurrBrown deal a while and then this one what are the lesson between those and there been a long span between the deal but they are quality and very fundamental in the history of what are the lesson the is obviously what are your parameter to get into synergy were outlined in term of growth and cost and capacity rationalization well me go through them if forget something prompt me on the is important is the context of the acquisition different what mean by in the case of National you had what is proved what we theorized and now gotten and looked closer is a highquality portfolio with some highquality people but it did not have the commercial direction and the commercial leadership allowing it a we had talked the consistency of commercial leadership to allow it to be successful it significantly underperforming so it a very simple theory of we could take our sale force our reputation of consistency of direction and combine it with some great talent and some great product a we talked to a group and Lowe and the had in the Valley day they a bit of a sampling in the we closed odd day taken set of unit manager around the world for this infamous world tour in day our definition of integration Lets go visit customer they visited a they went around the world over approaching customer introduction done with sale people it several thousand distributor sale people talked to Lowe what he done and he commented he been slept in his own bed night in the he doesnt of a meeting they held where they didnt have a design in interest meaning a chip on a board at the end of meeting a good indication theory been true and we ought to be able to do well on Now contrast if you back to BurrBrown in it wasnt an underperforming asset it well run at had good skill what we had to do there were some different thing and in a different state in term of our maturity a an so in case if you go back and at even some of the early analyst meeting we talked about defining some new process technology together because they had some very keen insight what high performance meant the thing had to be done for data converter so the thing we were after from a synergy point of view and strategically were very different then what were taking advantage on the national deal last one and boy it almost answered in the introduction gave on National remember Lowe in the heart of the BurrBrown and the Unitrode activity he sitting there watching all the thing we did Szczsponik run all of our worldwide sale the sale team at one of the great benefit we had and we felt this would help u we had a lot of lesson of shouldve couldve a a great way to back in life and now let apply those very simple thing we were fully integrationwise day website were linked everybody knew what their job would be for the longterm went out and spent day out selling with National not spending the discussing roadmaps internally Organizationally Lowe is literally out running the Silicon Valley or the National because we learned the best way to meet the people the people and the product is go live with them Dont try to sit back in Dallas and judge whats happening but go out in the middle of seeing a number of thing benefit u because we have the continuity of people were involved in some big acquisition and integration year and right at the front of this one in term of the growth synergy obviously one of the comment made at the when the deal announced how this would help you grow faster than the industry with all been done and granted it a bit early to start measuring some of these parameter are you still confident at still being able to grow at a rate much faster than the industry would tell you the it one to study meaning go through the product and study from the outside confidence in the product judging the people theyre highquality and it a to now be and see it in real life and visit customer with the and see the knowledge the of respect the hunger by our customer mean if Ive had Ive had visit myself where people are literally saying we love the National product we couldnt deal with their commercial behavior now to design it in and were changing what were doing couldnt ask for a more encouraging setup on the guideline we had where we believe we can get this deal to pay back within year and we had of laid out some growth plan of when we would have the National team performing at the we expect of the team we have no reason to believe we cant be on and assure all investor they can guess the internal expectation we have on ourselves and we have on the team out there are even higher than what we modeled or what talked about now to go to take the great energy and the great early start and were simple to convert it into result one last on this subject before move on one of their concern obviously about the product overlap both fairly successful in the highperformance space and to what extent are you seeing overlap need to be eliminated mean right now the top line is interesting to see because we believe you can in many way deliver some of the benefit is well get them done on the cost side is of where all feel not very clear a to how much cost can be taken out of product overlap area be very clear because it a topic they covered even Wednesday or Tuesday this week when everyone out there If you at the overlap we had of ballparked it a to and by studying product and studying overlay and everything we see it is a good estimate maybe even at the side of a opposed to the biggest point have made and Ive made it to the National team Ive made it to the folk internally and all investor is were simple about product overlap and is if find out we have group calling on a customer my only is who won people are what do you mean is the culture we want because what youll find is the group whose product win end up being the leader in area the group product whose product didnt win take those resource and direct them to a better opportunity internally adjustment actually happens quickly in our and in the cycle on front what had theorized and we had guessed then it to turn out to be very accurate were not to have to do a bunch of refereeing of this is overhead this is duplicate or this is not Hes made a of minor adjustment were obvious to start out and he often running the cost synergy we talked very clearly we should be able to get of cost synergy out of the National deal would be primarily and significantly on the SGA side where you have duplication and corporate structure and corporate function we would be realized on a run rate a after close cannot compliment our team enough They had all those decision and all communication and all done on Thursday before the close on Friday back or whatever it the speed and decisiveness it also the right human meaning people what theyre future is and help team work together well look very good we have no plan to have a bunch of RD synergy in fact if we have area a commented before where one group is working on a chip close to another one want them shifting a bit to the left or right and go pick a more unique area These are talented people let turn them lose to design great part for u fantastic switch to OMAP the vision you articulated of and Embedded Processing OMAP been one area obviously fit within the Embedded Processing story Of late there been a lot of success with the new OMAP product been designing to a lot of the new Ice Cream Sandwich Android product Samsung Kindle you about thing here is when at the competitive dynamic within OMAP of the top player you are the one without an architectural license QUALCOMM NVIDIA to what extent is an advantage or a disadvantage for you not to have an architectural license usually the one of the licensee on the next new ARM core but want to see how sits within the competitive dynamic the then two what do you attribute to the recent success had have coming back and searching into some of these new Ice Cream Sandwich product and how sustainable can be therell always be debate on subject this is it good or bad to have an architectural license realized you can have other people and theyll tell you why it critical Ill tell you it dangerous to have it Ive had customer tell me the same when you take something from ARM and then change it it to take more to get to market the only guarantee at the end of people changing it is it different Now the designer changed it is to tell you it better but it later and it different so in a world where you want to have consistency on the ARMbased code have to be very careful the way when you want to have consistency on the ARMbased code it a great strategy fact if you at thing we do we typically be to market with the newest generation of core from ARM because we change it we get it done sooner so to find tends to prevail youll see u do it again with OMAP with the latest Eagle Core come out of ARM accordingly well be to market still matter in this it go a long way side of and in of of why have we had success and how sustainable is it or some people want to how sticky is the Android success you have fact is the most important and Remi and his team have done and them do it consistently throughout the generation of OMAP is theyve a great team know how to out ahead and deliver performance and power and balance is a mobile world is not about core and it not about megahertz about the user experience per unit of milliwatt of power per cost team done a great job of looking out ahead knowing what multimedia trend what browser requirement what audio decode all the thing are to be required on phone platform and then designing a very special platform What to accelerate not on the ARM core so it get done faster on lower power what theyve achieved is because of capability they have been able to get selected a the lead platform by the Android several time also watched u get accepted by Microsoft a the lead platform on Windows while a lot of people may dismiss it there still well have to see we have the lead in primary platform with the QNX folk of RIM it important to have the world best operating system on your platform let you go more place it great to be there it great to have a team can ahead theyve a great software compatible roadmap through device of the OMAP family and the coming OMAP family what Ill tell you relative stickiness is it help to be there but it not a guarantee what itll down to is to execute well to be working closely with the Google team and with our OEMs and make were continuing to bring them the most competitive platform if we do well well enjoy the benefit of to to the Windows platform a bit later but can point to something been raised a an issue is you are working there around the baseband having decided to shut down a of year and NVIDIA which is one of the platform selected by Microsoft bought Icera and QUALCOMM obviously started up live a a baseband are the only one of the doesnt have a baseband strategy if had to put it way we now migrate to more lowcost smartphones where integration seems to be a key parameter is a market you you could still play not having an integrated product obviously how do you see the dynamic playing at even within the higher end smartphone market where there been an argument from QUALCOMM to need more integration into those market comment you can make there a you the debate about integrated and not integrated have been on for or year we had a lot of people year there no market for discrete app processor and at whats taking place so we continue to see a a very healthy marketplace for discrete and the smartphones obviously you get into tablet it with a very different architectural decision so youll find discrete is the dominant platform for a very long on the tablet front smartphones youll see a lot of headroom and a lot of runway in term of the discrete go to havent been around a long baseband is simply a destroyer of capital Integrating a destroyer of capital into your model doesnt make it better it isnt easy taking a baseband and you how big it and how successful we were at it and saying were to go without it it also a heck of a lot better than trying to embrace a where there at last count different competitor in the baseband a Ive learned too often in this be a reason to go do something Go work on the product are truly to differentiate the device to be the application processor and to be the connectivity and so we feel good about where we are very interesting you raised point me switch to Microsoft and to back to the subject of baseband again later on in the conversation the Microsoft base Windows program ARM now been selected and you NVIDIA and QUALCOMM are the top selected to play in market market is supposed to span both handset tablet and PCs do you prioritize the of them Have you chosen where not to play been suggestion you not be playing in the market or even in the server market which is of where some of the ARM they can extrapolate the ARM core into any commentary a to where you want to play within the whole continuum of Windows Ill go even beyond it been suggested Ill reinforce it a very clear decision take your product where theyre designed to be great and so where and Remi and team are doing is Windows into the mobile side of tablet or different format or form factor around could be smartphone variant where we focus our energy when it come to Windows there are company go attack back up into the traditional notebook or traditional desktop or even a you some taking a at the server space those are certainly logical opportunity ARM a great advantage into some of those market but we clearly prioritize our RD in direction well do it because when we at this overall application processor space yes smartphones are important yes tablet are huge but we also a u do for year in the wireless space we want to through to the longerterm trend the longerterm trend are very obvious is the next people spend talking about is the impact of cloudbased service when you about a world year from now with extensive cloudbased service it to lead to a wide variety of device and some of those are smartphones and some of those are tablet or specialty tablet but there automobile in the world Theres home automation in the world Theres settop box and medium player People are to want to watch and view their information and stream information not to one part but to actually it could be a dozen different device we want to make with world emerging is we have the most important operating system could be player out in frame certainly Android is to likely be one we Microsoft with Windows they take kernel and move it further out into the embedded space when you hear even week about building a horizontal or broader market for OMAP and for connectivity it with vision and view in mind this is not about aiming backward to the last decade product but looking out to where we the world on front me be it is clear is not a priority within it is correct the subject of baseband closure and you talked about destroying capital within and of watched walk away from are huge the DRAM you walked away at the right for the DRAM before the whole imploded here you could debate year earlier wouldve been even better but at least the timing still great because subsequent to the industry literally shrunk for basebands the timing also and it to walk away from what at a had proven to be a profitable for you a very interesting decision but the problem though still still continues to grow for you in the area is it being difficult for the partner having named by Nokia to take a bow from you because last it actually still grew want to understand a you decide to close why did it take you so long for you to walk away and should we still be at a when you should walk away from to me it very simple forget when we had talked about the Ill bet we specific somewhere in and the multisource announcement were sometime in we essentially assume by it still a good assumption people ask whats the shape of the curve and we draw a straight line and all we promise you is it wrong be a function of Nokias success in the market the mix of what theyre shipping and the rate at which they get other people in place so and encourage people over interpret baseband down in and backup in far more to do with what Nokia manufacturing and building at a opposed to any big strategic implication we are well on our way to you could assume number is to be very close to by Is there still any IP left in you can monetize and because when at DRAM you still generate a reasonable royalty stream in the DRAM market If you at handset is of similar on the baseband side if you and be careful because we necessarily IP with where it created we are a very significant holder of a lot of fundamental wireless pad including in the or LTE world at the the pad portfolio which year it crown jewel were DRAM patent watched diversify and the reason we have such a strong portfolio is our very creative engineer over who filed patent a we have innovated in a lot of these space IP be well protected and used to make we have the freedom to operate but it also generate a very nice ongoing stream of royalty for u me switch to Embedded Processing and to take it by subsegments in the com infrastructure been an area where been very very strong but last declined double digit and for many reason obviously whats on in Europe and even within the there were certain delay What is your a to how play out and not trying to get you to give u a guidance for next but if you through the conversation you have with your customer how do you see playing out shortterm mediumterm longerterm and out if you would Other want to ask is to the interplay between you and the PLD company If you and Ill give of a mid and a longerterm so and year maybe made the comment before when we were talking about the handset and our view on application processor and out for world of cloud computing and what the implication are in term of device and an exciting area for u tell you equally excited with a cloud computing vision of the world is the plumbing to go into making it work plumbing range from server to wireline backhaul and yes a very extensive communication interface or a com infrastructure world take place from a wireless perspective a big participant in the infrastructure of the base station a it get called and so when we out to world we see it a if still a very exciting and expanding market the nearterm you see and it done this for year a tender out and go away it tend to have wave of up and down but you of at the line the secular growth go through and still very strong next to see and were very wellpositioned to benefit from it is to find a the world of LTE evolves is to find a whole small cell or femto a lot of different name you could put around it basically where the cell size get smaller so you can get the traffic density and it could be either for an enterprise or even private but more citywide metro deployment on so when you start thinking about what the base station count would do in a small cell environment we get very excited about a great content from a multicore DSP system point of view also great content so data converter offvamp ph RF Front Ends these are very sophisticated piece of equipment and theyre full of a lot of the thing we tend to do very well we are excited in term of both the intermediate and the longerterm most of them never go steady up after Itll roll up and down depending on the tender by the service provider at we love the direction do you see femto a complementary or a of alive in micro cell it to be very complementary you at how it happen and if you spend with the leader in the industry you see how you have to have a macro down through femto strategy to handle different demographic different density different deployment on into enterprise so it is to be something where what our customer love about our approach is we can provide a scalable and softwarecompatible solution the extensive investment they have to make is in software they want to be able to take investment and be able to scale it from the largest system down to the smallest system so a they can handle the processing demand of and still scale them to give them option we tend to be a perfect partner for Fantastic Hard disk drive been a very good player in the hard drive for some but me start sort of asking you your thought on the whole Thailand flood issue a better resilient supplychain with Japan bounce back fairly quickly but Thailand seems to be a slightly different situation commentary a to what seeing in Thailand what is exposure both direct or indirect and in term of the conversation of late a to how the supply chain is trying to deal with this maybe helpful obviously can be more definitive about impact on and than you have to speculate a you get out into the broader supplychain have direct operation in Thailand do have some subcontractor They represent le than of revenue very small percent of the unit matter because if one of our customer or on one of those unit a important unit we in good shape saw one of the on Wednesday before took off because been working this closely we have alternative and plan put in place where we we can get most of our customer through all of those issue because we have the flexibility because percent of our unit is low can get it moved somewhere else or work with subcontractor to have it done in a different place from a point of view it look it navigable relative to where we are Some people a you pointed out starting it we are a big supplier to the disk drive industry on both the preamp which is not a closely impacted but on the well the preamp is closely impacted servo not a much we see the speculation of what the unit shortage be in also a agile channel watching them adjust inventory and volume what the exact impact be on the drive industry and therefore upstream into the industry my guess is people usually find way to get through it best guess is what matter is when Thailand start operating again best input were starting to have is the water been coming down they are getting the dyke fixed and more pumping taking place in some of the park If you of work the north of the city further north it get wetter a you go further north Those are starting to get dried out and our guess is youll see operation back in and we should be on front well have to watch we saw in Japan and we were clearly impacted very directly in Japan where the wafer fabs world make a lot about people saying to take market share from somebody or somebody to gain it or lose it and there more noise made around the event and le position changed during it and a agile set of supply chain and customer and theyre all busy trying to navigate let get out into and well get a better Automotive been one of the area obviously directly impacted by Japan and a bit of a good resurgence following the whole Japan issue being resolved now Hardly some of the growth is a catch up from the disruption in do you we regress to the main in term of trending back to a more intrend growth if we allude to automotive how are you seeing the demand trend mediumterm on the line beyond the inventory stock and post Japan a great automotive but it not across every end OEM and every chassis and every device guess knowing constant of supply chain you ought to be getting close to when you get month the event were intuitively near Ill tell you me excited about automotive and it get lost in because the story tends to be more the earthquake or recovery is when out over a and and at the impact of infotainment coming into cabin of car this is a big trend because consumer are being exposed to product we work on smartphones or tablet people are simple want to be able to take experience into the car should be able to watch my movie listen to my music and should all connect up and work and ought to get done end up being a great of mediumterm growth opportunity at some area were working it fall under this whole driverassistance world of lane changing of collision of parking assist these type of thing use DSP and processing capability is to be a large growth opportunity over a and other piece is missing here in the is China is to be the automotive unit grower sitting at unit annually total global volume of China talk about potentially number doubling in not too many year and these are not decontented car these are full up braking system suspension system infotainment driver assist These are to be great opportunity for company have the right product and we tend to be wellpositioned because we have the of mobile consumer perspective OMAP brings u and then you combine with our and microcontroller expertise and our DSP expertise and then put it together with the fact were a longterm supplier of the automotive industry and we those add up to a good opportunity a lot of hope on fantastic one more on Embedded Processing before we get into the balance sheet and the use of cash a the next line of questioning bit and bit micro product for you since some competitor start to into market of late Microchip become a player in the bit market Finally there been some survey put them at the top of the design engineerdesigner preference Question for you here you have not been in the bit market entered the and bit market Are there any opportunity for you in term of growth between the tablet how do you differentiate between where your bit go and where bit go because the tend to overlap each other once in a while then how do you view the competitive element in this market a we start to see the resurgence of Microchip in market hasnt been a player a of thing the highest comment is if we had and Ive had some meeting this week and even today discussion it usually OMAP OMAP OMAP and then if remains Embedded and encouragement or reminder provide to investor is theyre to find Embedded continues to grow make a lot of money and generate a lot of cash my guess is one of these day it might actually make it to the slot the is on front when we at the interest we see from customer and our sale force on where were with the Embedded Processing strategy it feel very good obviously been a longterm leader in DSP so some people not a surprise well it also good the team are doing the right thing to grow part where am so encouraged is Brian Crutcher and his team have put together a winning strategy in microcontrollers some people it a and bit discussion if you at our family it address the bit and bit market so when people ask how is it differentiated it is ultralow power it is very cost effective and you get down to where you can literally get into toothbrush razor automotive application the spectrum of place you can take or bit product are very wide a multibilliondollar tale we have the opportunity to build a billiondollar a on front the are well on their way to doing it if you at what set u apart from anybody else because there been people in the bit market for year is we have the world most modern and lowest power processor with the best peripheral and the best memory what end up winning in the microcontroller market the bit world we had made an acquisition now forgot odd year to accelerate our entry into the bit and the team continues to gain momentum and again it come down to very simple in microcontroller world and is great core great peripheral great memory option and put good customer support around it and Brian and his team are well along the way on front another member of family doesnt get talked about much it a very highspeed embedded controller it the family and it been one of the wonderfully quiet star portfolio a it go into application motor control world a lot of motor many of the industrial motor have historically had no electronics in them for year they run at a single speed this whole advent of variable speed control the motor turning only at the rate needed for the work being done our family work very very well been fortunate to be growing with some of the top air conditioning company top solar inverter company people have been focused in area we are pleased with of bit bit bit and the highend bit so strategy let u take an offering actually none of the microcontroller player have Microchip doesnt cover front a good a they are the other incumbent to scale around nobody touch the breadth we have on to stay focused and execute glad you observed it is above growth we decided to spend some to you people there more to and so on the highvolume highperformance quickly me switch to use of cash so post acquisition what are your priority now for use of cash within Between what acquisition dividend share buyback and CapEx it unchanged Where if you wouldve asked even prior to the National acquisition were very simple when we sit with the board and is number one is growth growth could be CapEx for manufacture equipment growth could be acquisition growth could be RD growth could be SGA the thing you want to invest to drive it to drive the you at where we are feel very good and what mean by good the RD level where the RD is at the acquisition we certainly about National it to be a wonderful move to love it in the nearterm and love it in the longterm work to go do on then one of and the investor community it and hope they remember and keep it in mind the move we made in and to go secure what turn out to be about of asset for These wafer fabs theyre the PL theyre operating theyre obviously not fully loaded given where the industry is right now is to position u to generate tremendous growth with very CapEx incrementally my world say a good to have Most of our competitor in fact a very few of them have ability to grow upwards and the cash flow implication when we grow this place it to be good accordingly Once you get those and those well covered it then come down to a balance of dividend and share buyback following the National acquisition we would moderate share buyback but not eliminate and watched u over the of quarter done much so we were absolutely fortunate in term of the timing of the National acquisition to be able to secure the financing at the rate we did a great there no rush to pay any debt off in term of the rate we have it our focus be to generate the cash and then take a good at the balance of dividend and balance of buyback u on the dividend front grow it for year now continue to step up and we are a believer dividend are an important element of return to investor a great wellrun tech can actually deliver growth can deliver equity opportunity but also could have a dividend component to it promised to allow a few question from the audience have some microphone in the room if anybody any please raise your hand get the microphone over to you Right at the back over there the final few year in the National independent there some chatter the margin structure too high and one of the reason they were losing share it seems your team actually discovered more because of their commercial having gone National at this point what do you would be the best to do at Nationals margin in order for you to maximize the profit the comment would make is would never use the statement too high when it come to margin if you at what occurred and the National folk tell you this directly you can go back and listen to historical call even in and timeframe Is not they had high margin but they kept trying to optimize or maximize margin percent a opposed to maximize earnings growth therein believe lied the core problem they had theyve great part great part could earn high margin but they had some initiative a looked even further where because they very enthusiastic about their margin improvement back in and they did some thing they wish they hadnt done and a lot of it to do with their commercial posture to customer were not up and down the hallway of Nationals saying Lower margin can assure you What were doing is through the hall of National a witnessed by the world tour get out and sell grow with the customer and be aggressive those lead you to being able to still have very good margin but a growing revenue base you can put alongside of the good news we had thesis a we studied it from outside and everything we have discovered a gone through so far is very consistent with which give u comfort the speed we can move to to a different way to operate actually happen very quickly biggest people of and in some way this world is simple National great design engineer great design engineer number one great designer want to do is see their part successful They want to see their part in customer application and growing so the enthusiasm from the National community about coming in been very high what they see is an opportunity to do what they havent been able to do for the or year where continue to feel encouraged by what found real quick question National a far a the itself is there much overlap or have they gotten you into any product area you havent been in before a far a there are millimeter millimeter fabs assuming you operate them a a stand alone for the being whether it is the endgame of to eventually fold them into the millimeter building secondarily of a separate subject a far a DLP and of it future within where you see heading Lets see if could keep those on the top of my head off and you need to tell me are the slide the showed at the Wednesday session up on the web or not they were only at the session Out at the meeting we held on Wednesday we walked through those unit and gave some very good example where there capability complement we did not have there some low noise data converter lower forget the exact device on front youll find a very complementary set especially in the signal chain can match up to some of the processor They had and we talked about it at announcement you at the power area they tend to have higher voltage range so it tends to be better optimized for industrial of the great thing we wanted out of the National deal to take u closer and deeper into the industrial market everything we see is saying theyre to be able to do for u we feel good along those line the wafer fab commentary and Ill go ahead toss the assembly test site theyve wafer fabs one in Portland one in Scotland Portland is all inch Scotland is almost fully converted to inch we have a very simple plan and it back to prior and is to go sell and get them loaded up do there are some thing we can do working with the team at those site to get their cost per wafer better but the site competitive and we good line of sight on how to run them well same with the assembly test site Lastly on DLP it one of those interesting one were to many in the investment community is the DLP TV era wound down or year wasnt to be everybody tended to commiserate no growth would occur is actually back to prior record high in term of revenue and is combination of the front projector space the digital cinema space but there also some very exciting new growth area read about these Pico projector These miniaturized device a announced of a sled product would attach to a cell phone could find them now embedded on camcorder so if you shoot video you could play back and show people Back to one of Uches question we see application in the automotive space for head up display and other area a well even though DLP is in the other we actually it is an area is getting RD an area where quite a bit of excitement in term of potential revenue growth many part do you produce now on an annual if you lowered all of the factor you have bought over the last of year how many part would you be producing what percent of the industry would be after unit Oh in round number were unit annually right now maybe a to unit a but the ability to do with where we are in term of the percent of the market youll actually find it proportional on a revenue because average selling price is about what the overall industry is you go at the deeper math on particular front were not exceptional were not out of line either lower ASP or higher ASP when you blend everything together and where to be very careful to add it all up accordingly one last because were almost out of fine why by asking you a of real quick comment on the model how you see it shaping up eventually if you were to quickly people where you see this from a model perspective top line growth related to the industry margin and how confident you are from what so far of getting there in mix in it a you we have talked in general and if you at the piece shown we have the ability to do what we have called this the market which we have defined because we have a lot of engineer in general believe the semiconductor market an average growth rate over the longterm there a reasonable history can prove and if you depending on your assumption for longterm global GDP because of more electronics in our life semiconductor industry grows at about we believe we can take our and Embedded business including the OMAP and connectivity and grow those at an percentage point faster than the market an audacious statement in some way and it a statement depending on the investor get met cynically accept it also something very firmly in front of u in term of what we intend to go do a significant portion of our is capable of doing it and proven can do over and the one arent guess what off working on those If you at the best way to understand it is back in of revenue were in those core category of and Embedded and OMAP and connectivity it over so during timeframe actually been very close to pushing those type of level we have described we intend to keep pushing on If you at the fall through for the margin and this is another one get somewhat touchy depending on the investor is we provided a model guideline well it the or the analyst meeting at we a wellrun portfolio of and Embedded Processing should be able to achieve point of margin and pretax a we started getting near a or so we started getting into the let raise the bid and the cheering from the audience and we havent the reason we havent is and it almost back to the National good thing out of putting single point model up on the wall what we intend to do is grow the earnings faster than the revenue and hopefully grow the revenue faster than the market what exact margin be What operating margin be not sitting there saying here a single point to be able to drive can go at wellrun model and wellrun Embedded Processing or microcontroller business and get a of what could be and we certainly those number and we certainly hold people to type of benchmark not running around trying to lower the GPM or the operating margin but we are careful about getting a single point up on wall yet again be evasive on the and the operating model hear you been terrific you very much behalf of for coming appreciate it',\n",
       "       'go to of on the core percent of revenue being down about in wondering if you could give u a bit of color of how might play out between wireless and embedded not we the core number believe we broke out for the what you heard u what core did for the have a separate forecast for you into the other than the consolidated forecast we typically provide Do you have a follow on guess trying to get a of sort of the operating revenue incentive being versus maybe the Baseband OMAP and connectivity Is there any color you can give around the sequential expected growth relative to guidance for the Again typically what we tend to provide in guidance is the total revenue number this we well what you were thinking about when you core revenue when we told you the difference semi what semi which were in versus the total revenue because of the impact of calculator have a more detailed breakout across wireless or Embedded Processing Do you have a follow on Then quickly on the utilization front do you the is of at the bottom in utilization at what are you bottoming here we do expect utilization to decline further in the from the declining from the have a forecast a to whether or not it decline further in to be more of a reflection of our outlook a to what the and especially revenue might a it take further lead to build the material again we do expect utilization to drop a few more point in the from the but we have a forecast beyond we even tried to explain back at midquarter this is mostly a macrodriven downturn Now any customer reset their production level typically theyll also reset or rationalize their inventory level to new of production what we have and what we believe is the customer own inventory reset is largely behind u at this point our customer production and therefore our own shipment track with basically in demand which is more macro economically driven once we we have a reasonable view of but once we go beyond it tie to what the macro economy and which way tends to take in demand for our customer product and therefore how would drive around go next to of Do you have a a to whether or not actually undershipping distributor sellthrough suppose you would call it in actually in can you give u a a to the relative softness between OEMs and disti in term of basically we had sale out of our distribution channel down a of point of percentage point compared with the Yet against they were able to reduce their inventory level so you would translate to our shipment in were below their shipment out Therefore they were able to reduce the level of their inventory sorry you had another part of which is how the OEM compare relative to distribution again we have le visibility into OEM other than where we have consignment program which is significant OEM consignment program represents of our total revenue so we have good visibility there and absolutely we own the inventory keep it lean keep it high turning the about a or so of our revenue tends to be operated on traditional backlog and order entry system we have le visibility where would previously our view of what we actually saw in our revenue trend in the is customer because of the economic uncertainty basically reset their own inventory desired inventory level They accomplish reset earlier in the half of this and then revenue pick up somewhat a inventory completion inventory reset been completed not saying theyre off and running by any mean in term of their own production level but their inventory reset of component we is largely completed at this point Do you have a followon do couldnt help but notice in the list of phone you gave with OMAP a lot of those sounded they were phone someone else had in the Honeycomb generation of Android it sort of raise the of stickiness of op processor a we change generation of operating system wonder if you can give u a of how sticky do you OMAP be in Ice Cream Sandwich and then more importantly how sticky do you it be in the next generation of Google operating system want to imply any how would it we take any of these program for granted have to win our and rewin our everyday would the same for a lot of these customer been a longterm supplier of many product into their handset own view a Honeycomb a bit of an anomaly especially on the tablet side because there a race by many OEMs to have some type of demonstration product at last year Consumer Electronics show and drove at least what would very visible a when from maybe another supplier a would have described even back in last a lot of those same OEMs were demonstrating platform space on another supplier at Consumer Electronics Show we had active development program underway at same point in with OMAP the difference is we are a supplier theyve had a history with Theyre comfortable They we can support both their term a well a the of volume production requirement operationally these highvolume handset require were confident in our position with these various player at same we have proven over the year our ability to do a good job and rewinning every day were engaged with these customer we go next to of you had mentioned seeing some sign of a cyclical bottoming and you mentioned a slowing in order deceleration activity in August and Are there other thing seeing out there lend conviction we are getting close to a bottom the fact tried to identify thing one the order trend the one in general lead time are short which in and of itself is not indicative of a bottom but usually exists at the bottom of the cycle and then finally the fact blank on my one do you remember what it saw revenue profile shift to the there a another one mentioned anyway those were Ill find it here shortly a before inventory are lean both at OEMs and distributor so again we have additional depletion of inventory need to take place for growth to start to recover and again doesnt mean were at a bottom because again we be revenue go down in the especially if you compare on an applestoapples one Ill also note is if you at the delta to seasonal we are about point below our seasonal norm if you take the middle of our we would also be about point below the seasonal average one way of looking at is at least were not to the extent we accomplish midrange point in revenue for of maybe caught bumping on the bottom a opposed to operating in an environment is getting progressively worse well see how it land but our perspective Do you have a followon historically had a strong notebook peripheral power management position given all the flooding issue in Thailand is there anything is picking up would leave you uncomfortable with build activity in the for Crag a uncomfortable getting too far out of on the edge there because there certainly is a lot of uncertainty so and a rapidly changing situation but can walk you through some consideration is not have any facility there being we do have some assembly test subcontractor a well a a few component select supplier for example Some very lead our lead frame supplier do have some product a a result are impacted to the best been able to gauge our current assessment is it would impact potentially about of our revenue in the working with the customer are impacted working with them on contingency plan to work through this not include any impact to the customer themselves either customer are operating in Thailand or customer might have their own production plan changed because theyre unable to get supply from other supplier to have a more direct Thailand impact were trying to work through all a note we do have program where customer and these are program where maybe there are some sourcing type of arrangement on highvolume program such a hard disk drive where customer have contacted u requesting u to pick up additional support for product their other sourced semiconductor supplier might have been more impacted by Thailand from an assembly test perspective theyre asking u for upside support again were working through all best we can at least a it directly affect our production is very minimal impact but were still working with the customer to understand their end of it a well we go next to of of for the transparency around National very helpful trying to compare your guidance with the result if you exclude the onetime charge we get in pro forma EPS for if we do the same for we get applestoapples excluding charge EPS is down over guiding sale is down only or so whats driving the much larger decline in pro forma EPS among the thing we talked about you a you point out lower revenue about worth of the delta there also expecting lower utilization about of the delta expecting mentioned to during my remark the reduction in OpEx we saw in the due to some catchup adjustment for accrual on variable compensation Those not recur in the and so cause our OpEx if you want to go up by about also had a benefit in the from a lower tax rate from a catchup adjustment similar in the be on a we expect a recurrence of about then finally well have a full quarter worth of National Semis OpEx in our number and about in transition when you run the math how you get to the again from the to the in both case where acquisition cost are excluded Is right Correct to make emphasize when talked about the return of OpEx had been reduced in reduction in OpEx included component basically ongoing reduction and then the component basically the catchup for the fact we had been accruing compensation expense at a higher rate during the half of the the ongoing reduction continue into the the catchup amount doesnt recur result in some sequential increase in and a very similar story on the tax reduction in and a slight increase then in sorry the Do you have a followon one quick one buyback appears to be holding up quite well do you at a we go through this softer macro Are you allocating a certain percentage or cash flow to it or how are you strategically looking at buyback activity there a number of different element to go into it a we had indicated when we announced the acquisition of National we would moderate the amount we spent on buyback versus what u in prior period largely in preparation for beginning to set aside cash reserve to begin to repay debt a it come due example National Semiconductor debt we acquired includes to be due on of next well need to set some cash aside through payback further into of course well have some of our own debt we issued for the acquisition coming due and well begin to build cash for all being we did announce last our of Directors approved an increase in our dividend by about from per share to per share effective this is part of how were returning cash to our investor well continue to return cash in the form of buyback albeit at a more moderate rate over the foreseeable future a we shift to accumulate some cash for some of the maturity of the debt when it come due we go next to of would be on margin and what are to be the big driver of the margin delta from quartertoquarter over the next several quarter understand your comment about fab utilization driving about of the margin or utilization is driving of the EPS decline in the whats to be the most important mix versus fab utilization versus even for the next some of the expansion issue on the National inventory the biggest driver next is to be the market fair value of the inventory we acquire from National Semiconductor Theres a basically there to be almost worth of additional cost in cost to revenue would normally not be there if you do the math on fall through on an aftertax of somewhere around to clearly weighing u down until we get through fair value of adjustment you already pointed out also lower utilization be weighing u down Once the utilization and certainly once the fair value adjustment is behind u well get a bit of a lift because wont be recurring addition a we begin to see the bottoming out mentioned and ideally the resumption of end demand on a morethangrowth vector utilization start being a benefit for u most importantly on the longer is with the acquisition of the National Semiconductor now amount to almost half of our total revenue from somewhere around the low to earlier in the on a goforward of mix help u Ill folk on the phone Nationals overall margin actually were higher than prior to acquisition alone should help up the mix a bit more importantly the total mix of revenue would become a bigger portion of revenue a we go alone help u a we march on our longterm goal to margin for the great Do you have a followon of a followup one and Ill you decide if you want to answer both or one would be assuming the expensing of the inventory is a one issue and to get all back then in the margin a we about the is with the increase in margin you get from National a you referenced is there any update or when might we hear an update to the longterm margin model of the What would you want to take one or one so maybe Ill give you both the expensing you are correct is a one issue by our estimate should be essentially complete when we through the and should have behind u a we enter the to increase in or in the model for the we want to be able to consistently deliver up to before we go off and start looking at a new model for the well hold to the model had for several year now which is and operating is what were trying to design the to operate at go next to of can ask you real quick on connectivity and the Wireless we have OMAP grew baseband grew but connectivity down you about thing one is whats causing shift in connectivity visàvis the rest also how much more resilience shall we expect in the baseband you how much more what your last what is the outlook for the baseband Should we still contribute more of to go down Connectivity is straightforward be a bit awkward of a response for what become obvious reason but our largest connectivity customer currently are not doing a well in the marketplace a some of their peer a a result connectivity revenue not held up a well a some of our other a for example the OMAP revenue keep in mind there also mix even within the customer for example our connectivity product line tends to be very it tends to be centric around WiFi and combo use WiFi or centered up on WiFi and so again tends to be the very highest end of the customer product while smartphones are doing well overall the mix within some of our customer been stronger at the lower end where we supply connectivity versus the higher end where we are engaged then the outlook for baseband is unchanged again what this is the of noise we have told you to expect in baseband where during the half of the we had some inventory reduction taking place at our customer represents a bit of a snapback from moved above we call historical or the linear trend line the best guidance we can give you is draw a straight line between of this and of being zero a rough approximation of how we expect revenue to trend again we expect it be completed essentially by the end of if one or question but do you have a followon Separately can ask you about moving sort of the part in the guidance so obviously x the contribution from National Semi Are there very end market where we didnt want to describe a bottoming process Are there end market where we are seeing stronger or weaker a we at somebody else had taken a run at and we a aware we break out our revenue forecast by various end market youll have well have certain area better than others but we were not forecasting again keep in mind the pressure were feeling on demand is economically driven maybe more so on the consumer side than on the enterprise side but it economically driven which tends to weigh much across the board a in thing generally across the board were well below seasonal had the same of expectation in the we go next to of my is on the supply chain and inventory Are there area from your perspective still seem lean on the other side are there area which seem they need to digest in inventory a mentioned earlier a we at certain supply test we see where inventory are at our distribution inventory a mentioned were down about a day still holding there at about week consigned inventory and our consignment customer continue to be very lean by definition because they pull only a they consume represents about of channel we can see other which is more classic direct sale to OEMs we have great visibility there but we also have a lot of concern there given broadly speaking we actually came out of a bit higher than we expected versus the midquarter update from a variety of customer actually material a bit more than we expected in the those signal all tell u the inventory is at good shape across the entire our customer base and where we supply at Do you have a followon do on in term of other income is there any guidance there then also can you update u on the capacity of your millimeter and expansion plan the other income the main you saw in the excuse me interest expense of about an allin for the debt now hold and hold for a of year be a bit higher be about and be adding in the debt we assumed with the acquisition of National Semiconductor the main change point you to on the other income and expense to the Miho fab we have a you been ramping factory for some now especially step up the ramp pace when the earthquake happened in Miho a Miho hold a lot of product continue to ramp product into factory total capacity for what purchased equipment would generate about when it all loaded a we indicated up to worth of revenue out of factory considerably below a we continue to ramp fact our current level were running about of capacity other point need to make is the reference is equipment we have purchased and inhouse which a aware only represents about half of the floor space of fab we have lot of room for expansion but we also have plenty of equipment already on the floor were ramping into again lot of room to grow even within the equipment we purchased but lot of floor space beyond we go next to of Capital guess in term of your comment on seeing stabilization if seeing across the board or to any certain end market guess wed the size of stabilization were more a of if were seeing a bottoming process beginning to fall and not so much stabilizing a evidenced by the fact we still expect our revenue to be down next again it more important to note what we were seeing through our order pattern through our lead time and through overall inventory well begin to see the bottom of this demand decline begin to shape or form a bottom although it not there yet because again we expect to go on do you have a followon Capital a a quick followup to revisit margin If at the OpEx guiding in other income or other expense rather it look guiding margin roughly flat so guess a is correct then b once we get through selling of the inventory without margin should we be thinking we get immediately back up to another bps higher on the margin side even without a pickup in utilization should we about not how building your margin assumption in your model would point out there is about in cost to revenue in the depress our margin on a GAAP quarteroverquarter addition we expect lower utilization would be another more pressure on margin from standpoint If extracting then maybe where getting your margin to be roughly flat quarteroverquarter not what your assumption is there but would want to point out those item mentioned Right a you alluded already be about or point approximately pressure in the be completely gone in the there may be other thing about in of course inventory the expensing of the inventory write up is a effect only and then it be cleaned out by the we get into go next to of the National acquisition you threw out a target of in cost saving Do you still feel confident in target and anything surprised you on the upside or the downside with the acquisition so far in the integration on the cost saving we still hold to forecast to the other listener on the phone what we were talking about there is by the end of the after acquisition so be in the of next wed expect to have enough of the redundant cost removed we would see about of annualized cost saving or about a starting about a from now we still expect to be a reasonable forecast for planning purpose to any surprise on the upside or downside it a too early for u to find any of those yet been focused here on and the management team getting out and visiting with customer on the world tour and focused on updating our online system and our marketing material to be able to make this a seamless appearance to our customer and there one place to go all plus part in it also been focusing on the beginning step of the overall integration of our system and methodology not enough yet to have plus or minus beyond we can about add we mean of course this acquisition is hugely important to a a result we understand it also important to our investor you see ongoing progress update and lot of detail from in term of our progress there stay tuned youll see them a we get them Do you have a followon guess one more a more broadbased on National now had a chance to at least take a at it peek under the cover kimono or whatever you want to call it what do you are the or key to sort of turning around the share loss there what sort of landmark can we at Is there any sort of frame there what did you find a you looked under the hood the encouraging we found early on is certainly from Greggs tour with his manager reception gotten from those in our distribution channel and importantly from our customer been extremely encouraging sound bite keep gravitating to or hearing if you is customer Nationals part were glad they can now comfortably and safely design them back in to their future product actually find very encouraging Beyond we clearly have some challenge in front of u also which is making we are able to integrate the company from an overall process standpoint to be our system integrate properly and we wind up the blind spot and hole and so on which are always challenge when you make an integration of this size it been exciting for some of the National management have been out on this world tour a well because what they mean theyre finding a reception a part of they havent been used to for a while so there is a refreshing upside theyre seeing make them excited to be part of a well go next to of want to confirm my math is correct National add about the to revenue in and it be about guess excluding acquisition charge about dilutive to EPS Am in the ballpark is thinking about the EPS can confirm in the ballpark the of revenue it add some to EPS on a proforma we need to be careful on a GAAP because in fact we have an increased acquisitionrelated charge mentioned of acquisition cost plus of the fair value markup of their inventory go to cost to good sold Right the amount go through be reported a part of our which is more of the ongoing operation be profitable Youre not too far off in term of your estimate there again exclusive of all acquisitionrelated charge do you have a followon saw you reiterated your CapEx guidance for the you share with u your thought about into and how managing headcount in this environment the CapEx we havent given a forecast yet would you we did take advantage of the downturn and acquired substantial capacity especially in the more expensive wafer fab side of the CapEx build during the last month or so which implicitly mean our need to spend money on portion of capital should be lower than normal for the next of year Beyond well continue to spend of course on our some of the test operation model is to under the CapEx spend the fact if you take a over the last month actually spent about of revenue on CapEx with depreciation running at about of revenue consistent with where been expect those of factor to apply to staffing we do continue to hire people certainly on a selective in the area where we expect to grow and those would be in and Embedded Processing a well a in field app engineer and talented salesperson remember please remember we hired over new employee from of clarification quickly the midpoint of the pro forma guide excludes inventory writeup on the National side if we x out off the you have to worry about it in the reversing itself is correct Correct then guess a bigger picture whats your assumption for the inventory level in the Is your guidance assuming the inventory get burned further stay the same rise et cetera we intend to provide a lot of breakout there me distribution inventory is very consistent with where it been historically anticipate to see a big change there again at were over week at the current again we went down a day even in the one would is with National there adjustment on with distribution in general there there can be some slight realignment they finished or what we had in the channel there when we completed the about week of inventory historically they tend to run to week then youll see over further adjustment there a we implement consignment program with distribution and those type of valueadd program again be over the course of and literally be year a we implement Did you have a followon quick the in synergy you plan on with National shot at how much of come on the OpEx line rather than the COGS line Virtually all of it on OpEx To all of you for joining u of this call is on our this today call you for your and have a wonderful day',\n",
       "       'well take our from with you mentioned in the preamble you werent to about operating margin or profitably but of the EPS line is holding up much better than the revenue on the new guidance of if you could walk me of through the put and take of whats driving quickly are you able to react on OpEx relative to the current environment versus what might be on in the mix of revenue there reason behind why you didnt see a more call it proportionate drop between EPS and revenue is we are reducing variable expense on multiple front in light of the weaker environment were currently in for example our compensation includes variable component such a bonus and profit sharing now revised downward consideration is with our lower profit outlook revised our annual effective tax rate estimate down to about from our prior estimate of a aware since we have been accruing both of those item at higher rate during the half of the we also then have a catchup in the accounting a catchup benefit in the explains the difference between what you might have expected for EPS to go to versus what were projecting here Do you have a followon you talked a about the variable cost you can go after on the fixed cost side anything happening to CapEx andor headcount term of CapEx no change to our guidance on in term of headcount would Ill actually change somewhat to hiring mean were actually still hiring for strategic program Hiring become much more selective you might in this environment were certainly keeping our resource focused on what we believe are the best opportunity were addressing but the hiring become more selective outside of no real headcount swing other than what might about from attrition move to the next please well go next to with could you a bit about the distribution channel what seeing there especially a far a inventory and lead time trying to understand how they are sort of reacting to this lower demand environment guess what would is we expect resale from our distribution channel to decline at about the same rate a our overall revenue therefore of midsingledigit decline on sale out of the channel expect change in distribution inventory level on an absolute Although with the declining resale they could be up somewhat on a day Do you have a followon should we assume by product line thing are tracking the same too trying to understand if maybe your Wireless is tracking seasonally better than let and Embedded Processing Not guess in general were seeing broadly lower demand across our product line and then a previously customer a well a market if you of walk through the we would expect both and Embedded Processing which are both very diverse business to decline Wireless likely be about even with the but also note the is traditionally our Wireless segment seasonally strongest so flat is weak for for our Wireless would note our OMAP application processor revenue we expect be up strongly compared with the while connectivity revenue be down due to customer bit mix Baseband revenue likely also be up Finally our other we would expect it to be up mostly due to DLP revenue benefit from increased output from our factory in Miho Japan you might recall product line and certainly factory impacted by the earthquake and the subsequent shutdown there let move to the next well go next to with can you maybe comment on internal inventory and what the plan are for the utilization rate from an inventory standpoint a you might assume inventory and inventory day both move up this a we had planned operationally for a stronger demand environment than what is evidenced to u being we had already reduced production start even coming out of although there be some lag before action would impact the inventory even coming out of youll recall in the we during the of is when it started to become evident to u we were seeing below seasonal forecast out of our computing and various consumer customer and led to our guidance for our to be below seasonal again during the of we had already started to take action to lower utilization rate production start again there until work through the system there wont be an immediate impact on inventory Ill also note the inventory we had in place for the most part are longlived catalog product where there practically no risk of obsolescence Do you have a followon to follow up on your commentary you about the linearity or trend of order and booking for this and what it would mean for want to linearity but order are weak and we expect in total order be down from the well move to the next well go next to with in one of the thing we saw happen the channel taking inventory below normal level because of the panic associated with the financial crisis my is to what extent do what seeing now from your customer the lower demand is driven by serious concern about the market and people wanting to destock inventory and take them below normal is this do you a reflection of your customer reacting right to the weaker demand environment believe the latter we do not believe what were encountering would be a typical semiconductor inventory cycle Macroeconomic weakness is resulting in broadly lower demand from both consumer and enterprise and a our customer been or faced with lower demand for their product of course they rationalize their inventory level the real root issue is demand not too much inventory youll recall we described in some detail back in we believe inventory were in good shape both in our distribution channel a well a the high percentage of customer OEM customer where we have consignment program again we had reasonable visibility in inventory level and they seemed fine of course a people forecasted customer forecasted their demand go down then of course they rationalize inventory level a well Do you have a followon Some company are seeing higher commodity price impact their margin is this impacting you would to some degree mean item gold certainly are a factor in our cost and theyve commodity in general have gone up but we now or certainly in either be able to quantify specifically move to the next please go next to of what do you get from the of your lead time versus your competitor lead time reason ask trying to get of how much of the incremental revenue weakness talking about is a function of the fact if your lead time are a longer than some others maybe this is to catch up from what others are seeing or if this is an incremental down for everybody we can answer our lead time we would characterize are at normal level would also includes Mihosource product where you might recall we described in lead time had been extended for those product were manufactured there given the supply constraint much resolved those and have lead time back to normal level are we leading or lagging in term of versus what seeing from others well you make assessment Do you have a followon good next please go next to with wanted to about the utilization you you are bringing down is to try to control inventory flow through to the margin line Do you expense or it have to work it way through so the margin impact is actually delayed by a or so the margin impact is felt immediately we expense essentially any cost impact associated with underutilization we expense in the current and all of our inventory is valued at standard cost Do you have a followon do a quick one for clarification you talked about the Wireless performing roughly flat did hear right both OMAP and Baseband would be up if so connectivity have to go down a ton to offset those rising heard right OMAP is up strongly Baseband we expect to be up and connectivity offset growth in both of those area correct well move to the next go next to with Would you expect margin to be up given the reduction in variable expense we specifically break out guidance on even with our end of the guidance we get it down to the margin level wont specifically address Ill a bit about maybe some of the put and take talked about even last we would have le impact from the cost associated with the shutdown and the various operational disruption we had in Japan would be a positive factor also to last Certainly utilization weighs on margin although would to a lesser degree than if you go back a number of year because and Embedded Processing tend to be le capital intensive and relative to revenue those fixed cost would tend to be lower a a percentage then some of the positive offset of course tax wont have any impact on cost of good although some of the variable compensation piece would flow through cost of good a well Do you have a followon understand the deal hasnt closed yet but previously you talked about in synergy from the National acquisition Is there any change there given the overall environment not at all can provide a brief update in term of where we are with National and closing and it is unchanged from what we talked about previously though we had previously we have cleared all the antitrust review were something to various review we went through around the world of those are clear with the exception of China which remains underway have National their shareholder approval of course occurred on believe it and we have all of our funding in place again the only were waiting on is the clearance through China encountered no obstacle taking longer there a we had initially expected soon a we get the China approval youll see u issue a public statement and then we would expect to close the transaction within a few day of notice respect to synergy this remains about accelerating revenue growth at National a well a we do they have not grown consistent with the market overall believe we how to turn around and get their growth in very consistent with what from which is a very significant outperformance relative to the market revenue synergy is the for the acquisition and for the return we believe we can drive on acquisition a cost standpoint we continue to expect we be able to achieve about of cost synergy and have run rate annual run rate achieved about month after the close of the acquisition hopefully help move to the next well go next to with of what is your of the industry broadly Is this downturn looking a one issue or do you it could persist in the Also understand visibility is sort of limited right now correct guess what would is since this downturn is macro driven have no special insight into how long it take By contrast in an inventorydriven correction we can make some assumption about how much excess inventory exists and the burn rate of inventory to then estimate what might be the duration of the correction this case all can is were confident well return to growth whenever consumer and enterprise spending start to increase again and well you make the estimate on when might be Do you have a followon one other one why connectivity would be down but OMAP and Baseband up in Do they generally track each other is there some other competitive issue at play here Not a competitive issue simply a of customer mix sell connect there some overlap in our OMAP and our connectivity customer but not complete would describe some of our biggest connectivity customer have not been performing a well in their market recently and seeing in our connectivity revenue again would describe it a much more a customer mix consideration than any of a competitive consideration Lets move to the next well go next to with Capital Capital guess term of end market hoping you could provide a granularity there of the put and take seeing guess in context of consumer and computing a being highlighted the area of weakness in what seeing a of so right we identified consumer and computing a area where we expected below seasonal result in the current Whats different is basically we see broadbased weakness across more customer and market example in we described the industrial market still stable for u it weakening in general would describe a market trend a all broadly weaker without any major exception Do you have a followon Capital do guess the poor visibility you have uncertainty to the timing of recovery given how you stated it macro driven what your plan are inventory growing QonQ and would love to hear your thought on your plan for utilization and how we should about the impact there to margin in the next or were not to give you a completely satisfying answer other than saying what before which is we have pulled back on production start began process in Utilization we would expect to be lower this than a a result of Utilization is one of many factor on margin previously we also have some we have put a well a take such a lower Japanrelated cost but Ill leave it there well move to the next well go next to with USA on your balance sheet inventory guess there were day coming into the and historically there were a low a day wondering whats the right way to about number well short a day go higher over the longer there been a noticed a trend where our inventory level have tended to move up partly a nature of our product mix and a our revenue get centered op more and more on and Embedded Processing and especially the catalog or standard product piece of those product line a they become a bigger part of our revenue those tend to be more offtheshelf type of model certainly versus custom product where we tend not to build until we have a customer commitment in hand good news is those catalog product a described before in many case have a plus product life the risk of obsolescence the risk of inventory tends to be very low is some cost associated with but again the opportunity and the relative profit associated with those catalog product certainly justifies the cost of carrying it other would mention and heard u about this for sometime is inventory tended to move upstream from distributor and from our OEMs to a implemented more customerspecific program such a consignment frankly yes there is some cost to in term of carrying inventory but there a huge benefit from the standpoint of inventory is positioned where it most flexible and it also positioned where we have the greatest visibility the risk in the of various player hoarding inventory during time when the market are hot and then having to deplete inventory and what amplifies in term of the cycle on our be improved anyway by u carrying inventory versus having it downstream from Ill leave it with do you have a followon USA the end market discussion you most of the end market are weak but PCN consumer they have been weak for a while wondering mean are they continuing to weaken or at this point have they stabilized to a certain would theyre weaker than where we were expecting in in what we were seeing not we have those market weaken or turn down versus we werent seeing customer forecast seasonal growth in those market would they had again it wasnt a turn down it lack of growth would at this point we would describe both of those have weakened might also be interested in from a geographical perspective one happening there a we expected from a positive standpoint is we are seeing some lift out of Japan a those various customer get their factory online were seeing postearthquake recovery happen consistent with our expectation move to the next please need to be our last set of question go next to with real quickly wanted to probe on the OMAP comment you made about it being up strongly how much of is seasonality and how much of is new design win and for u to gauge how sustainable strength is beyond this season is clearly new design win it not seasonality tie very specifically to program won worked for some and we have customer now ramping or preparing ramping program into production preparing for their product launch guess is the best way of saying in general were very confident in the strength of our design pipeline for OMAP product and go across a broad of customer in both the tablet and smartphone market Theres still a lot of work for u to do to turn those program into revenue and well our result there speak for themselves not to try to give you a forecast for OMAP we have a solid ramp of program part of what were experiencing with a lot more of those yet to Do you have a followon do Baseband mean please correct me did heard you it to be up Baseband we do expect to be up Was a or mean wanted to clarify before ask my are we still is it planned still to ramp this down to or technically wind this down by the end of which is what in the the reason ask this is been resilient for much longer than one would have expected and should we still be modeling this to technically be gone by the end of a great and exactly right expect by the end of be ramped down revenue ramp down such we have no revenue to speak of there in what is youll recall the last quarter we saw very sharp decline in our Baseband revenue customer there obviously adjusting both based on their new run rate but also taking care of some inventory of their product so youll see a bit of maybe seasonality back maybe also a bit of call it the small snapback from inventory correction we saw in the itll be a bit lumpy but the Baseband revenue we do expect to decline through the end of next before we end the call me you the is on our you and good you everyone today you for your',\n",
       "       'go to with or if you can give u your rundown on for various end market is it and consumer a weak or is there anything else a weaker or stronger than seasonal for would it the area noted below seasonality again this is from input from a few of our larger customer and would most of them tend to be Asianbased are limited to computing and again some of the consumer market when some of the consumer market specifically would note television and maybe some of the gaming area where some and again when softness it not necessarily relative to but we havent the pick up we might otherwise expect coming into a stronger half If could of walk through some of the other area Ill you Ill touch on automotive Automotive although actually up for but would describe the gain is slight it wasnt a decline and reflects what were seeing in the broader automotive market where for example in the were seeing weaker than expected sale believe the consecutive of weaker sale tying more to the overall economy in consumer spending a well a possibly to the tight supply of car due to supply chain issue coming out of Japan Handsets the part were focused on being smartphones continues to do well well see where the land but at least coming at this point something growth compared to last and we have a good position there with connectivity and with our own map and a position is only getting stronger especially on the OMAP front a we move While on communication side wireless infrastructure reiterate what in the remark Most of what been driving u in half is basically data capacity expansion in North Theres growth in Europe a well but would describe growth a at a slower rate China and India have not been big driver thus far this but we expect rollouts in those country to drive better growth in half again mostly North half Industrial guess would describe it steady Look at the catalog area both on what we our comment we had about highperformance and power then would also at the comment we made on in catalog embedded processing product lot of those type catalog device tied to broader industrial market and would very steady result so far a broad sweep Do you have a follow on last on your own inventory inventory day remain in the low do you feel about of inventory day specially considering what usually happens in then what would be your utilization rate forecast for this on the inventory if you take a on the balance sheet and at the mix of inventory youll actually see our working process up more than normal it partly our raw material up more than normal and a function of making we procured enough raw material postJapan earthquake so we wouldnt have material shortage in our factory addition youll see our finished good are up some of is the seasonality due to the calculator backtoschool sale and a bit of is the plan to build semiconductor product the work in process is where you see most of the build up and to a large extent not only a plan to build to get ourselves back to customer service level been trying to achieve now for last year but also the result of bringing up our new factory and dual calling part were in the Miho factory damaged last with the earthquake you get multiple effect on driving inventory up of the inventory stage we actually feel quite good about if the want to turn out to be a stronger than the current signal suggests to u were well staged to be able to meet growth customer actually need product sooner inventory for well about in day when we get out of this and see what happens at point in with utilization Ill comment utilization down a bit in the prior the versus prior and a function of we do start adjusting loading in and continued through at the same we also have underutilized capacity a talked about in the Japanese factory were damaged together those have cost utilization to be down go next to with sound by the way given the guidance and visibility is certainly low wondered if you at where potentially you could see upside because it sound from a commentary maybe how thinking about it Where would you possible if at all then a part of answering you also you want to stay flexible recognize inventory maybe part of but what else is involved in staying flexible for your customer would on the upside be exactly those area where had suggested where were seeing some softness or some lackluster growth forecast from our customer be in the computing space and in the consumer space and with the TV and some of the gaming area were looking at it also not out of the a these component shortage finally clear themselves up in the automotive space you may see a resumption of demand in area a well an upside standpoint Ive already discussed the inventory profile at the same were also managing not the inventory we have but our overall factory load and our overall spending plan a we go into the half of the to be we have spending getting up in front of our revenue growth one would comment from the factory load and talked about this for some but maybe one positive consideration came out of Japan the fact were now getting more of our part qualified in more factory which give u more degree of freedom when demand want to upside were not limited to a particular factory and how much headroom we might have in one factory have more opportunity at more factory in this case with of the factory being new factory clearly we have a lot of headroom for upside to support there a needed Do you have a follow on do Kind of switching gear thinking about the opportunity in PCs you see for OMAP wonder if you can give u a a to how important you opportunity is maybe put it in these term if you only had opportunity for OMAP opportunity do you it be substantial enough for you to continue to work on OMAP Boy Glenn a tough to answer because we even envision at all mean clearly mobile is our priority with OMAP are highly focused on the smartphone space and the tablet space and frankly were not pursuing a aggressively in the idea of OMAP somehow or ARM trying to work it way into a standard Probably the opportunity we would view would be more to the degree tablet cannibalize into the lower end of the space or into the netbook space opportunity for OMAP is such a significant opportunity for u and one where we are to some degree in the driver seat from the standpoint of the penetration we have and the value proposition we have with OMAP and then in our mind make a lot more for u to focus on than to go try to penetrate a mature market such a the with OMAP realize wasnt a direct of an answer a you wouldve liked but it reflects our priority which continues to be smartphones and tablet then we are pushing OMAP into other space such a eReaders GPS device thing but those certainly would be a higher priority for u than chasing down the traditional more mature market go next to with maybe you can a bit about linearity in the guess whats changed or there been a significant amount of change since the update guess when did you start to see the issue in computing and consumer if we at linearity actually the from an order standpoint highly linear Each within plus or minus of a point linear in the Revenue built a we moved to the but order were highly linear Now what off the top of my head is what is the typical linearity for order in the what changed and Ill make some macrorelated comment he would but more bottom up is we started in the dialogue with customer in computing a in some of these consumer space they didnt in with the of new order ramp for looking into we might otherwise have expected do you have any more macrorelated comment whats change in area been a lot of the headline were seeing with European and debt issue and causing some of our larger customer to be making in the computer and consumer space do have concern and may cause anxiety among consumer and dampen demand a bit of a change from what we saw day or even day and it a reaction to a lot of unfavorable headline a it relates to the debt and what may mean to domestic demand in both Europe and the Do you have a followon what is your confidence then what were seeing in consumer and computing isnt a leading indicator of weakness it start to become more systemic through all the other and again we havent we havent sign of it elsewhere to the degree it macro and want to spread we have any direct visibility into but we certainly have not sign of to this point what were seeing sign of again is not weakening it not it not the typical turnout you might expect seasonally in some of those other area go next to with guess my what drove the strength in the distribution Asia resell guess my is are you seeing sort of softness in computing consumer this because there an inventory build of specific part in the an interesting we have perfect visibility we at the component inventory out there we maybe looking at it in different bucket is what we have at distribution Distribution now of course about of our revenue heard me were at over week of inventory which feel very appropriate wed distribution inventory is fine next bucket would be OEMs where we have consignment program by definition fine because were managing inventory we keep it lean we keep it fast turning if you put distribution plus consignment together you end up a north of of total revenue for more than of our revenue we have good visibility and we feel good about the inventory level are out there the remaining of our would describe we have direct visibility but at the same were not aware there are significant inventory issue out there we feel in general good about inventory but your point is your is a good one which is once something move our distributor and is into their customer we lose direct visibility and we what the inventory trend are out there again were not aware of any inventory issue Do you have a followon Followon for around profitability how do specifically about margin in the me to of get to the low end of the EPS Ive to take a healthy hit to margin conversely despite the weaker revenue outlook you havent cut RD outlook of a to why and what would you need to see to actually address the RD outlook down on the margin not how building your model there but would you in the we had about of net cost attributable to the earthquake in Japan almost all of cost went against the margin line we indicated we about another worth of cost we expect in the and again go against the margin line not quite how building your model thatll be driving the margin down fact seems it would go a bit different for no other reason we have the same of overhang on earthquake cost we did this to the RD spend RD a these are longterm of spend These arent the sort of thing you tend to swing around too much in the short so a watched u for a lot of year now when we set our RD spend budget for the we rarely fluctuate much more than plus or minus around budget from the excuse me plus or minus around budget we set at the beginning of the because the whole intention of RD is spending not for this year revenue and sometimes not even for next year revenue but for revenue beyond would not anticipate making change to this year forecast for RD Wed have to see something of a similar drama we saw coming out of into early for u to change our spend plan on front see on the horizon right do not go next to with USA you mentioned there some impact on OMAP in Nokia being weak if you at the OMAP and connect it with your what percent of is still Nokia and how should we about it have cant tell you what percent of OMAP or connectivity is a any particular customer to reiterate what we previously is our OMAP and connectivity customer base is much broader than our baseband customer base where to a large part we were building product for a single customer we feel good about the diversity of revenue and frankly it getting even more diverse a we especially in the OMAP space have a lot of new design win are basically in the pipeline of moving from development into production let over the course of the next again it a more diverse customer base but cant break it out any finer for you than Do you have followup USA you classified about of your sale a noncore obviously whats to happen to the Baseband but a to whats your strategic plan sort of for the remaining of the noncore strain of the restaurant is made up of a variety of product example our calculator is in there enjoys great market share especially in the North American education market and a market continue to grow although at very low singledigit of growth rate DLP is in area and also continues to do very well in some projection and some very interesting emerging growth opportunity particularly in Pico projector and other type of application of nature royalty are also in there normally expect much growth in area have some other custom ASIC is in area would characterize it a of very slow growth sort of area there a few other miscellaneous type of thing Overall if we at the noncore product area minus baseband because already talked Baseband run it way to by the end of but minus baseband the remainder were expecting to grow in the total of Again over the year into the future go next to with me reapproach the OMAP again it a few quarter when you had talked about running out product and being able to back and retake share were not seeing this you about what the outlook is for Especially now been launched is one of the fastest performing product in this category right now What is your a to the design pipeline and how should we about growth for the apps processor we feel optimistic about the outlook for growth in OMAP are doing very well with a of different customer and a of different product told you before in the case of OMAP we had something more than actually different OMAP based handset in the market and a handset count at the end of what can is with OMAP our designing rate been even higher and in fact higher than any prior OMAP generation there are few customer we publicly about because they have publicly announced their product in the tablet space would be RIM with PlayBook the smartphone space the LG Optimus product is OMAP based also launched OMAP in of this again we have a great pipeline of product and product technology even more importantly we have a great pipeline of design win in the smartphone and the tablet space then a previously we watch them develop over by area eReaders GPS personal navigation system thing find OMAP to be a great type of medium process or application processor for their space a well we it a good growth outlook from revenue standpoint and were certainly investing accordingly Do you have a followon slightly different on the wireless with the comm infrastructure in China comment you can make a to the rollout in the half of the not China but in general also a jump in for position with the PLD your ASIC versus PLD what is your a to who winning contest right now mean but your last this day you of talked about how your ASIC back into space any comment around the possible rollout in the half specifically on China then the ASIC outlook so would in term of China and India have a lot more granularity to provide other than what have which is we expect them to drive incremental growth in half of this we are wellpositioned in those market a we are in comp and infrastructurebased station equipment across the world a those system deploy in those region we clearly be a participant of PLD versus ASIC there actually a step beyond both of those which is systemonachip where we take the functionality historically wouldve been in the standalone ASIC or a standalone FPGA type of device and basically integrate it onto our DSP for a much more optimized system when you start thinking about base station and content more systemonachip for example related type of system we already have systemonachip for these system and mean our content be higher and frankly our content ramp earlier to the higher than what it might have historically again we have a great position DSPs and now surrounding DSP in a single chip implementation the logic give u more of a systemonachip functionality go next to with look the Baseband sort of the main delta in the how should we about now in the the best can is what heard u before which is of take the we were at in the and straight line it down in a linear fashion to by the you get to the we realize to have quarter are above quarter are below but the best forecasting approach we can provide you Do you have a followon fair is on linearity maybe not a much booking last but trying to understand how booking have fared so far in this are we off to a fairly normal start would it similar to it reflects the environment we described for you and the outlook we have provided in other word we have not in the week of a big ramp in order would be reflective of a strong backtoschool or holiday season and consumer or in computing but it of more lukewarm type of signal we previously described for you go next to with you tell me give me some feeling for how much lost production for Miho in might be baked into your guidance do you feel how fab been completely online and running could you have sold everything you ordinarily wouldve been making out of it would the lost production in this is about a talked about about worth of earnings Is loss production or cost Pardon me pardon me it cost also be some lost revenue because we cant sell the material until we get towards the end of the quarter come out of the factory towards the end of the we have a quantification for if would be right down because part of the outlook is changed versus what were trying to do to get color day when well be coming in the it relates to the overall lost output we have estimated it would cost u around worth of lost revenue of earnings in the and much about what it turned out to be have estimated the incremental cost would be about in the came in closer to about net of an insurance settlement the ongoing insurance settlement were able to achieve do you have a follow up regarding what seeing in auto right now do you guess the weakness sort of indicating for now is more supply constraint where if there if somebody else isnt shipping a part then the car doesnt ship and nobody who is sending part into those car ship anything Is the weak of weakness or is it more demand driven what are your expectation for market guess a we move into of the Do you it all normalizes out we have a great answer or visibility into the why of auto car sale are down are weaker than expected part of a large part of is supply chain related if they cant get a critical component from somebody else in the supply chain then they need the part we would sell into it much of it is the consumer nervousness based on of what talked about previously on at the macro theyre very likely could be some of a well but what we is supply chain impact to go next to with referred to shared gain in and Embedded Processing Is there any incremental color you can give on subsegments or end market where you you picked up some share can do it real broadly but if you take Embedded Processing and again it always a difficult at this point because we havent everybody el result to be able to extrapolate but clearly the strength of our position in comp infrastructure and the result were publishing here in space a clearly a contributor for gaining share in Embedded Processing it actually thing are more broad than mean if you at the catalog area we grew doubledigit level in catalog Embedded Processing revenue and the main driver of on the microcontroller side and a sequential number it stand to reason were gaining share in catalog microcontrollers and catalog DSPs a well both of those area are important for u when you get into the space me leave it at of where described before when you about the broad catalog space and includes both power a well a the broader HPA market you would have to catalog and therefore product sold through distribution product leverage the fact we have the number of salesperson a our closest competitor out there identifying opportunity and designing in our product would be the theme would for market share gain have an update at this point to take it down into it amplifier or product segment but the more broad catalog category would be the theme Do you have a followon a of your competitor in particular were vocal this about you being somewhat aggressive on pricing mean is of an isolated situation or is something more strategic on your part a you begin to fill up some of the fab capacity every a competitor loses share to we hear the pricing complaint coming back to u were doing anything different on pricing than what done historically Frankly our sale and gal are aggressive for pursuing new design win doesnt mean were out aggressive on pricing fundamentally believe when it come to when it come to Embedded Processing pricing is far down the list of customer consideration when theyre picking a supplier for a particular component thing and foremost the performance of the product the match of the product to the customer system need the amount of support can provide in the form of application engineer in the form of of factory capacity they see bringing online compared to our various competitor Those are the consideration drive customer decision to select versus a competitor Absolutely we have to be we have to keep our pencil sharp on pricing we have to be competitive on pricing but it not pricing causing share gain again it not the Ive heard then wont be the last Ive heard one go next to with of wireless operating margin came down in the which assume is due to the baseband decline question If baseband continues to decline continue to be an overhang on wireless margin longer wanted to understand if you do see growth in wireless but it come at much lower margin than and embedded then it still make to invest in this me address on the margin operating margin were down in wireless on a quarteroverquarter in part the margin dollar leave PL with the lack of revenue we have on the baseband another part of it is a indicated earlier we are seeing an increasing number of design win across a portfolio of product and in larger number of customer to support those design win were also increasing our staff to make we provide an adequate support thing on in there of them is the baseband revenue decline and this is associated to the margin coming out the other is the fact were increasing our support of customer a a result of u actually winning additional design win in term of looking to the future for quite a while the nonbaseband portion of our wireless need to grow and grow rapidly in order to get a certain amount of revenue base make to the financial model can tell you the leader of particular product is very focused on frankly with the design win they have been successful in getting at lately it is increasingly encouraging we may in fact begin to see more favorable result and certainly in for when the baseband wind down completely wont try to predict any decision a to the asked about when it make to stay in or stay out wont try to go there would simply point out once again with the design win there we have been adding additional resource to support those and were quite encouraged we should start seeing trend into meaningful revenue growth in the nottoodistant future would add the margin OMAP and connectivity run at are fully consistent with so what Kevins describing is more tied to the of investment were making on operating expense a opposed to a between those product line margin and what would see for example in or Embedded Processing Do you have a followon a quick followup there a slightly different topic you mentioned some of the conservatism you have around the consumer and computing you u how much exposure do you have to those area and how much do you expect to grow or decline versus your expectation trying to reconcile your consciousness versus the inline to stronger guidance we saw from Intel and of course understand your consumer trend are very different and can give you give you the state and secondly me comment though even our friend at Intel talked about lower unit than what they had previously been expecting for them it would translate to a richer mix suspect for were more sensitive to unit than mix given the type of product we sell in a opposed to their microprocessor if at half of this Ill walk down all the end equipment area and give you what percent of revenue Communications is computing industrial consumer automotive and education be and is primarily our calculator revenue me give you a subbreakout of computing because not all of these necessarily apply to our outlook PCs of sorry these sum up to the PCs in half are about Storage hard disk drive et cetera server monitor which is the DLP front projector revenue and printer would be hopefully help go next to with Capital Capital you guide to margin but it look at the midpoint it roughly up bps and guess the have is entirely due to the rolloff of onetime charge from Japan or is there also a mix issue here wont get into a whole lot of specific comment clearly the rolloff of the cost strike for Japan is contributing to what our expected outlook would be Beyond wont get into any further mix discussion on Ill leave a put on day do you have a followon Capital for housekeeping can you tell me what the actual share count exiting and should we be modeling tax rate for all of fiscal the diluted share count the average diluted share count for the and the share count basic share count These are the share we actually pay dividend on to the tax rate yes the revision given is a tax rate which we believe the tax rate should apply for the entire including the balance of the our prior tax rate guidance but it more rounding up to or or change something rounding up to is correct correct similarly were rounding down to right now To To so in reality the delta is a few tenth of a point in the tax rate but we our guidance is not granular well have for more please well take our final from with margin and well backwards so maybe you can a bit more about it If we yearoveryear in the realize you have charge this and even a higher depreciation but the margin is still down a good point you walk u through quickly what is the cause of the highest to at is right it down about point versus a the single biggest driver is the cost of the earthquake damage we talked about point of delta Utilization is another point Keep in mind we brought on additional capacity during this there about point or so attributable to slightly the lower revenue and another point attributable to yearoveryear change in pay and benefit and raw material cost and commodity and so on mix doesnt have any implication at all Not enough to make a difference these are the larger moving piece are on there guess my quick follow on on the midquarter update you talked about the disti resale you hope to be up of midsingle digit you theyre up or is splitting hair to notice any difference there or is there something on Resales were up and off the top of my head recall specifically what we were saying midquarter If saying midsingle digit could they were point or off but recall number and recall the variance been here shaking his head neither one of u can help you on one so with you for joining u of this call is on our again today call do appreciate everyones',\n",
       "       'take our from with guess the is given the hiccup on the Baseband this how should we about you expect a seasonal recovery when you at the guidance for how would you have u model would unchanged from what we have told you in the Although certainly it look guidance more and more opportunity to to fruition here which is basically we still expect by the end of revenue be essentially gone so of a linear progression from where we were in down basically to in would be about the best we could provide in term of guidance a my followup when you at the op profitability on the on op revenue operating profit were down almost of if you can a bit about pricing in currently also when you at the weakness in the highperformance market is expected to rebound in the why so weak for profitability down back to the initial comment made about our increased investment in certain project and Embedded Processes a similar story hold in Embedded Processing a well have stepped up our spending on product development in those area addition a mentioned were increasing our sale people and field apps engineer in support of those area actually similar to what we did a in Embedded Processing Where we stepped up the investment there done it again this stepping up the investment in both those segment you for your question and well move to the next please next is Capital Capital you plan how should we about your inventory it up a bit in this are you thinking about trending a you move into the Ill go ahead and take normally give a inventory forecast per se because more a function of what the following quarter outlook would be so we wont give you a number would you of what we talked about already taken action to start bringing the Baseband inventory down and so we would expect to decline during the Do you have a followon Capital you describe the outlook for the half of the you you expect a quite good half Where are the area you see the greatest ground for optimism around the half maybe a part of it did your booktobill your order number were strong in the maybe you can give u some color a to where you saw the best lift in the order book we believe it necessarily to be driven by any particular market fact part of the reason why were somewhat optimistic because we see it a being broadbased underlying strength certainly happened we in the remark there were some noise in the if you peel back much the isolated event one Baseband customer and a Japan earthquake underlying strong fact if you at the Baseband number we gave you them specifically see much decline of which about half of unexpected basically we had about a unexpected decline in Baseband had about the impact of the Japan earthquake on revenue since it came so late in the about you at where we were relative to our guidance we were below the middle of the but not very far below which mean area outside of Baseband and outside of the Japanrelated impact actually ran strong in the again we have to of get through and some of the noise associated with Japan we broadbased strength then become increasingly evident once we get into half again not driven by any particular area but rather broadbased you and let move to the next take our next from with maybe Ill go back to your comment on Japan regard to how your customer have reacted to it have there been any one would expect subsequent to an event there would be a jump in safety stock and people try to make they are not having any stockouts Did you see any such and of stabilized a we at how demand could trend for the rest of the also while answering if you can also about any adjacent product were hearing about wafer supply being tight still from Japan if exposed to or if any such comment is true on customer reaction to the earthquake again Ill go back to what actually saw quite strong demand during the month of the outside of the Baseband and direct Japan impact continued through the we can necessarily point to any example of where people might be moving to take on more inventory or safety stock by the same token an unreasonable for u to could occur a bit too early though for u to be able to point to any meaningful example of it relates to supply side is one of the thing were mindful of in the outlook a talked about before many semiconductor supplier is supplier of raw material to semiconductor manufacturer such a and others actually have the manufacturing facility in the earthquake zone in many case those particular supplier have been working to bring their factory back online been working with them a well a other supplier to try to ensure continuity to our total supply right now the situation remains too fluid to be able to give either from u or anyone else any certainty a to what supply situation until we get further through the did you have a followup to those question do a different and you talked about investing in both Embedded and Processing Embedded Processing and a of the reason for the margin weakness Is there any change in mix particularly if we at Embedded you where you talked about communication infrastructure a well a automotive being down is there any other more significant over in Embedded beyond investment may have resulted in the margin being a bit weaker Not outside of what we talked about always have some variation across catalog product or automotive or comm infrastructure which are the three category we discussed there other than what we discussed in our remark or put in the release there nothing jump to my mind would have been what would call a mix change Do you have anything come to your mind Not in those two segment specifically would broadly speaking at the we did about the cost of revenue took an impact for the Japan damage cost of about also mentioned royalty revenue down a bit quarteroverquarter addition to did mention in my remark the compensationrelated cost in our manufacturing area in the other area we had the benefit of the seasonal decline of vacation in the offset by paying benefit increase in the combination of event all pool together to deliver the GPM result we at you and well move to the next next is with for you maybe obviously now have down margin with all the goingson in the you maybe provide for u the path back to the mid on margin What are the thing need to happen sort of correcting for lack of a better the issue in Japan what else do we need to see to get u back to the mid would were to be a or two out on Keep in mind did mention there about of additional impact we expect in the related to the Japan earthquake excuse me in the and most of is to be in cost of revenue were in the before we see a resumption of those margin back in the we prefer to see them operating at an interesting point should be noted there brought up in his comment of our revenue in the our core product and those tend to be our product enjoy very healthy margin a we move through and Baseband continues it winddown and so on all those thing together and help support more reliable and solid margin starting in the half of the Do you have a followup do of endmarketrelated sort of brought up a bit but wanted to get your a to what seeing in a few end market wireless infrastructure automotive and industrial what you saw and what you expect to see in those end market Lets start with wireless infrastructure mean so we saw thing down there but is much a seasonal pattern we would expect to see what were driver of the revenue even though there a seasonal decline still most of the revenue associated with North American data expansion did see some increased volume in China in more of legacy GSM type of sale again we have no change to the outlook heard u about over which is we were at the start of a very long growth spurt to be based on data traffic capacity expansion to go across the world so on the one hand youll see CapEx spending increase especially in the wireless area we believe by various service provider we actually our opportunity to grow be actually significantly above those CapEx increase because were catching more the bill of material via integration for example we used to sell DSPs we sell Layer systemonachip the future were to be selling Layer systemonachip and capture more of the customer system opportunity via higherlevel service Automotive you heard u were strong lot of driven by unit sale increase in automotive in the of they were up something yearonyear is an area we believe the end market be impacted by the Japan earthquake and mean so much end market meaning consumer demand but rather the automotive manufacturer ability to supply given various constraint in term of their supply chain one were to watch strong maybe a more dampened outlook then industrial would good strength not only in view is the market to continue strong a we move through and would across multiple region Europe but also a you heard me in remark even out of China a they continue to expand not only their local economy but their supply into the rest of the world you and hopefully answer your Now well move to the next next is Barton with Barton and if you could go back to cost from the earthquake in the break it out a bit on our utilization charge scrap product restart cost and also your thought in all those category what could stretch into please we arent to go any lower than this data Right now were estimating about of cost and EPS and it be mostly manufacturingrelated some of be in those category you described a well a repair cost and other type of cost associated with bringing the line back up not to go any deeper than to it about or so in the we expect right now Try with another one Barton and go to in the Right now we cant see far out with a great deal of clarity so we withhold any of forecast on until we get closer to it give you more on in Ill give you one more Barton and Back to the booktobill Where it tracking before the earthquake and what after there is how much of an increase of booking did you see a customer tried to give you visibility andor create safety stock would describe the order trend a strong throughout the did see some turnup in the of week last week of associated with maybe customer a you described trying to provide more visibility not a big factor Booktobill and our order trend were solid literally from the start of the all the way through you and well move to the next next is Steve with regard to your comment about a good half what would constitute a good half for you If seasonal would be a good half indiscernible somewhat better than the seasonal should we about Do you have a followup mean Steve were already out on the limb trying to about in general thing turning back up in the half were sitting here trying to whether it would be above seasonal certainly a seasonalorbetter half is what we would characterize a a strong half and it of in the of thinking we have Do you have a followon had an aboveseasonal very solid booking here talking about this good back half and sort of in the context of some discussion of weakness out there and high oil price and debt ceiling and sort of a lot of negative macro data point how you sort of put those two together the negative macro data point and your seeming strength Is it share gain Is it something else If you could give some thought there you arent economist but any thought there would be helpful Again Steve what were seeing here is a general broadening of the economic recovery around the world including the Western economy been watching and it surprisingly weak for a long of along with the proliferation of electronic device give u confidence there to be quite a bit of longterm growth for semiconductor we talked in the last of call about our interest in the emergence of tablet PCs for example where our particular content in tablet is more than it is in PCs actually transition from weakness to tablet strength we view positively emergence of the data communication demand talking about earlier put more and more demand on the network and we have a lot of content those view very favorably fact automobile sale were somewhat depressed during the last of year a people of held on to their cash and their car are getting older they eventually have to replace some electronic content continues to go up those car Again give u confidence semiconductor content is to be quite attractive a we into the future no particular area and no debate on some of the macro headline talking about broadly speaking there underlying demand we saw even coming through this where people were a bit rattled all those headline you talked about including an earthquake we still saw strong demand good Steve you for your question and well move to the next next is with the royalty issue hit the margin Is expected to carry over to impact margin a well we typically forecast on but we the royalty would run in the call it the of on a quarterly Which is about where they were in looking we see a big transition Although a you royalty can always bounce around based on what happens with our licensee revenue and thing at a in in the we would expect roughly to hold through the rest of the Do you have a followon please the production issue out of Japan Is there any risk some of the share you were unable to satisfy or some of the shipment you werent able to satisfy this go elsewhere and are hard to get back do you you can of take them back a you ramp up production in other region there much concern on a share shift standpoint Again most of the product are designed in difficult or undesirable for many customer to want to redesign somebody else in Not impossible but difficult is a shortterm interruption and frankly were moving very quickly to qualify product into other factory the reaction from our customer actually been quite good so far at this point minimize any risk to our share position due to the earthquake would of it this way customer if theyre all the different direction they can put their energy it to be much more expedient for them to work on taking a device we used to manufacture in Miho and requalify the similar device we could provide them out of our fab than to go back to the design stage and try to redesign a board to use a competitor device again very very few of these device if any would be pinforpin compatible with competitor device They are highly proprietary so again what is and what encouraged is a intense effort to work with u on getting the of the device requalified over into other area while at the same were doing our best to recover production in Miho a fast a possible a well you and well move to the next next is with Capital repercussion for lead time not for your product What are you seeing in the industry Are there any complementary product where lead time are stretching out then had a followup a well clearly we had to adjust lead time to our customer for delivery for product were impacted by in the Miho factory aside from cant not aware of any others to point out Capital then my followup any buyer remorse after pulling the National deal do you have any remorse to spending to buy National Frankly cant enthusiastic about u getting deal closed you take a at the opportunity we have actually accelerated the growth of the National portfolio exciting incremental cost to accelerate growth exactly because we already have a sale force in place a soon a we can expose their product to time the size of the sale force we should expect to see a meaningful shift in a short order in the revenue growth of those product mean there are not very many opportunity to be able to pick up a product portfolio and a very highquality portfolio and basically be able to get it at a reasonable market price such a we were able to with this acquisition obviously spent a lot of out meeting with investor frankly the feedback from our largest investor been very encouraging regarding acquisition use of capital for acquisition and what they believe well be able to do with it they share our enthusiasm for bringing National team onboard and doing it a quickly a we can right you for your question and well move to the next next is with light of National acquisition and the fact investing a you pointed out in field sale and engineering change your dynamic it hasnt closed yet so you havent of the green light completely why add field sale and engineering when bringing on Nationals sale force and their engineer on top of it Is the growth opportunity strong it is Ed mean were continuing on our organic growth pursuit had all along Recall we spent the last and a half expanding our manufacturing capacity with the idea of rapidly growing organically our own internal portfolio of some odd product not changed and the expectation for each of those business our portfolio to have growth rate at running fair market not changed so in order to do we continue to want to add people in area where we see the actual growth opportunity at exciting part again for u is it incrementally quite easy for u to add the additional product Nationals portfolio bring to u into our sale people hand and on those same call now have an even higher probability of walking away with a sale every they show up with a customer so to reinforce because we used to get this a lot from investor whether our aggressive growth goal for would be purely met organically or whether we would do it via acquisition goal in turn for the organic growth not changed whatsoever and basically to be growing the market were continuing to execute the strategy to make we deliver on goal and then what well be doing with the National portfolio certainly be in addition to Ed do you have a followon to followup to one but so incrementally mean obviously you talked a lot about helping out National by adding so many more sale force to their foot on the street then you the National helping you out too and incremental to guess what your organic growth would be then expect certainly cut both way mean there a great sale people are hard to find and great FAEs are even harder to find were combining these team together and were encouraged already the largest sale force in the industry and it to be even larger the ability to multiply on growth standpoint is clearly in our favor and Ed familiar with National but forget the exact number Something of their recent revenue is coming from the industrial market and a much stronger position in industrial and a lot of it come because of the power management capability they have for highvoltage type of application so they have relationship with customer and certainly portfolio what do call leadin type product we be able to benefit from with those customer hopefully well go in selling microcontrollers DSPs and other product those customer might be able to take advantage of a well Ed you and well move to the next is with a bit more if we could on Japan you moved it sound more than you originally planned to other facility up from wondering what percentage of those part are already qualified or when do you they be qualified initially we had indicated somewhere around or so in ph other factory and since been able to increase to about Qualification is under way for many of those product already a function from two side to qualify it the factory theyre moving those product into the part is the customer to gain confidence part are actually working a they expect them to work to be taking u through this and maybe even the next on some of these product another data point would add is our fab these day we have about device qualified for production there and were adding about new device per week into our fab If you go back a before the earthquake or guess a more than a we were adding at a pace of about five new device per week in our fab certainly the acceleration happened since then is because of trying to move those Miho product and provide some production alternative there Do you have a followon the composition side had a or so to at this wondering how the composition of your existing inventory match up against the shortfall out of the Miho facility whether youll be able to draw down inventory to meet customer demand or whether there isnt a particularly good match there in the inventory set already material Miho had produced in our assembly test site had some finished good material a well had a better recovery of wafer than we initially anticipated after the earthquake thought more were damaged than we had actually believed to be the case initially between those some inventory to be able to handle our customer demand but clearly not enough which is why we are requaling many of those product into other factory it also why we had to reprofile the lead time on those particular part because we have enough material on hand to meet the demand of those customer you move to the next next is with you cant answer this definitively but how confident do you feel incorporating most if not all of the impact from Japan in vein are you incorporating any impact from any sort of demand disruption from Japan domestically right now given you our best estimate which we is with what we an allin number if you is we about impact in the we get further and further into bringing equipment up and actually making they function a intended may change right now we a good number of knockon effect alluded to in my opening remark and is given our revenue grows in the we expect to be about half of what we would normally experience on a seasonal If we run the math on we about another of earnings foregone from a revenue standpoint in the between the foregone earnings of and the actual expected increase in recovery cost of it look out to be about a impact in the Do you have a followon Do you expect any sort of makeup in the half especially on the margin side term of modeling should we assume once you get back to the revenue level you had last your margin be the same or similar well you again Ive talked about for cost much all go through cost of revenue so have a negative impact on our margin to the extent much wrap up the repair cost and the recovery cost we should expect to see our margin begin to move back to the level you grew accustomed seeing u at at those revenue level you Lets move to the next is with your guidance is fairly wide up one to nine wondering if the variable there are simply Japan or is there anything else behind believe is very consistent with what from historically usually start with a at and then try to narrow it a we move into the midquarter update this is consistent with what historically provided at the beginning of the very good can you also clarify a bit more whats happening in distribution channel you sellthrough very strong inventory down yet done a good job to sort of get the inventory back up what exactly is happening there mean are distributor wanting to build more inventory trying to understand it better well sellthrough strong and frankly we had expected it to be strong coming into the Now it certainly part of the characterization we gave back in we thought we were coming into an aboveseasonal you only have to go back to their those distributor report where they were talking about order strength and positive booktobills to away with type of consideration would inventory is about where they would to have it and frankly where we would to have them we mentioned day were down a few basically in the sixweek for their inventory about where they have historically been especially if you make adjustment for the increasing amount of distributor inventory were carrying on consignment program consignment moved up a bit About a of our distribution revenue is now being supported on consignment program a continues to move up and by the way we also a we bring National portfolio onboard we move into consignment program with distribution a well a the percentage of our distribution support is supported by consignment inventory move up then naturally the amount of inventory the distributor need to carry would move down correspondingly but again would theyre generally right in the where they would to be believe two question well move to the next go next to with a on calculator versus your regular semiconductor usually up the Calculator side in the reason Japan or otherwise wouldnt constitute the usual two to three point of sequential growth you it right If you at Calculators from to very typical would be a doubling of their revenue there no reason where we wouldnt expect same could be to point of companylevel revenue growth to coming from seasonal lift in Calculator demand Do you have a followon different topic though OpEx your OpEx went up about mentioned about the investment in Embedded and Is the majority of and should we about sort of magnitude a you continue to invest were there onetime thing in sequential comparison wont occur again a we go the only onetime to point back to we do do our annual pay and benefit increase in the there about of a quarter worth of in there youll see a bit more of a we go into next a we get a fullquarter effect of Plus back to your earlier about calculator and so on from a seasonality standpoint we typically see our SGA go up a bit there on marketing cost youll typically see our OpEx move up in the last if you go take a at it a good way to about how this might play out a well and the only other point would make is we provided annual we do it for SGA but for RD guidance of Now certainly could round up or round down to number but give you also some rough guideline on you and well move to the next next is with any thought on the amount of debt comfortable taking on associated with the National deal we talked about we would issue somewhere between and of debt a part of acquisition and have any more update for you on still a good number to frame for modeling purpose Do you have a followon you talked about lead time clear message there you at pricing dynamic especially in HighVolume and Power any change to pricing over the last or two especially since the quake pricing much across the board is trending normally anything we would is of all abnormal to begin with much le we would correlate to the quake you for your question move to the next next is with you give u an update on the market share you believe you had with OMAP in term of the market share gain you expect over the next few quarter is relative to previous OMAP product is it relative to the competition if so why do you you were getting share in space have a share number for you specifically there lot of thirdparty people make their living at trying to make assessment guess would reference you in direction term of gain were making and what give u confidence we see share gain it a simple a looking at the pipeline of win we have under way to some degree it depends upon how you define the market and mean cute What mean though is our view of mobile computing and the opportunity there is a broad definition of the opportunity it includes tablet and it includes smartphones but it also includes area data terminal in the brown truck deliver the package to you pull a data terminal out and record the delivery and you sign on the pad we view a an OMAP a potential OMAP application fact we have win in space again a very broad definition of the opportunity for mobile computing and by no mean diminish our enthusiasm for OMAP in smartphones and in tablet fact would both of those are mustwin area but we also have a much broader definition where were to be able to take same OMAP technology and put it into a lot of different area eReaders personal navigation device mentioned previously are all area where we have OMAP design win in pipeline referring to these arent demo project somebody did at a trade show These are production program we have in development for customer be into production in so there always uncertainty a to how much success a particular product have out in the marketplace in term of the quality of the customer the size of the potential opportunity we are quite confident it to translate to very solid market share gain for u in market Do you have a followon Quick followup on the production for RFAB any type of guidance in term of production we could expect from RFAB by end of this also how would compare with the peak potential output from same fab what would is the revenue amount coming out of RFAB is still relatively small all along we are capable from an equipment perspective of ramping RFAB up into about a production and we pace based upon market demand Certainly event such a had in Japan have resulted in somewhat of an acceleration there have a number to be able to well be at this dollar value or this percent utilization other than it ramping nicely maybe even ahead of plan based on the added motivation of getting those Miho device qualified over there go next to Ramesh with Advisors Ramesh Advisors for squeezing me in very roughly what your percentage of revenue from Japan longer do you expect to change in other word are you seeing customer in Japan looking to diversify their supplier base from being heavily Japancentric to something a more balanced percent of revenue from Japan last about to the of are we do we believe customer for more diversified supplier base believe so our mean shouldnt believe so What mean is it way too early for customer to be through Theyre focused on bringing their factory back into operation in earthquake zone at this point theyre trying to figure out whether they should be there or whether they should be someplace else can happen and very likely could happen later but havent heard of a customer reevaluating their location status would point out also the output from Miho is not sold into Japan it is sold around the world it there not a direct connection between Miho or Aizu factory and the actual revenue we gain in Japan one Ill mention a a longer benefit for is it always there cost to our customer there distraction to our customer to requalify our product from one fab to another fab a before because of the supply disruption out of Miho there been an intensified effort on behalf of the customer to go ahead and help u internally multisource those product into other fabs something from an operational and logistics perspective well benefit from over Having the same device in production at multiple fabs and having those customer qualification already in place always provides u a different of flexibility Ramesh do you have a followon Ramesh Advisors is helpful quick one your midquarter update you had you felt the had bottomed and begun to rebound Are you still seeing guess broader including the mobile Ramesh in fact is correct what we earlier in the because there had been a chipset recall we had disruption in but a we moved later into a other supplier basically back online and moved we had even at the midquarter update recovery in our PCrelated would did continue through the of is continuing well at this point with well wrap up you for joining a of this call is on our and good Ladies and gentleman this today discussion appreciate your',\n",
       "       'go to with talked a bit about the booking trend in and you a bit about what so far this wont break it down week by week but everything both on the order front a well a shipment or revenue been strong thus far in the nothing thus far would discourage u at all from the outlook provided me add to if can backlog coming into the actually higher than from over the last few year which give further confidence to the outlook were providing realize you were to able to build a bit of inventory in Whats your inventory plan for the on the inventory plan per se but we do expect to continue to build inventory on those part have high demand we want to keep short lead time on clearly the shape of the demand dictate how much inventory we try to position if we go through the keep in mind the other factor even though we have a plan to build inventory depending upon where we land in revenue could impact our inventory expectation or actuals a well go next to with me start by off by asking in term of where booking improvement you called out the book you also talked about LCD TV want to understand whether also from distributor a well if you are able to of walk through by end market however you can give u a of where booking are coming from guess would it is reasonably broadbased now Again the overall trend down we specifically called out what we were seeing in PCs and some of the HDTV space because those were area in prior call we had noted there inventory correction underway in those area were particularly weak To hit on distribution in the remark our distribution resale were down about noted we were able to help distributor build a few day of inventory would their inventory level are at very comfortable level from an absolute standpoint Theyre over six week of inventory currently if you at historical level them generally in the eight to nine week Now you need to adjust for about of our distribution revenue we now support with consignment even with adjustment certainly inventory are at very call normal or typical level compared to history and at a comfortable based on what the distributor are expecting in term of their future resale demand ask you about OMAP talked about a prospect for OMAP but one wouldnt help but notice your OMAP designed out from one of your large customer want to of get a of how we should be confident about the prospect of OMAP especially a you see more and more competition there get more tablet based Are there any comment you can make there also type to clarify your stance on the tablet market with OMAP Did you mention a competitor in the tablet space right indiscernible get very aggressive heard comment about how much share of gain within the tablet market been the one product one of shipping now is tablet we want to see now what make you comfortable about OMAP prospect in the light of all the competition resting in the system What make u comfortable are the design program we have underway and design program are specifically slated to go into production me these are not longterm development program These are program are to result in relatively nearterm revenue competitor you referred to NVIDIA to their credit the out with a dual core application processor believe they had a of month maybe a lead on our OMAP product OMAP began sampling a had product in customer hand for over a at this point well along in development program again them being for customer are trying to get out with tablet program right away especially some are based upon the Android operating system theyre the player they were the player out so there is a natural alignment there guess what would is we fully are comfortable we be there a these program hit stride and ramp into real volume mentioned in my remark we are in volume production now with OMAP were not in production to put those product in inventory fact were shipping to a customer plan to ramp their tablet production based on OMAP again acknowledged for a long the tablet market a is the smartphone market be a competitive market to find translates to great opportunity for across a variety of product area go next to with this is a bit unusual from the standpoint of your competitor are saying different thing about their own lead time Some theyre all the way back down to normal consistent with what saying Others are suggesting their own lead time are still elevated Do you have any you can give u for sort of industry average with the combination of some competitor still being extended and others still being all the way back down agree completely with what describing actually different competitor are at different point even last week listening to a call where a competitor a very credible competitor talking about their lead time have progressed but they still remain extended well take more the best can about our own situation is believe we on top of the situation earlier in term of capacity investment and we brought capacity online what translated to lead reduction for u you can always have demand fix your lead time If it turn down enough if anything for u this respite in demand had over the last of quarter allowed u to get the capacity investment we have been making get it online get some inventory in place and get our lead time back to normal the other to be important is depending upon what happens with growth in our industry in we feel completely comfortable with the headroom we have on our capacity now allow u to grow quite aggressively if what the market want to do at the same maintain our lead time where we and our customer want them to be youll find if we get into some heady growth in a lot of our competitor have not made capacity investment and maybe lead time have adjusted maybe more recently because of slower demand environment over the last suspect youll find them in a different situation with their lead trend in of environment If could ask specifically about how you feel your position within power management in the tablet space another one of your competitor have referenced the fact they lost the socket the power management socket in the tablet and everybodys trying to figure out who potentially gained socket and wondered how well positioned you you are in space Theres a broad and there an implied me answer the broad which is we are very well positioned in the tablet with our power management you well were wellpositioned overall in the marketplace with power management but certainly tablet are a targeted area for u across a number of product line because a new emerging space with a lot of opportunity fact maybe can even diverge for a and about opportunity overall Ill stay away from the implied which were we the player picked up their lost socket were wellpositioned and we there a lot of opportunity me maybe of walk through a bit our view of the tablet opportunity for there a lot of dialogue amongst analyst and investor on how big is opportunity and how it compare to a u we believe there over of content opportunity in a tablet go across OMAP and wireless connectivity of the break out of is the content alone is over OMAP content the apps processor opportunity is in the and then there an additional to of content opportunity for connectivity By no mean do we have all of in each system some case we are playing on and maybe not on OMAP certainly the opportunity If compare opportunity to a for the biggest difference is in a the processor a well a most of the connectivity value is dominated by a single player not an opportunity for Of course unlike a tablet a includes a hard disk drive where we would have to of content per system on average the net difference between opportunity and a tablet represents a very significant opportunity for breadth of our portfolio across OMAP and connectivity Ill give u a tremendous opportunity to carve out what could be a very very significant piece of this important emerging market and we plan to make the most of it go next to with the margin can you give u a flavor of the moving part to go into and a it relates to your and more particularly your utilization rate Do you expect them to decline again in in the already mentioned we felt the full effect of bringing three new factory online clearly had an impact on u utilization in the actually down quite a few point wasnt all attributable to the new factory consciously slowed down production in our remaining factory with the exception of those product where we had extended lead time continue to build inventory on those product alone in order to get lead time back to normal while we bring it on the new factory and define overall utilization the weight in our margin in the Going in the we expect utilization maybe up another point or two not significantly but up a bit and be a function of both how demand shape up in the and more importantly how our outlook begin to shape up for and beyond so we can have inventory ready on to maintain the achievement had on bringing lead time in to ask and clarify so the new factory were being already accounted for in the for the most part all the asset we had previously acquired from Qimonda Spansion and the China fab all in Theres not another chunk to along in the correct Theres not another chunk to along it is all in fact one of the best way you could see is on our cash flow statement and at the depreciation line see a step up from the to the If you multiply time four it consistent with our depreciation we have for already at the depreciation run rate on lead time are there any other area where your product lead time are still the tightest or are actually out in you mentioned your end market were good Are there any end market are still soft or you expect the weakest sequential growth in lead time the overwhelming majority of product are back to a normal lead are still some exception but there always is in a normal industry cycle anyway are some part where wed prefer to have shorter lead time and some customer would prefer also but now the minority of part a opposed to the majority Most of is fine expect now gotten lead time largely caught up well continue to use a relatively seasonal down in the to make much more attractive lead time in the event becomes a stronger a talking about earlier so we can maintain what in there go next to with you mentioned the inventory correction look to be over in certain part but maybe not over in other part you about the various end market and what stage you see them being at visavis any sort of inventory issue guess maybe throw in your expectation for the end market this and the rest of the me take a stab at it and may have a few comment to make not to be able to walk through market by market what we have tried to do is identify in the few area we specifically have previously noted the inventory correction the most significant tried to provide some guidance or perspective we inventory correction is largely complete If you go more broadly there are some customer are totally clean are other customer would not be in similar situation or still have more to go in term of cleaning up inventory now it vary customer by customer maybe somewhat market by market but more customer by customer were to do u a lot of benefit to walk through each of those other than what you may gain from listening and talking to those customer directly a they report their own result right to reemphasize on what opened with though the space we saw at least for our battery management product bottomed in the beginning of the and grew steadily through the balance of the TV space seemed to have bottomed out in the indication from our customer their inventory are largely cleared and we can expect resumption of order in the talked about communication infrastructure continuing to be solid in the automotive being recently solid Smartphones are actually quite strong and with the adoption rate consumer around the world one would expect would be continue to be quite strong into then the industrial space we had talked about day industrial had been enjoying quite a few quarter of very strong growth led by inventory replenishment a well a in demand growth and then we expected growth rate slow down in the and in fact it did slowed down to in demand of growth and we expect to be the norm in your Embedded and other business all grew roughly the same within a few point of each other you give u your of relative to your overall revenue growth where you would expect those three product region to grow Ill you our objective we talked about is growing those core area in their respective market in fact we did this Theyve done enough in a of year if you take a at them total grew at and the core area grew at plus a over for the nonbaseband wireless about for Embedded processing and for clearly very strong growth rate and a lot of momentum given the scale of sale force and the scale of the portfolio plus more recently the scale of our manufacturing capability ability to outgrow our competitor certainly seems to be more highly probable than you might have thought a of year especially in light of the observation made earlier is we did take action in late and especially to increase our manufacturing capacity which allowed u to begin bringing our lead time in many case before quite a few of our competitor could Many of our competitor would not necessarily take similar action and should we have a resumption of growth a we go into and beyond it could be difficult for some of them to respond to customer demand which increase the probability again we outgrow our marketplace in a well aware but a a reminder for broader audience there is Baseband revenue decline over the next of year of our revenue both a well a for the found it interesting even though it didnt contribute to growth at an absolute it held those dollar Baseband dollar held relatively stable from to Yet a a percentage of revenue it continues to decline it continues to would it a be le important to u and le impactful to u continue to wind down and certainly not provide the growth contribution the core area to give you a sort of a refresh on the number the baseband revenue is over this point if you compare to a what is both a the non market not shown a lot of growth and to some degree a our customer brought on alternative supplier in the non technology is now a minimal part of our revenue base Sometime this theyll have a supplier for on Baseband you can expect at then incursion or degradation in revenue for stay in tune what their alternative supplier and what customer say a to the timing of when be not right now is what would go next to with or maybe a clarification from an earlier but in a circumstance where were of an average growth call it a to for the industry do you feel the capacity added is to be a competitive advantage another way of asking the same is do you of the industry absent your capacity is to be relatively tight and by adding capacity the way you have you can therefore take market share sort of in an average growth curve if we of take a again at the capacity of the industry well aware with the onset of the downturn after the of something in the order of of capacity taken offline and much permanently offline Since then there been some capacity added but the last report saw suggested total industry capacity and not including memory in statement is somewhere around of where it in the of would were still under capacitized given demand if you because the total market is now back above where it in even if you have an average of growth rate describing it would certainly seem the market is to be very stressed on capacity into and competitor who have not thought ahead to put capacity in place and they find rather difficult to deal with What we find particularly attractive again is the capacity we have brought online been at price point cost point we simply have not in the if it turn out to be a slow growth it not to have much impact financially on a negative standpoint If it turn out to be or strong growth we should be able to convert into very profitable revenue at a rate beyond what our competitor can manage Ill also note rhetorically when the last our industry growth at an average growth rate Usually it very aggressive or in decline you a well a any of u about OMAP which is a dual core solution you about your plan if you have any for a quad core solution and a part of can you address whether or not you even a relevant architecture to have in today market if you at the one call it the nextgeneration core we specifically announced were using it for OMAP then again maybe we did licensed in fact we were the initial licensee from ARM for their Eagle Core necessarily we go a key player in additional parallel course a maybe moved to higher performance direction such a Eagle guess we always have flexibility go next to Steve with not if you discussed it but can you about if your mix of between highvolume power and highperformance remain roughly the same percentage wise a you sort of discussed in the Steve it actually we looked at how landed overall versus you might recall in described breakout HVAL and then each High Performance and Power the good news is and frankly what we had tried to set a expectation we thought we were at a point where we would have HVAL contributing at about the same pace a those others make an impact happens and the mix did not change compared to again further reinforcement of a lot of the work we have done to have HVAL become a major contributor to our growth in fact followed through to reality regard to HVAL a you mentioned you put a lot of work into you have a number of win taken some technology transferred to other area Does suggest a we go through HVAL now perhaps outgrow the other category we would expect it to outgrow the other category our expectation and this is not a statement it a longerterm statement our expectation is the opportunity and our growth should be well balanced across power HPA and HVAL a a to be at this point go next to with Kind of a followed on from earlier rather than by end market if you talked about your better than seasonal guide by the four product segment you have are there any big outlier in whats being better than seasonal worse than seasonal or right at seasonal there anything to point at of it is we had a slightly below seasonal and so down look the other way when you go into again beyond what we had dragging on u and consumer space and with the TV space in the we indicated we now are seeing begin to pick back up and indication from our TV customer is the TV people we supply is we would expect to see a resumption of order in the Beyond there not any one place would additional color to a you understand we try not to take our forecast or outlook and break it down by individual segment or product line we serve u well to stay with approach TV and together what represents a a percentage of sale Then the real follow up on OpEx it dropped nicely in the you give fullyear guidance to RD but what are the put and take for OpEx in the specifically the OpEx down in the and fairly typical where we see people taking more vacation and so on youll tend to see OpEx decline which it did nicely would expect in the OpEx to increase good is to back at last Last year our OpEx up around quarteroverquarter and a direct effect of the increase we typically put into place in the a well a far fewer vacation day in the again wed expect to see a similar up on a quartertoquarter to what we saw a addition to you might note did give RD guidance a being up a bit from what we spent this and start immediately in the would expect it to be up OpEx in the at a faster growth rate than what we saw in the yearago again on the function of paying benefit increase fewer vacation day and stepped up spending on RD your it a mix of revenue is TV and PCs to get a bonus answer and to breakout our revenue overall by market is for a a whole Communications of revenue and down a few point from Ill also note the biggest piece of communication is communication infrastructure Computer of revenue down a point from me break out because it go across several different area PCs actually is about what we sell directly into manufacturer Beyond we also have sell into storage manufacturer both in term of hard disk drive a well a optical about of revenue Servers is Monitors are of a DLP front projector revenue then printer are then continuing at the industrial is of revenue or last up a few point from Consumer and unchanged from of is the TV number but have a breakout for television Automotive last up a of point from then education which is our calculator product in down one point from go next to with Capital Capital from the and a you at the calendar guidance could you give u any feel for the contribution from the revenue associated with the factory service deal you have in China or in Japan separately rather in the vein of on the OpEx side in seeing a somewhat lower margin in the calendar could you give u some feel for what some of the put and take might be in what appears to be a slightly lower margin for the on the revenue from the Transition Services Agreement focused in the and still hold forecast we expect those revenue to be le than of our overall revenue we wont break it down any more than or by quarter anymore than would put a bit more color on you with the Chengdu fab a we disclosed transition service agreement run for three or four quarter before it wind down with the Spansion fab transition service agreement run for up to two year and winding down during the course of overall revenue is expected to be le than of our revenue Capital Is the contribution fairly similar in the and the is helping to some extent with the slightly better than seasonal guidance be fairly similar quarteroverquarter versus the all in for all three of those factory specifically those who are doing the transition service agreement on should be offset your on OpEx Capital More on margin put and take a we begin the indicated you felt maybe margin might be a different in the would you we do expect utilization to be up a bit in the not quite how putting into your model but do make the OpEx properly accounted for on into is it up a should be up more than this because were stepping up our RD Also forget should stock dividend equivalent adjustment we have to make on our earnings per share need to make a similar adjustment when you do your model so you get back to what you is the target GPM percent of course go next to with order down this revenue guidance down about Is mismatch strictly because of the order linearity in the can you give me some feeling guess if or is it a bit more normal might those two number order and revenue guidance been more closely matched What we see in there is a lead time came in a they started coming in the we already began to see our book to bill fall below one which is quite normal customer who may have been putting six month backlog on u a we began to move the lead in didnt have to give u backlog order a far out in Frankly they could go for a few week or even a of month without putting new order on and still have the backlog coverage they want we saw sort of phenomenon on in the and it quite normal and quite expected other we did see give again reassurance a to the outlook we provided for the is we had a backlog coverage into frankly higher than for a number of year consistent with what been talking about the market the major market of and TVs we talked about much cleared their inventory in the and were beginning to see of a normal order pattern beginning to show up a we came into late and currently a we move further into the a well would add maybe two other thing Again it not new but reiterating what we view of the correction and adjustment to customer inventory and where they are in progress is part of the reason Another reason is maybe the last reason would be what to date in term of strength both in term of order and revenue play into confidence a well Regarding the RD guidance can you give u some feeling for where investing the incremental spend in term of the type of project or area to be across the core area of Embedded Processing and the nonbaseband portion of wireless would given the size get most of those dollar then youll get a distribution of into the Embedded Processing next and the remainder the growth go into the nonbaseband portion of wireless it all in the core product area is not in other area take our final from with a followup to an earlier on the which is baseband how do we we should model sound no incremental supplier to your big customer until midyear so flattish half and then a decline should we about heard u before if you straight line from where we are down to zero in the the only we can tell you is thatll be wrong Youll have some quarter above youll have some quarter below qualitatively Ive tried to describe most of revenue is and until they have a player ready to start supplying revenue well wont it stable but it move with our customer own level of given up forecasting when theyre to have a alternative supplier on board to shift risk to you a the analyst now you at least our mix of to be able to base on If you over the last decade you have always done a good job growing RD slower than you grow revenue and not to him to easily back into a revenue guidance for the but when you at the RD guidance up over for the is there something unusual about this is a structurally high investment when we about the core x Baseband is leverage you have been able to show in the still applicable what your revenue assumption is but it sound pessimistic RD up Is there anything you see in the RD for this specifically which would drive RD growth faster than revenue growth Overall you we wrap up you for joining u of this call is on our and good again today call do appreciate everyones',\n",
       "       'come from of to clarify you continue to expect the lead time to normalize by the end of this lead time did in in the and we expect them to continue to in in if all go well then a we enter next we should have lead time back to normal then a my followup it seems the and the consumer end market are below normal Is everything else roughly normal is anything above normal would is this a guess what would is right Those are the area would be below of the normal run rate Probably the one area would continues to be strong is comms infrastructure Handsets since we only have one customer there want to provide any commentary Industrial would the best description there is it normalizing transitioning from which is an extension of the three quarter this where it been growing rapidly due to cyclical recovery would would represent more normalizing to a more typical seasonal pattern from industrial you did identify the two area we would call out a being weaker Those being computing and part of the consumer market next come from of or it doesnt feel this cycle is a dramatic a maybe other cycle in the least my perception wonder one if you agree with when do you inventory issue might be over and what are the clue you have suggest to you if in fact what you see your perception is shared by u is the adjustment were seeing underway are starting now is more focused and not broadbased and is generally mild If you in the when you at booktobills typically if we get to four five six quarter of positive booktobills and followed by a of quarter of negative or near one booktobills would typically suggest maybe a of quarter from an adjustment phase before we have a resumption of demand the and consumer space a discussed here we saw demand soften up in so were halfway through our on so if we take a out it would be from our view reasonable to assume we get through this adjustment process over the next or two and then we see a resumption of overall end market demand Theres a press release a while about ZTE spending a bit of money are named a one of the people with whom theyd be spending wondered if you could shed any light on particular announcement and help u to understand whether or not this is something new with these with ZTE and if there are any material element of the contract we should about guess have a lot to refer you to ZTE in term of anything they may want to offer had a strong presence in China overall and had a relationship specifically with ZTE for many year this is an extension of a lot of good thing had been happening for for some and our growing momentum in market which is one we see is to be especially important for in the year to beyond have anything to about one specifically next come from of ramping capacity putting in place implies a lot of market share gain over the next of year Whats your pricing outlook for with regard to strategy and also in lieu of the current weakness were seeing in some end market at the low end the capacity were adding necessarily any bearing on our pricing outlook per se capacity you may recall we began over a with the acquisition of equipment from Qimonda who in bankruptcy at the to begin to put millimeter equipment into our fab our Richardson fab went through a phase on with another location they had in Dresden where we purchased equipment to complete Phase II in RFAB addition last we announced acquiring Spansion of Japan out of bankruptcy this we announced our manufacturing acquisition for manufacturing plant in China To put in perspective where were at in those acquisition right now the RFAB qualified it product this and we do expect to ship our revenuegenerating wafer out of factory this ramp up consistent with demand Spansion is concerned the one we acquired in Japan we expect to have our wafer out of factory by the end of this a we ported one of our process into factory with the Chengdu factory in China in fact we had already been using factory a a foundry for some of our HVAL product and we be porting additional product into factory over the next of quarter we would expect those factory to ramp up fairly slowly on our product consistent with whatever we see in demand the meantime those two factory the one in Japan and the one in China in both case we have transitional service agreement with the seller whereby we are selling them some product out of those factory to a large extent offset our operating cost a we bring up our own process technology in those factory guess the only would add is if you about what mean even with RFAB or were moving into production this a of now we have one product qualified and moving into production if you about the timing of a well a the other two factory and you compare to what previously about this of market weakness our view is to be relatively shortlived and mild Those factory ramping are coming on more online on the other side of this of weakness a opposed to a lot of market weakness is underway do you expect resale to track in versus sale you mentioned your inventory in the channel were at normal level Was it fair to assume you expect any type of adjustment for this coming guess a Ill stick with our normal practice which is we try to forecast resale in the out mean the best can do is point out if you in the prior the resale generally tracked very closely with own revenue trend but have a projection for you on resale in next come from of thinking about millimeter here and where we are on this in the whole cycle thing moderating a bit Industrial seems it peaked out Am taking it correctly in saying it not necessarily slowing down it not to grow a fast a we have over the last several quarter or so you have it right is slowing down but the comparison is to a cyclical recovery so it moving more to seasonal pattern not expected to go through a at this point we see a correction per se see it moving to a more normalized seasonal pattern if thing returning to normal bringing up millimeter it sound pricing remains firm had a nice ramp of margin improvement here shouldnt we expect through next margin continue to improve a your cost base drive down doesnt sound were in a downward cycle with demand and yet your cost have to be starting to drop especially if you bring up this new fabs cost operating cost in term of the agreement gained with the people buying them from clearly bringing on these factory at these of cost profile certainly is a favorable outlook for our overall margin Importantly a and Embedded Processing become a bigger portion of our overall portfolio also give u more tailwind on our margin the fact of the matter is were not focusing on trying to improve our margin so much a we are focusing a lot more on trying to improve our top line growth heard u talking for a number of quarter now about having a growth objective whereby we are considerably outgrowing our market and gaining market share from our customer where all our energy and focus is at doesnt mean we not margin fall through a they produce themselves but not what were aiming at and not the purpose of the acquisition of those factory purpose of the acquisition of those factory is to support the top line growth happily those factory came to u at very inexpensive cost a a clarification then If it come down between not getting the top line growth after and your margin are at record level we would be reasonable to assume the margin be capped and maybe a more aggressive pricing profile so you can build the top line make any assumption we set the price market set the price and we cant anticipate how competitor respond to customer demand What were focused on is making we have adequate capacity to grow a rapidly a we can a our customer accept our product to infer would lead u to a pricing decision would be an incorrect conclusion because frankly price are set competitively not unilaterally in our space a heard u for some but for the broader audience especially in pricing is determined more based on the quality of the product the specification of the product the performance level of the product and you have to be competitive on pricing not how you win win based upon the quality and performance level of the product so even in a weaker market environment or if growth is not producing the level we expect you change fundamental dynamic by changing your price Changing price or lowering price below market leaf the money on the table not result in incremental revenue for the majority of our product line Theres a small part of our product line represents le than of our revenue would be considered commodity type product is priceelastic but again a net relative to the broader product portfolio our next come from Ramesh from Advisors Ramesh CE Unterberg Towbin is in regard to your capital spending been very opportunistic over the last to month but it sound still looking for opportunity here if you found inexpensive fab youd still be expanding capacity at what point would stop Ramesh what have indicated to in my opening remark we believe we have acquired enough capacity to meet our intermediateterm growth objective were satisfied with what so far Now not to if we continue to find some of those factory at price point frankly are unheard of in our in this industry we may not consider them for acquisition our focus now is on bringing these factory up we have and bringing price up in the production getting ready for what we believe be a resumption of growth in the industry in the next of quarter saying in general we for investment opportunity make for our could be smaller acquisition or could be the capital equipment u the former would be the priority Ramesh CE Unterberg Towbin your Other did you see weakness in the consumeroriented part of it a well such a calculator other word your strength in the Other driven predominantly by your custom ASICs wasnt want to predominantly actually saw calculator increase from the to but seasonal Backtoschool usually peak in the for u and typically increase somewhat beyond biggest area of sequential strength in Other in custom ASIC would the of area of is we do have a significant part of our custom ASIC go in the communication infrastructure both wireless PlayStations a well a the enterprise side and both increased in the then we also sell custom ASIC product is of more one off but for touchscreen controller into smartphones also did nicely for u in the a bit of insight into the custom ASIC other area we mentioned DLP DLP is still being dominated in term of revenue base by front projector and it continues to be a nice and it even have shown some recent growth for u so no real change on front though our next come from from can ask you within the Edge file you talked about weakness in computing and consumer product stabilizing now in term of booking strength within also can you about whether you have any position in the tablet market and what mean for if you at HVAL you are right Theres there the computing tie is more through product go into hard disk drive Power Product line in also sell into PCs some of the Power product but HVAL is more through hard disk drive and storage product your description of well Ill we expect it continue to be what before demand continue of the current trend we saw in the of slowing into the a well HVAL also sell into a of other product such a smartphones Some of the Power area in smartphones they sell into some video gaming on the consumer side even though consumer television are weak there were other area such a video gaming on the consumer side and actually did reasonably well for u in the trying to if there are other area of notable to mention Those are the one would tie maybe a final one would be infrastructure sell into some of communication and wireless infrastructure a well and of course almost anything touching infrastructure for u would be guess on both the HVAL side but then also some of the HPA product tie into comms infrastructure a well a anything we have selling into infrastructure whether it the ASIC product Ive mentioned the Embedded Processing product or some of these product have done well we would expect to continue doing well into the talked about tablet some strength in tablet market my here is how impact across the board one would obviously expects gain for the OMAP but would to get a of your focus there and your positioning in some of the upcoming tablet then how cut across other segment of your through we talked about HDD tablet are to cannibalize the What would be impact of on do you have a commensurate gain also on tablet offset in the weakness there any comment you can make a what it mean for across with your OMAP would we saw a lot of guess would describe it a principally various product for example Power Products go into tablet saw strength in those area a you might guess in the strength not even though it a nice growing and offset some of the weakness we saw along on the front or the notebook front it wasnt the exposure these day because of the relative size of market of course higher for u see how change over those tend to be some of the more those type of product tend to be a le visible guess you might see all the various tear down and they try to describe who this processor or processor Products Power tend to run under the radar of other area would mention the audio amplifier some of the connectivity product certainly there opportunity in tablet then a previously mentioned clearly OMAP a the main processor to handle some of both the application the graphic et cetera certainly is a great opportunity the opportunity go well beyond OMAP and were already benefiting even in from the growth of tablet and we expect to broaden a product OMAP transition into production in space next come from of Capital the factory is what spending for the factory in China and Japan part of your capital expenditure budget then can you add some color on you you were getting some revenue from some of these factory agreement you quantify how much contributing into the factory some portion of those acquisition are in capital and some portion of those acquisition are being accounted for a an acquisition of the fact you could see on the cash flow statement with our earnings release example on the Japan acquisition we used net of about acquiring all of those asset and about of is for an acquisition of the in the balance acquisition go through CapEx the acquisition in Chengdu we initially used about in acquired net asset most of through the acquisition of the remaining or so be earned out on the acquisition over the course of next it a bit of a mix Some of it through CapEx and some of it is acquisition of a far a the revenue we expect we anticipate the revenue we get through those transition service agreement be le than of revenue by and large what wind up doing is absorbing the cost of those factory during the we are bringing up our own process technology and tie those factory transitionally guess the other way we tend to at this yes there be a bit of benefit a we have some of revenue in we did not have in at the same Ill you we also are selling our cable modem and we expect transaction to close in for the most part what we lose in transitionally on cable modem be about the same amount we gain through some of these transitional supply agreement on margin and utilization rate can you give u guess your view on the put and take for margin into and maybe into the half also can you share with u what your utilization rate trend were in term of are they higher in lower in your expectation for we havent publicized our utilization rate in a while but would leave it to it they were relatively flat for the last of quarter and with the increasing capacity coming online and our expectation of decline in revenue into the we expect our utilization to drop a bit but there to be any material impact especially given the cost of the capacity we brought online give a GPM forecast give a revenue and earnings per share forecast Ill leave it at for now next come from of USA on the distributor growing inventory a bit wondering given demand is weakening on the margin and also heading into a seasonally weaker why would the distributor be building inventory Is it because there is some pocket of strength is it because some region needed more inventory if you describe then it because they needed more inventory in certain product line and certain area mean keep in mind lead time have been extended and supply been constrained for some even though made progress lead time are still a pointed out earlier extended beyond where we want them a of right now so a thing have loosened up a bit we and the distributor took advantage of in the to put in place some inventory they had been trying to get in place for some USA on the margin wondering about a we head into the half which is seasonally somewhat softer besides the utilization coming down maybe a bit should we expect any incremental depreciation from some of the new acquisition there be some incremental depreciation in fact with the qualification of RFAB this we expect to see depreciation up a bit in the would you also there a natural rolloff go on while depreciation may be up for a of quarter expect it back down a we move into next fact if you of step back and take a at the broader picture you may recall we depreciate on a fiveyear straightline If you go back to and at our capital expenditure back then it about if recall beginning to roll off and roll off over the next of quarter CapEx forecast for this is mentioned earlier some of those acquisition are through acquisition of the if you add it all together and were talking about or so of asset were acquiring this be depreciated to a large extent whats rolling off be replaced with the acquisition made in and plan to make here in so yearoveryear we expect our depreciation to change all much be able to give a more precise outlook on after we close the for some early planning and for trying to figure out what depreciation might do for GPM may help frame for you a bit guess would add on the fixed cost are relatively stable what about some of the variable cost then associated with the new factory were bringing on variable cost of RFAB scale with revenue clearly staffing and material cost and so on are highly variable and be brought on only a revenue pull demand through factory then the variable cost associated again with the acquisition in Japan and China by and large are being offset by the Transition Services Agreement a we bring up our new process there we expect a fairly smooth transition unless those Transition Services Agreement begin to shift downward and cost is left behind should happen about the same were bringing up our own production those factory and we can absorb into the revenuegenerating wafer next come from from quickly on the Wireless so you had all piece up but we had OMAP application process a they were up definitely le than connectivity actually found a bit surprising wondering if you could a bit about what you is driving guess the larger offset seeing particularly in connectivity in term of end market or product if you could comment a bit on how you see market share in application processor particularly a market is growing very strong when you have competitor Qualcomm and some of the other are also making their push in there a well guess would whats driving growth in connectivity are a series of design win accomplished over the last several year believe we have the most integrated connectivity solution out there centered up on our WiFi solution even if you at where connectivity been over the last few year and where it clearly there a trend towards integration and a lot of the player of were a single technology player have the capability to integrate and do it a quickly a where we played across historically WiFi Bluetooth GPS FM radio so it quite natural for u to have the capability to roll all altogether into an integrated solution the trend toward integration in the connectivity market positioned favorably worked to benefit won a lot of design a a result and seeing in term of revenue growth Now before you take and extrapolate it too far a in the remark also had tremendous success in designing in OMAP and OMAP product generation a well so youll see even though for the last few quarter connectivity been the fastest growing could rapidly change and go through a of where OMAP is growing fast youll see both of those area grow but it of happen in fit and start based on a new generation of product roll out and a design win move into production part of my also on application process a if you could address my followup would be one more in margin briefly to see if you could give me any color on for next Do you anticipate any sort of impact either the positive or the negative from the millimeter you start to ramp back to volume is there sort of any measurable impact on the margin front from the foundry arrangement from Spansion and from Chengdu we hit the apps processor in the discussion so well to move on and answer the margin the short answer is no on the impact from GPM did mention earlier we see depreciation go up a bit in because we have now qualified most of the equipment in RFAB clearly be there it actually move the needle much from an overall GPM standpoint next come from of Capital Capital on ROIC do give out the number every back looking historically you have been a high and now bumping up against other only slightly more profitable than you Is there a target managing the to the return on invested capital right it high this about by my math there wouldnt there is a model per se other than were mindful of the fact profitable enterprise have to return on their capital in excess of what their of cost of capital is clearly a long a were above we believe were adding value to our shareholder and clearly we are well above right now of the thing high ROIC do for u is it allows u to generate healthy level of cash a here certainly for an extended of cash in excess of what we need to actually grow and operate our on a daytoday and quartertoquarter which allows u to be aggressive on buying back share and also over returning cash to shareholder in the form of dividend a well Capital a quick followup and actually maybe could answer it a well What is the normal seasonality for the OMAP and the Connectivity for given the design win momentum you have is not relevant in the coming Ambris would agree with the latter in general what were seeing there are secular trend go well beyond any of normal seasonality might apply in the wireless market guess would agree with your conclusion there doesnt matter next come from of wondered if you could a bit about the strategy on adding the new capacity there obviously been a lot of from some of the analyst side some of your competitor about where the low hanging fruit is for you What do we see a we go through the next in term of where you would expect sort of the most growth a a result from this new capacity the capacity were putting in place is aimed directly at our portfolio If you take a from a millimeter standpoint clearly the higher volume especially those part are developed in our HVAL a well a some of our higher volume Power part and certain other part would be prime candidate to go to factory also mentioned earlier the factory in Chengdu China already manufacturing some part for u for our HVAL and well continue to do a we port our process in there we expect to put our Power MOSFET into factory a we go into then a it relates to our factory in Japan the process reporting there be initially ideal to suit the HighPerformance portfolio each of those factory be able to support all three element of our again theyre aimed at the portfolio we into with the fab capacity brought online well be continuing to pay attention to our assembly and test capacity and make we keep ahead of the output from those wafer fabs the only else would add or even respond to this reading various sellside note from visit to various competitor it seems the common denominator is these competitor feel millimeter is directed at somebody besides them what would is millimeter is to go across the board in mean HVAL it mean Power and it mean HighPerformance we wont delve off too deeply here millimeter we have a lot more flexibility given the automation system in factory to take a millimeter lot of wafer and subdivide it down into two wafer of product and four wafer of product lot not have to all be at the same product therefore the argument somehow millimeter scale doesnt apply to certain area such a HighPerformance make no to u youll see u move accordingly guess you had stopped breaking out Baseband within the Wireless If you could give u a bit more color however on sort of where we are in the transition away from the Baseband relative to of what talked to u in the we actually do break it out gave it in my remark in the grew look about and it down from a again nothing changed what described before is if you basically straightline it from here to zero by the end of youll have quarter some quarter are above line some quarter are below line so it no different in term of guidance from u be a bit noisy but about the best we could recommend change in term of when we expect revenue basically to be essentially to zero by the we go into the next come from of commented the fact you thought this to be sort of a shallow problem here in term of demand and what gave you confidence to be the case and why based on the order seeing or some customer feedback be helpful a lot of time in the what are typically described a inventory correction in the summer aftermarkets it brought on by usually an excess of inventory in the channel or more often an excess of capacity driving excess of material in fact we appear to see the opposite of our channel inventory remains fairly lean at least from indication from our product we can get from permission from our customer for our product broadly speaking it look for u for the whole industry Ive numerous report indicate total installed capacity for wafer fabs from start standpoint globally is still down significantly from it high point in Most recent stats Ive suggest it still running around below where it back then we have excess capacity driving excess production Generally speaking we do not see much evidence of any excess component of ours up in the channel What we do seem to be seeing is after the sweet cyclical snapback last at many of these channel were seeing growth rate now are beginning to mirror much more to whats happening in the global economy from overall demand from standpoint and from the history of these kind of adjustment Wed expect a of quarter of relatively mild adjustment and a resumption of growth not making a prediction a to what growth look when it resume but we expect it be a resumption of growth after a few quarter of pause guess to add to if we talked about order trend mean our order and of course in were a step down from what we saw in the but we also didnt see order spiral down a we move to the monthbymonth They actually stepped down in and held up relatively stable through August and another data point guess you might is whats driving those comment from u on the Connectivity how committed you are to you have some significant customer concentration and done well in term of the portfolio and ahead of many or your peer but looking out longer not to tell u to shut it down or sell it tomorrow but how committed you are in term of RD investment given not in the Baseband market Ill go ahead and answer for you the RD investment is good intro to an answer on Over the last we have much removed all of our investment in the Baseband a we talked about multiple quarter now and directed over to the nonbaseband portion of our Wireless portfolio which is both connectivity a well a the apps processor Included the apps processor is getting a large share of RD investment would add connectivity is also a were finding different market for those product to be sold into but clearly the lion share of the RD is into the apps processor space is a space is ripe for growth not only in cellphone but in tablet and other application a well such a personal navigation device infotainment system onboard in car a number of different space where those product can be used guess the only other would is there all these ongoing relentless debate about integrated solution with Baseband and Connectivity product of Baseband and application processor if you at it our Connectivity and OMAP revenue is up over yeartodate so it a great growth business and up while mean it clear were getting out of the were pulling back on Baseband and exiting marketplace again data and evidence increasingly prof can be a very good growth for even without being in the Baseband well keep riding one hard it next come from of of all it look your Embedded Processor saw a nice increase in it operating margin and wondering what came from in it grew but it a steep increase in operating margin wondering where came from getting leverage from the revenue growth you saw there overall operating expenditure we increased those might recall back in we moved quite a few resource from our Other into the EP into the Embedded Processing which temporarily depressed operating margin there now a were seeing the revenue growing very strongly there were simply getting a great deal of leverage off of followup is on CapEx CapEx hit more than of revenue the in a long while mean let take out of the equation here but it above wondering are we getting to peak there Are we to start to see a trend back down to sort of the to here our goal remains to be in the to a indicated should be what youll see u doing over wont artificially to prevent u from after very attractive opportunity such a u move on here recently in fact for purpose of modeling you should continue to expect u to operate at to and consider what occurred here recently a an opportunistic aberration clearly heard u quantify how much revenue we can generate off of the capacity we purchased multiple year of capacity need if anything you could even see u moving to the lower end of in the near well take our next from of understand your comment about the inventory you didnt want to make a comment on how about tax and zone inventory for the Would you expect it to be flat up or down we grew inventory in dollar term in and yet our day dropped about another day on u in fact we would to continue to try to grow some especially in those area where we have lead time are beyond what our customer expect of u we continue to operate the factory focus on those area where were still short on overall capacity given the fact we would expect revenue in the below in should have some impact on our day of for a long a we go in the buyback you announced terrific a you talked about a of the market cap a the authorization cash flow generation is terrific but even you have much cash in the balance sheet Would you ever be willing to about taking on some leverage in order to fulfill buyback should we about the buyback coming in a the cash flow growth continues it the latter should at u using our operating cash flow for purpose of buyback have no intention of doing accelerated buyback general you for joining u of this call is on our this today call you for your and have a wonderful day',\n",
       "       'you instruction come from of you guess if you could comment on the booking in the and you talked about in the press release up look it’s slower than the growth we’ve in the of quarter it sound the booktobill actually a bit stronger than what you If you can give some color about what you’ve there What we saw booking actually broadly crossed all of our product and market and across all the region actually the order are coming in more consistently with underlying demand may recall last our booktobill and this at believe what we’re seeing here is the effect of u in orderly fashion beginning to pull our lead time in we’ve given our customer more confidence don’t have to place order on those inaudible a far out in the future a they have for the last three quarter and in addition the underlying demand is on is increasing order a well a the market share gain combined we the order pattern is beginning to align up a consistent way with the changing lead time and underlying growth through market growth a well a market share gain you and wish if you could a bit about inventory talked about you you built some inventory at distributor during the what’s the plan you’ve plan to add a bunch of capacity and in addition to guess you are also moving to a consignment model with some of those distributor you about a you build inventory is showing up in the revenue number or is mainly to consignment at this point believe we talked about resale of distribution were up about last and in addition we were able to build some inventory in the distribution channel would point out the turn in channel continue to be at a certain low level of about five turn overall the point of consignment inventory cost when it previously carried on the distribution book is now moving on to our book and constitute some growth you’ll begin to see in our held inventory at day I’d categorize continued to be very lean inventory balance overall we go we continue to convert more distributor inventory to a consignment arrangement and so we’ll shift from their book onto our book but be over the next and a half or so before we complete process Jeff a a correction distributor week of inventory are about five not turn you and let’s move to the next please our next come from of you very much focus a bit on the embedded where you’ve some strong growth you mentioned microcontrollers being the key driver color you can give u a to end market strength that’s driving strength in embedded and a a matter of explaining whether share gain or whether the overall industry some strength in embedded would be helpful you can try to give you some however you also have to keep in mind the area we growing more significantly in embedded processing were the catalog product so by definition those catalog product go into lot of different end market and it’s not any particular end market that’s driving it What would is in addition catalog grew strongest but we also saw growth in coms ph infrastructure and automotive a well but it catalog product were growing more significantly and when you about about application mirroring with one mentioned previously motor control you get equipment safety equipment medical equipment those type of application in Do we believe we are gaining share believe so and we haven’t the competitor’s report but with sequential growth in would venture to represents clearly market share gain from in area some of what you’ve for the last five year from in area where we have been growing well above market growth rate in embedded processing and the reality is we are of feeling the investment in area a well if anything over the course of we would expect to maintain relative out performance versus market overall if not even accelerate Do you have a follow on Urji do actually ask you about wireless so we we’re seeing early sign of the Nokia share ship to other supply into Nokia baseband chop into the revenue I’d to get a a to how much this contributes to your profit for the and also a we grow through the rest of the any a to how much of the baseband revenue is verse and should we see the modeling this down to zero by that’s my last take the latter part then make any comment he would choose about profitability there composition of baseband these day is of revenue is and then would leave basically representing the older technology By comparison in the of baseband revenue we’ve a very significant market shift over the course of the away from the older technology and towards and believe you commented would agree in term of competitor pressure at Nokia where again they’ve acknowledged and they have a strategy to multisource product this basically the competitor they have on board be addressing those older non technology which represent of our baseband technology and then the is to the best of our knowledge it be before they have any other alternative supplier on board with basebands there the regarding the contribution of baseband profitability to on there we’ve talked in the about the baseband product operating about a of profit margin and we’ve described in the last of quarter how we’ve removed much all of our RD spending on product line Request for support for customer service support low entry and thing of nature factory planning still go with given the nature basebands are largely to a single customer we don’t it’s appropriate for u to give any further commentary to profitability would be happening of particular product family for you question and we’ll move to the next next come from of good afternoon Regarding the Richardson fab could you give u a of what percentage of fab output potential could be in production by end assuming can end demand trend remain stable and when you would expect follow up Which fab are you referencing new a millimeter fab RFAB want to give an update on RFAB is still on schedule to harvest our production product exiting factory by the end of this announced of course phase one of the equipment claim to fab late last would give u an incremental of revenue capacity when fully up and running the last we announced phase two which give u a incremental total about of delta revenue capability when fully up and running Of course phase two be fully up after phase one so expect next or beyond the quick answer is by the end of this we expect to have qualified product shipping from factory able to begin to generate revenue do you have a follow up Also on the wireless revenue growth for would you expect seasonal or below seasonal output and or transquarter of a and do you the mix continue to increase that’s over it make mix continue stay on the trend it been whether hold for any particular is more precise than would want to get and then similar in term of our outlook we try to keep it at the a supposed to individual segment or product line don’t have a forecast for you on what we’ll expect from wireless there again in general we would expect to track overall the general performance of our customer in market you for your question and let’s move to the next you next come from of you of question given the lead time are now coming in what are you expecting for the turn this versus another few quarter don’t have a forecast for you on would note the term have been quick at five week for an extended of right now and so those thing tend to change at a fairly slow pace but beyond don’t have a forecast for you Is there a follow up on the wireless you one of the customer were a week late in the am wondering it to the baseband or it more broadbased across all the product line and also if you can address whether you expect to back this you in customer’s own preannouncement they described general weakness in their high end a you might expect go across more than basebands would be across apps processor and connectivity product in term of where we saw some unexpected weakness Now being the case if you at the sequential trend one you’ll note is basebands were down where the other area collectively still went up again but from what we were expecting with let’s early when we gave mid quarter guidance all those softened up somewhat because of particular customer for your and we’ll move to the next call next come from Ramesh with Advisors Ramesh Advisors afternoon and term of putting your growth number into historical prospective can you give u an idea of where historically growth been and where growth been Ramesh what would is if you at the last five year the average been at but also you of have to allow at least consider last year exceptionally robust with sequential growth If you move to the take out and move at the five year prior to it would have been percentage point le so again what we reported would generally right now of seasonal respect to again the fiveyear average is Last year similarly robust with sequential growth if you at the five year prior to and basically exclude the you would get to a growth number for Ramesh Advisors a quick one term of margin obviously very strong last presume mostly mix related where should we be thinking of margin of through the rest of the or any visibility there you can provide beyond talked in the about the portfolio should produce margin over averaging around and this is to be a change in our mix a we move over we did this most recent focus a we move out in now is on top line believe the portfolio is able to deliver the of margin we talked in the and the focus now is shifting to accelerating our top line growth and being more aggressive with our market share gain you very much and let’s move to the next please next come from of so much for taking the sorry if missed it but didnt hear where were lead time at the start of the of where are they where do you theyll be at the end of the lead time we didnt actually characterize the number on it why you didnt hear it They came down a bit again in a you saw in the we continue to make progress a we bring more capacity online and you could actually see the way were supporting is through destocking our fresh good inventory if you actually at our balance sheet youll see where most of our inventory build at we continue to bring capacity online notwithstanding variability and demand we’d expect lead to continue to down it coming down much across the board so is those item were greater than week we saw some of those coming down to le than Those were greater than we saw some of those down to le than and so on in each of those tranche a you take a at them would expect continued progress on front do have a follow on my followup be about maybe competitor lead time What are you hearing about what competitor lead time are doing a yours in a bit sort of anecdotal evidence were hearing is at least some of our competitor are actually experiencing extended lead time of course don’t order from them so we exactly what mean but we are hearing those kind of thing and were having customer coming to u and asking u we cant help out with some of those issue Their customer are also recognizing unlike our competitor we in fact had been aggressive in putting in capacity not only opening a simple test site to the bottom of the downturn last but starting RFAB late last and more recently the announcement we did last week of the acquisition of the Spansion Japan factory seems to be resonating well with our customer and in fact we believe this is helping u win additional order should accelerate our growth and accelerate our gain against those competitor from a future standpoint alone current lead issue some of them are starting to experience want to of reiterate some data we shared at the Meeting If you at capital spending between the and capital spending basically up over where when we at general the math of our competitor collectively they were down and believe this is an analogspecific comparison they were down on average and doesnt even comprehend the fact many of these competitor took a lot of capacity offline in addition not to spending on new capacity they were taking capacity offline Customers see data They see the spending were doing we did through plus what done in addition to and frankly they how they how to extrapolate into the future what situation is to result in in term of availability of product and why the situation Kevins describing is there Theyre already seeing some of these various competitor start to extend lead time while at the same they are seeing pulling lead time plus a lay the path for our future in term of these capacity investment frankly we big we it to be a big differentiator for over the course of the next few year you for your and we’ll move to the next call next come from the line of of much on topic you were talking about between the Spansion addition and then the Qimonda equipment you talked about adding of revenue capacity guess two question on can you tell u how much you paid for those Spansion asset then secondly the is about to time how much dollar growth over the last four year in your Are you getting more optimistic about how fast you can grow revenue or is this of a pull of CapEx should we about of big investment you’re making Ill go ahead and answer we started talking last a we were coming into the downturn and watching what on there we would remain poised to be opportunistic to go ahead and take advantage of acquisition of capacity a well a company if it made for the smaller company we can buy in because the price are so attractive is a continuation of what we talked about back then have been able to acquire these manufacturing asset at extremely attractive price the case of Qimonda we were able to discus what pricing the case of Spansion we have not disclosed can to you our estimate is the original acquisition cost of capacity we bought is close to and we spent it for a very attractive price one we are not at all concerned about cause u to have an undue of fixed cost to have to incur should the demand take a long to play out to go back to what a few moment with the underinvestment we’ve from a competitor standpoint we expect our growth rate in fact should be poised to accelerate versus our competitor and we may back on this a year from now and find this very inexpensive type capacity acquisition to be a very opportune move for u to make the much larger it safe to versus original acquisition price or cost what we paid a small fraction of is correct small fraction of the other would point out is when looking at of incremental capacity or revenue generation mean at our alone over so annualize and call it a last we were at and it still growing a we the strategy is to have capacity in place before we need it not trying to forecast exactly over what we fill it up but keep in mind were at a run rate in term of revenue Do you have a follow on it be a quicker one promise what did the calculator do in the thought you guided it to be up about well even more than entire other grew we had suggested Calculator typically up around to and it came in a bit stronger than but it within it normal pattern see in year we also described in the release there were some offset with lower royalty to higher revenue a well Calculators completely consistent with our expectation and maybe even a bit more for your question and we’ll move to the next next come from of a quick followup on the CapEx What percent equipped Richardson be after the Spansion asset are added we it be close to half the clean room have equipment in it so well have still half the clean room for future expansion thought on when the would be looking to build out then to be a function of when we continue to find the of opportunistic equipment acquisition in these last of quarter our interest there is to build in a very cost effective fashion and not to build it at any cost so youll continue to see u do what we have done and is when we see the right price for the right equipment we go ahead and pursue it and likely be in advance of when we actually need it you and we’ll move to the next please come from of of of hi or in term of the outlook for the the sale increase talking about outstripping the order growth which hasnt necessarily been how guided revenue in recent quarter wanted to get some more detail on the thought process around and is the backlog build stronger either the anticipation of later into and also further out into any color you could shed on me ask you a clarification saying our revenue outlook outstrips our order again our booktobill in you explain what you mean when you outstrip our order of meant growth rate the growth rate in revenue versus the growth in order witnessed in recent quarter would again what explained previously part of the reason booktobill coming down would be level would be more consistent with true end demand is what a lot of you have described for some although it happening in a more orderly fashion than what some of you would have projected a lead time have a we progressed in reducing lead time customer no longer need to provide u the very extended visibility they had done let six month when lead time were of out at their peak with lower visibility the new order are basically coming in to replenish at a is consistent with the true demand a opposed to the rate of order basically reflecting a backlog extending out over about the best can do in term of trying to explain Do you have a follow on of along those same line anything you could offer up in term of the momentum or the trajectory of order you saw through the and then initially here into and then whats the inventory outlook on your balance sheet into the don’t can sit there and describe a trajectory a we move through would order to date have strong and fully consistent with the outlook we provided in term of revenue term of our inventory expectation we do not at this point try to project any of inventory plan because our inventory plan for the have more to do with our outlook for the so we may give you more visibility a we move to the but at this point we typically don’t for your question we’ll move to the next next come from of wanted to open last you about your guidance is slightly above what would be considered normal seasonal you give u a a to what part of your you may be tracking ahead of plan or ahead of normal I’d it’s broad based do need to keep in mind our is typically the when customer order material in anticipation of holiday sale and even some order in anticipation of the Chinese New Year holiday sale so this seems to be shaping up consistent with other word we’ve a global economy that’s still growing albeit at a pace may be a bit down summarily the half versus the half still growing nonetheless and the order pattern we have reflects it’s broad based it’s been very strong and a we indicated earlier in the industrial and automotive segment talked about it and it’s gotten more to a normal seasonal of demand pattern in some of the other area such a computer and handset a a you guided depreciation to the same guidance you had before but thinking about you’ve now added some incremental capacity obviously through both Qimonda and Spansion acquisition and wondering if you were to phase one of RFAB and then basically do nothing else with the asset you’ve bought what would be the increment to depreciation we would expect to see in or don’t have a forecast for you out quite far but would of point you back to some of our spending over the last few year depreciation over the last month been a bit le than for the last month revenue CapEx if you include the most recent acquisition have been under about We’ve been talking about a CapEx target of between so I’d the spending is consistent with sort of of goal is you’ll see depreciation in the of over and looking with the CapEx we’re doing right now it’s to be still fine Of course that’s a function of what you wind up with revenue up to and but anticipation of the growth there which of course is what we’re expecting with the capital acquisition we’re making would expect to see depreciation of stay without actually getting into a dollar amount right now what we have guess disclosed up to now is for RFAB the phase one purchase of commodity equipment worth a over is correct Correct then we bought additional commodity equipment roughly if remember right plus some incremental equipment we didn’t disclose the amount of from Spansion and then you take those number make an estimate maybe for some incremental equipment from Spansion and our depreciation schedule for year get you roughly into our ball park and that’s not would be much before phase one or phase two of RFAB at least help then clarification on Spansion the fab is an operating fab currently and when we purchased it so in the additional depreciation associated with fab is already in our depreciation guidance which unchanged we provided Is correct Correct so obviously the incremental depreciation associated with milimeter Spansion fab is not very significant you for your question and we move to the next next come from of Capital Kyle Capital this is actually Kyle asking a on behalf your margin you were talking about over you were looking to get to you qualify qualify saying your shorter focus is to be top line revenue do you envision getting to the our shorter and longer focus is on revenue growth believe the model is well on it way there and at this point in rather than focusing on of model and discussion of our focus is on the top line because we believe with the portfolio we have it deliver the result talked about is how well maximize our earnings growth in the future by growing our top line Kyle Ill you mean we reported margin almost to a point where well be rounding so hold your breath Kyle Capital a quick one your WiLink product on the multimode radio product how is doing you add some color to please believe one would be for you to have to confess have very much knowledge on front Kyle sorry Kyle unfortunately either of u have a lot of insight into where were with product line unfortunately Although if it a product for handset which is where most of our WiFi focus is we have a very strong position mentioned before connectivity for is focused on both discrete GPS chip a well a Wireless LAN and Ill note industry analyst would estimate last we had about share of handset are smartphone WiFi market share again doesnt get to the product describing or asking about but we have a very strong position and you can rest assured were doing what we need to do in term of new product development to extend if not expand share the other would point out on is all of the connectivity option in a handset WiFi is the least penetrated but it also the most rapidly expanding we combination for our connectivity product and we have share in the connectivity technology is growing fastest in handset we great growth in term of revenue in term of product line and we expect more next come from of to clarify real quick the new CapEx guidance includes Spansion acquisition it Then on the margin can you walk u through what changed from to and comment on utilization rate trend and do you utilization rate be up flat or down for guess about three or four quarter we stopped discussion on utilization specifically we were discussing it when it illustrative of what on it dropping so fast and coming back up so sharply utilization level have fared back to a much more normal are somewhat elevated right now given the strong demand which is why were adding capacity utilization level didnt change much last to this and wouldnt expect them to change too much to next partly a a function of were bringing on additional capacity and so were of staying ahead of it now what else changed in driving margin margin yeah what we wind up with is mix a had in my opening comment not only the majority of our revenue delta in our core product area but the majority of our profit dollar came through and mix contributed along the GPM line a well a the operating profit line again to reinforce grew last Embedded Processing grew a those area continue to pace faster than our revenue overall well continue to benefit next come from of you talked about continuing to make progress on the lead time Do you those go back to normal level by the end of the cant give a precise answer on would to be able to yes but to be not only a function of the order mix come in but also a function of how fast the top line continues to grow mean I’d get it’d be fairly safe in saying we are growing at the upper end of our guidance it’s to be harder than it is if grow at the midpoint or at the lower end of our guidance but beyond couldnt give you a forecast then a my followup can you give u a of how much your capacity is to increase over the next six month and then also in the six month of next with the new fab coming on the biggest capacity increase are on two front over the next six month already discussed with the RFAB and is millimeter RFAB coming up and actually getting production material on by the end of the be at relatively low volume at a you can expect but it ramp up all through next then a to the Spansion fabs we get started quickly here on getting process adjusted in there so we can start wafer in those fabs by the end of the but expect to see them qualify for production until sometime in middle of next when we could start to actually generating revenue on product coming out of near over the next six month the capacity expansion is a combination of millimeter equipment redeployed and spanned out through various fabs a well a the assembly test equipment then a we move through half be primarily affected by RFAB increasing and then half would be a combination of further increase at RFAB a well a the millimeter Spansion fab would be in production by call it mid Correct next come from of Gleacher and Gleacher you have had a very successful acquisition strategy worked along the way and helped drive some of the market share gain seeing Is it possible for you to quantify for u what impact your acquisition have had on market share gain and how you are looking at acquisition actually cant comment on because the answer to sorry clearly important to u in most of these acquisition done are quite small and when we expose to the extent becomes product mix ph exposure to our sale force we find those very attractive because often time we can sell the product a fast enough to recover our purchase price and furnish our order but beyond to how much it’s actually increased our market share gain I’d be a bit hard to press articulate a number right now because the answer to Gleacher if could focus a bit on whats happening with all the cash did a nice job of buying back some stock this you u is there is any change in thinking between buyback and dividend and then also what your thought are on your hiring plan and if you could what is your outlook for your own internal budget heard three question in there but Ill give… Gleacher right the multiple choice you can pick your favorite Gleacher didnt answer the one on the cash a you observed we didnt pick up our buyback since last bought back of share in the and in the been doing by the way we have about of unexpended authorization remaining done over the few year to the extent stock buyback remain accretive be one way we use cash but it’s important to note the priority for our cash is to towards ph growth and be a been seeing u do either through acquisition of company a we acquired in about a few moment or opportunistic acquisition of capacity of course the way we use the cash is in the form of when the approves to deliver back to shareholder in dividend the hiring front have any comment on other than to a we bring on these factory already talked about in the Richardson fab several hundred people hired to staff fab a the equipment come online and we did mention in the acquisition announcement last week of the Spansion factory we would hire almost all of the people are there plus people wed hired there a to the budget something my CIO would to and Ill to him about when we do annual plan time for next well get back to you on one me ask you a on Spansion we have roughly people we may be have employee employed and we have output until sometime mid in term of product how do we mean are those cost to be a drag on profitability over the next guess is the expect to be providing continuing transition service Spansion is already supplying to a customer out of factory and we expect to continue to do while were bringing our own manufacturing process in there and to a large extent we would anticipate those transition service would largely offset our carrying cost of operation while were bringing up our process next come from Steve of hoping you could about the a bit here term of the high volume and logic would you is back to level you were at at the peak trying to understand whats driving the ish percent type growth there and how we should be thinking about growth Steve don’t off the top of my head don’t have the data on HVAL back to half ’ so don’t whether we’re how the comparison is a to how we moved back to peak level certainly we’ve moved very aggressively off of the off of would the last five quarter ’ when we saw revenue bottom and it’s grown very nicely since then and we would represents a turnaround of not call the cyclical bounce back in revenue but in fact a lot of the thing we had been talking about since believe it the ’ analyst meeting we had done to restructure and create efficiency in are in fact coming to fruition again that’s where we would declare it truly a a turnaround a opposed to a cyclical recovery and we do expect HVAL to continue what you’ve over the last which is to grow consistent with the other two business and contribute consistent with those with the overall revenue a opposed to the drag it had been previously Do you have a follow on Steve if you could how meaningful is the logic within highvolume sale growth back Is it the or is logical participating actually there and you don’t give too much detail on the breakout but is it meaningful what’s in HVA would describe it this way it’s a relatively small part of overall is commodity product and more in area so we have don’t want to it’s not meaningful certainly it’s meaningful although it’s a small part of HVAL and even of space you would have to there is a trend away from commoditization a they try to address more higher valued opportunity within there so it’s relatively small and getting smaller a a percent of the total from a logic perspective Steve you for your and operator we are to have for one additional and we’ll stop there our next come from of Capital Capital wondering if you guide up two to ten and bearing in mind you saw some weakness at the end of the in the wireless area Are you expecting to be broadly seasonal now having the softness at the end of last or how should we about characterized earlier if you take out last seasonally you might see grow to something in our forecast right now middle of our forecast is something right now so we’re in a round seasonal of growth and honestly it’s broad based it’s across all of our product line there’s no one area we’re looking a being different from what we’d normally expect versus any other area right now Capital with respect to the region wondering if either of you had any color on how you had the order pattern from Europe develop a you’d gone through the and if we begin to at the obviously one recognizes your capacity constraint have too much impact but can you give some color on what you’ve out of region don’t have data on the order pattern by region but do on revenue and what would to Europe is Europe grew much the same pace a our revenue did overall so if there’s weakness to it’s still ahead of u did not see it at all in the again Europe revenue grew at the same pace a revenue did overall last for your and overall you to wrap up you for joining u of this call is on our this today’s call you for your Have a wonderful day',\n",
       "       'you instruction we take our from with are you there why don’t we move to the next and we back to are we still online sir moment please please go ahead sir you hear me can hear you now right is on the margin why were the margin down despite the increase in sale can you maybe give u a of where margin can go for the rest of the you may recall in when we had our earnings release and our call mentioned we were reinstating compensation change compensation increase for everybody in and we also based upon our higher outlook we see related compensation such a profit sharing up so what you are seeing is the effect of through the margin line fact if you adjust for the fallthrough would be very closely better than expected it Do you have a followon If you could about where you can expect margin to trend for the rest of the ie can they go up much or the compensation continue to impact we’ve established a margin target of margin and operating margin we remain very confident being able to achieve those main driver of of course is to be the revenue mix a we go mentioned already and Embedded Processing and the core Wireless Products are now about of our total revenue become a richer mix in most and a very nice margin would expect mix to continue to richen up a we go through the and the year follow and the margin move up accordingly Beyond won’t give a a to when we we be achieving could you speak a minute on the compensation how much of what we saw from to with of a onetime moving into the New Year versus what we expected quartertoquarter that’s a good point compensation change you saw in the our annual raise are actually effective from we saw twothirds of the effect of in the we’ll see a bit more of into where the total rate burden the on our outlook our accrual we take for other compensation for other compensationrelated incentive type thing such a profit sharing to be adjusted a well you let’s move to the next please we go next to with good afternoon Sounds your utilization rate went up in which maybe above the flattish expectation you had last also if you could about your expectation in relative to your capacity ramp our utilization rate didn’t move much very consistent what we about While we do expect utilization go up a bit next it’s to be much again have you may have noticed from our balance sheet we are able to build some inventory in the even with our utilization not changing by much help position u well for growth into the so we have a small relatively small additional wafer start we be able to reach those type of revenue number we gave in the guidance we don’t have expectation we are sharing on our utilization a tie more to our expectation Do have a followon Also given your expectation to face up the baseband are you changing your pricing strategy there or is it much in line with what you’ve done in the and perhaps also some pricing comment on the side of the don’t have comment on baseband pricing Again most of our pricing there tends to be driven more by longerterm contract but since most of our baseband revenue go to a single customer it would be inappropriate for u to about pricing trend respect to no abnormal change there the pricing in general especially in the high performance area tends to be very stable in area HVAL where it may tend to trend down over it tends to trend down based upon longerterm pricing agreement and those are well understood trend we engineer for If can broaden the only area where we have pricing move more with the nearterm market environment would be on the commodity area we’ve set pricing last so pricing trended up in fact we saw a well in the you let’s move to the next please go next to with check your mute function go next to with you very much you hear me we can one quick mean when you at your revenue growth in the last three or four quarter which have been fairly strong and we try to consolidate with the ultimate end market be it industrial be it wireless Are you concerned at all inventory might be inaudible down the line with the OEMs mean it seems to be evidently you of categorize this yourself and try to figure out why this is happening because seems to be bit of a with the stress ph we have with the component growth a of the end market themselves guess the advice would have in doing comparison is you can’t have the starting point be in the last three or four quarter because in the half of last especially of last and even starting at ’ a the downturn started to take force we were significantly undershipping our customer a they were reducing inventory to at growth trend coming off of bottom when we were undershipping customer is not an appropriate metric do believe of all let’s about the customer inventory heard u of all with respect to distribution our channel inventory were able to get some inventory built there but week of inventory maintained at about five which is by any historical metric point to be lean have an additional significant percentage of our OEM customer where we are managing their component inventory because it’s that’s done on a consignment we it’s lean and it tends to be very productive fabturning inventory if you put distribution and the OEM consignment program together represents about twothirds of TI’s revenue base leaf about onethird of the customer we have frankly le direct visibility into their inventory all sign and indication we pick up is inventory remain lean this is a general supply chain type of consideration inventory are lean customer are trying to build inventory and bring in product consistent with our end demand they are not to a point where they have been able to significantly increase inventory from the day or week certainly we watch it we watch relative growth we to customer about their need and all of we haven’t anything to this point is setting off any of alarm fact if anything we are still the other way around where we are trying to continue to pull up our supply to be able to fully meet the customer’s demand with the service level they are used to from do you have a followon do actually for the answer followon is if at the other revenue seems to be a very meaningful contributor to margin mean one of the key contributor there of course is the royalty you give u any comment a to what’s driving royalty at the moment What if you don’t give u the actual size of number but to get a of what’s driving royalty right now you started to deal with DRAM company and what the acquisition are also within DLP if you can also about what the acquisition are within That’s my last you on the royalty front naturally that’s a function of how well our licensee are doing in general we’ve a strong market on quantify any of the unit underneath the Other other than to what’s up and what’s down Royalties up DLP also up quite a bit also happens to be a very attractive margin that’s on the strength of projector fact not only quarteroverquarter but also yearoveryear if recall believe it doubled on a yearoveryear we are seeing continued strong demand especially for the DLP into the future Again not being on area because we don’t forecast forecast below the Overall what we see next so it’s not lost on folk a we calculate our it’s the Other you may recall a seasonally stronger and that’s when the backtoschool selling season happens so we typically see an uptick from to for and we are expecting about to both and in term of revenue there typically go up a bit in the and then drop off again in the due to the seasonal nature of you very much me make a comment also on what’s driving DLP strength because certain part of it is the yearago effect of market being weak in inventory actually of DLP education is a very big market driver for our front projector product we are seeing a lot of strength now especially for example in Asia a school and classroom over there start deploying DLP projector and the classroom similar to what may a difficult had done DLP a very significant reliability advantage make it attractive to educational system other is more recently starting to play out is a differentiator for our DLP front projector is they are capable so you certainly about and the cinema but actually educational system are using a capability to help student better visualize thing wouldn’t normally pop out in tech book or in diagram then certainly you don’t have to very far to realize how big is with movie cinema these day what would is almost all of is being done on TIbased DLP projector you for your question and we’ll move to the next go next to with you you hear me sir yes wondering you five week wasn’t still lean What is historically in term of your leadtimes when do you they be to a more normal historical distribution one in the eight to nine week and that’s over the few year maybe excluding last if we go back longer if we go back further in history they would have even carried more week of inventory Certainly part of the reason inventory level have down are structure thing we’ve done from a consignment program a a refresher we actually started guess it in of pulling consignment program to distribution about of our distribution revenue is supported by consignment structurally tend to bring down inventory level even accounting for inventory level distributor remain lean do you would you to answer the leadtimes mentioned during the midquarter earnings call we have already begun to pull in leadtimes a we’ve been bringing on capacity to deal with the high level of demand we’ve had we have further program a we came out of the still have a number of product have been of longer than we prefer at this point we bring significant progress coming to the me we are to continue installing additional capacity for each of the quarter of and we expect should greatly enable our ability to bring new account back to the normal Do you have a followon please wondering if you could provide u some color on how your order book looking into what area do you expect strength from and what area do you expect the least growth we don’t break our guidance down into particular market need to stay away from me thus far in the which is what day order are strong and fully consistent with the guidance we provided to you you we’ll move to the next go next to with Partners Partners of all back to the leadtime topic can you put some parameter or number around where leadtimes have been and where they are now are talking about ten of thousand of part number series is no one answer but leadtimes were in excess of week total back in to the eight to week of Leadtimes were in excess of and pulling back into the of it of seems across the board where unfortunately more and more of our product are moving back into a normal leadtime for particular product not all the saying depends on the manufacturing process Some process would take longer naturally than other process the leadtimes are all beginning to move back in consistent with those process a there is still some work to do on should be dealt with a new capacity continues to online this way of thinking about it guess at midquarter we were seeing data allowed u to believe they had stabilized described a we were making slight improvement in leadtimes Since then we’ve a lot of progress would describe compared to slight improvement at midquarter would describe the improvement a significant at this point they have turned They have turned very clearly in the right direction and we are making significant progress Do you have a followon Partners one the HVAL base grown four consecutive quarter and fully recovered you a bit about some of the bigger end market have been responsible for recovery please only would is don’t what would if fully recovered we certainly believe we have it well on a path and we the turnaround we had talked about for a of year now is well underway there are still there is still work to do is still additional progress to be made in term of further diversification of those product in the market we are working through if you at HVAL isn’t a single market a variety market even to clearly computing and peripheral we participate in with those product would include area printer but maybe more significantly would be hard disk drive Those were some example Probably automotive would be another one would mention a a notable area of improvement you we’ll move to next please we’ll go next to with back Sorry for the snap though had a followup on the leadtimes with the leadtimes coming in on the back end mostly can you a bit about cancellation you’ve maybe on a relative in and then comparing to and then what you’ve so far in this can answer quickly We’ve no change in leadtimes is no abnormal cancellation Pardon me change in cancellation have no more adjustment there at all fact would observe it during the even though we were improving the leadtimes on a considerable but again we did see inaudible order in the talked about earlier booktobill inaudible showing customer continue to have significant demand for our product to be honest there there been a lot of investor and analyst concern and worry about what happen when leadtimes pour in and what how might affect order beyond of focus is missing the force for the three this type of very strong demand environment there any noise in the order line associated with our changing leadtimes could have been but it more than plump by rising in demand rising production from our customer again would caution against getting to microfocused on detail and focus more on the recovering economy and what that’s driving in term of demand for semiconductor do you have a followon me follow up of on a longer on margin in this you mentioned you’re layering on some comp and some CapEx if you move throughout this and into next how you’re thinking about the margin and where we should be thinking about where can trend to we’ve been talking for a year now about margin working their way a we rebuild the portfolio to a of structure that’s not to the ceiling of our floor to our portfolio should be able to deliver on a fairly reliable Going we continue to be even more confident we be in those of margin especially a we see and embedded processing becoming a bigger mix of our revenue overall the CapEx front we’ve talked for a while about CapEx running in the to of percent of revenue in fact we are consistent with looking over some data this morning and our capital spending for the last month been almost exactly of revenue which bodes well for depreciation a we move also we should see depreciation throughout on the margin addition to we’ve been acquiring capital at extremely attractive price we are getting more capacity than we would normally get dollarfordollar of capital spend which bodes very well for being able to grow our top line which is where we are highly focused the is driving top line growth at this point a opposed to trying to adjust the margin model you let’s move to the next please go next to with so much for taking the appreciate it If we the millimeter fab getting ramped up how quickly do you realistically you could gain some of meaningful share coming out of fab the schedule right now is for them to be shipping it production worth product by the end of this a mentioned we started Phase II expansion in factory Phase to give u of incremental revenue capacity That’s what we announced a quarter Phase two is a of revenue capacity and we have begun bringing equipment purchased equipment last week to support and we be bringing in very quickly would expect to have some fairly meaningful revenue begin to out of there in phase offer right do you have a followon stay on do we the phase would be complete understand you ship product in the but when would phase one be of fully ramped that’s to be a functional demand guess would to forecast all the way out to the end of a to when each of those piece of machine would be fully utilized but they certainly be ready to be fully utilized a we out of this and go into next sometime early in then Generally and we wait for the order better you you go to the next we go next to with you a of question on account receivable it went up a bit in the the tightness would have expected it to remain flat or actually down a bit If you can give u a bit more color to what’s on there the what typically happens on our shipment in the are actually a drop off a fair amount in a customer put their factory on holiday and so on so our receivables tend to decline and our day of receivables tend to go down Coming out of into we are back into a more normal manufacturing environment with our customer more uniform factory loading and full hour shipment are more uniform across the which in turn by contrast to of receivables level up when your revenue grows and you wind up your day up a well If you on a yearoveryear actually very consistent on these base relative linearity between and shipment Right do you have a followon the pricing front you mentioned you are seeing some beneficial pricing on the commodity side Now the lead time are coming in do we expect any change to pricing mean do you expect the price to of revert to the normal decline if so what of impact should we have to expect on the margin you don’t want to try to forecast what commodity pricing might be is an area where sometime since it’s the beginning of the we have actually been on a what we call controlled order entry process where customer could not in and place unlimited demand on u based upon a certain leadtime provide certain level of support to customer have been historic customer if competitor were having issue supplying product we weren’t to be the benefactor for all of their customer to be able to gain support commodity been of a different environment for the last few quarter very difficult for this part with this of market environment in term of how we and how our competitor move to a controlled order entry process the statement about leadtime reduction and such have not yet applied to those commodity product more statement about general product in a better processing high performance power HVAL those type of product area for your question we’ll move to the next go next to with Banc of AmericaMerrill Banc of SecuritiesMerrill hi you talked about OpEx up and some impact to your cost line from higher compensation on operating margin wise it seems trend may have impacted all of your segment but your Other segment wondering what is special there Was it royalty saw a bit uptick relative to everything else in the the Other actually doesn’t have none of the staffing you see in the three primary segment so there is not much compensation to run through there compared to the other one then again we have very high margin of cash cow item if you are in so dollarfordollar they tend to fall through quite rich but it’s to down to you don’t have a much compensation that’s to see the change we saw in the Other Do you have a followon to Banc of SecuritiesMerrill do have one you refrained from commenting specifically on your baseband into the overall in term of the do you expect the trend to be largely seasonal better growth in offset by maybe some erosion in your hedge should we about it big picture if can even move beyond this you’ve heard u for some and we’ll it again we expect our baseband revenue to be essentially zero by the end of if you take our baseband revenue of and trade line to zero at the end of what you are to find is there likely be quarter above this line and quarter below the line exact profile of the decline is to depend upon our customers’ success in the market and the mix of their versus older technology a well a our customer sorry our competitors’ progress in delivering baseband product to meet the customers’ need maybe some additional color can help you to your own analysis on this is if you consider baseband represent about of our baseband revenue that’s up from about a a the market transitioned to these more advanced technology it’s well known our largest customer is intending to multisource their baseband what you can expect in is competitor should begin to support the older technology represented of our baseband revenue in the for we don’t anticipate competitor to begin ramping new product there until sometime in our revenue profile this in is to depend on how the competitive incursion compare against the ongoing market shift to and also how our customer performs in market hopefully provides you some of insight for your question we move to the next please go next to Steve with Steve not if missed it but could you if you’ve already discussed the mix of high performance in power versus HVAL within didn’t specifically break out Steve nor do we the only we of do more on an annual Think about last it a mix of HPA power and the remaining within the HVAL we don’t provide quarterbyquarter update there Do you have a followon Steve Steve you at least give some color within HPA what may be driving assuming that’s up since we are rolling on up What product type are generally driving Is it amplifier is it converter et cetera on a percentage give u color on what’s wrong with product standpoint you named several of them there operational amplifier data converter and then also in the industrial interface product or the area grew fast our high performance price similar to lot of the other HPA player you’ve out there a strong exposure to the industrial market and is benefiting a the industrial market continues to have a robust recovery here those product area mentioned but didn’t offer maybe more aligned with industrial market overall Steve for your question we move to the next go next to with a clarification in your baseband and last Did you mean last a in the of last or the entirety of last of and migrated to Do you have a of an average of what it for the full but get to somewhere between those two number Sorry don’t have data in front of me That’s a good guess followon shifting gear to the order book the duration of those order can be three or sixmonth order depending upon the type of customer Has your leadtime being pulled in started to be visible in the duration of order people are placing threemonth versus sixmonth would suggest with a booktobill and a growth rate we are suggesting consume all those order next can assume we are still seeing some order in the north of three month of window Nothing north of six month don’t recognize order far out a good portion of those in the three to sixmonth don’t have the exact breakout but would be my expectation you you we’ll move to the next go next to with following up on last when you are getting order now are you through a process of scrubbing those for anything you may be of questionable order and if your process any different now than may it been in the this is real simple process is the same a it been for the last few quarter now so we are looking very closely at each order coming in and making we are meeting true demand what the customer need to keep their line up for then my followup is on capacity growth Are you able to quantify how much capacity you are bringing on maybe in inch equivalent let’s by the end of this calendar then can you compare point to where you were at the end of ie are you above your ‘ amount of capacity or below don’t have those number Certainly we talked about on the millimeter the incremental revenue give u we have talked about purchasing and deploying millimeter equipment last and more this but frankly don’t have the number for you to give you any further answer on are clearly adding capacity you saw believe it in the release every of this of the starting point is production now for the is higher than it’s ever been and our capacity increase every a we move through to clarify there some capacity decline from your peak capacity level in ’ we did not take any factory offline other factory we’ve taken offline in the last of year been KFAB we’ve redeployed back in early ’ then there an older factory we had acquired with the BurrBrown acquisition in Tucson we also ran down in the early ’ frame during the downturn we took no capacity offline fact we’ve added in the capacity right you please go to with good afternoon for taking my guess if you hit the high end of your guidance you start to see revenue you saw make in sort of the ’ margin are actually to be down a bit from ’ guess given the mix moved dramatically more towards trying to figure out how we should about don’t have the data in front of me from back there not quite how you are modeling the margin assumption would you the OpEx be up a bit though again next a mentioned earlier on our full quarter’s overall compensation change don’t how you are squeezing through your model but you should take note of beyond don’t have the data in front of me for frame in can’t respond to you well on Do you have a followon followup a we about millimeter coming online how do we model from a margin perspective Is it incremental depreciation or you go through a quarter of of suboptimal yield if we need to of work into the model a we are ramping about even a we speak we are ramping up now are experiencing a cost there because everything we are doing there is not inventory inaudible being expensed way to about the economics on is generally speaking the die cost would be about le than what the equivalent die would be on a millimeter wafer LL part about of your cost is in die and is in the assembly or test you get about of manufacturing cost reduction in the applestoapples comparison to inch That’s at the product so a we at turning into revenue coming out of factor you can of model those number out and figure out the incremental margin we get out of factory for your you we’ll move to the next please go next to with Broadpoint Broadpoint for taking my you offered some great detail on the rampdown on the Wireless in the baseband side you actually more about what’s happening on the you are keeping the apps processor and the connectivity and what you expectation are for throughout the and into next don’t have a forecast for you but me it’s tied to a smartphone market where we believe you have smartphones growing on the order of unit growth this compared to last being in a rapidly growing market is always a good then secondly a thoughtful expectation over the course of we want to continue taking market share there across all the application processor a well a the connectivity product it’s a combination strategy a you might guess is very attractive market in term of growth which is why we’ve centered up our wireless investment in space and then also playing from the strength of our position and our technology with the OMAP application processor then a lot of connectivity right now is a lot of integration of multiple connectivity technology into pure chip both for power consumption and cost we are absolutely leading integration nearterm on OMAP the growth driver be the deployment of OMAP which is our latest production part and soon to be followed up with OMAP a you might guess we’ve a good pipeline of technology and we have a great pipeline of design win OMAP be ramping more than design win over the course of the next over the next into production and we point to a very attractive growth opportunity Do you have a followon Broadpoint That’s great color you for you on the OpEx side you keep mentioning your target model and for the operating margin would imply OpEx spending are actually running under Are we to get ourselves in trouble here thinking it’s based at the present percentage or should we be modeling percentage to back up Then followon to is what is your present plan for use of cash and your fab ratio on the OpEx we are mindful of computing OpEx percent with baseband removed it’s to be to zero at some point so when you do we’re actually at about we continue to be very disciplined in how we manage the OpEx for the foreseeable future to the use of cash you’ve u over the last few year using cash flow inaudible and dividend increase can’t make any forecast on those on dividend increase of course because they are subject to approval a we continue to generate cash we try to deploy it internally for growth and to the extent we’ve deployed a much a we can effectively growth with then we continue to do buyback and also continue to pay dividend to our shareholder don’t have a payout ratio for you tried to model in or inaudible communicate right now we’ll move to the next please go next to with for taking my one on the operating margin by unit core is the nonOther stuff they all compressed Embedded compressed quite a bit differently than the others down about point versus about to point for and Wireless you give me some feeling for were the compensation increase and OpEx increase by unit about the same what imply for the margin of those individual business and the change in those margin out of this the biggest is we’ve to of carefully at u is we are still redeploying internally mentioned in his remark about of our total RD is now towards three growth area the Embedded Processing and the nonbaseband portion of Wireless transition been underway for very aggressively during but even started earlier than what you’re seeing on a quarteroverquarter is a bit more to redeploy it Again some of is coming out of the Other into Embedding Processing and so on We’ve also stepped up our staffing there quite a bit in the sale you accelerate the opportunity we see especially in the microcontroller space with the bit opportunity we see emerging on side you had a lot of employee listening very carefully to how you are to answer do you have a followon Got it do Around the phase two for the millimeter can you give me a feeling for you bought tool Is how complete is the purchase for phase two you give me a feeling for guess the degree of discount you are getting for this equipment versus what you paid for phase one phase one what for the full wafer per Phase one actually support part of phase two also by the way of the thing phase two is good is on line balancing for u we spend about on those on those tool we mentioned earlier we be needing to acquire some more tool to complete phase two Overall spending be below what we spent on phase one but that’s because of your line balancing what mean by is some of the phase one equipment can support more than incremental of revenue we’ve been talking about support into the number without some of the line balancing equipment phase two start bringing and you can’t get of fruit that’s what you are seeing happening here our cost for equipment so far in phase two been quite similar to what we saw in phase one Got it you you what you the phase two put it this way equipment purchase requirement for our dollar of revenue at our fab should be le than what required for phase one which the dollar Is correct Right right operator we’re to move to our final questioner here we go to with inaudible didn’t of you inaudible go ahead you were successful in building a bit of inventory in the the are you thinking you are likely or planning to build some more inventory in the coming a now made some progress in reducing the leadtimes do you get the your leadtimes based on what you see now are likely with the plan you have in place to be at the normalized level by the end of the do you could happen somewhat earlier on the inventory buildout if you at into forecast on the inventory itself would point out though a mentioned earlier to one of the other question at a booktobill our order are stronger than our outlook which mean we are getting order are out into the so in the we begin to build not only the delivery but also delivery to the extent the revenue continues to grow of course we have to build more inventory to support you would see some growth if in fact we expect revenue to increase in the it’s too early for me to give you a forecast on a to the leadtimes reach a normal our customer would love if could right now but the truth of the matter is we do plan on continuing to put equipment in place for each of the quarter of it’s to be a function of how strong demand continues to be If it keep on coming in at the upper end of our forecast range it take u longer to get leadtime cleared up If it come in around the midpoint or lower we’ll clean it up sooner clearly it is in our interest to try to get it cleaned up a quickly a possible and I’d to the number followup if may is given what and you had a stronger than expected beginning of the in the then seasonal traditionally and maybe seasonalish in the do you feel now entering an environment likely to play out after the half of the largely according to seasonal norm given what you see do you feel given the strength of the beginning of the you might expect it to be somewhat more moderate than the norm obviously in recent speech been talking about how it unusual to see a booktobill of more than one for five quarter this is the fifth on the other hand it seems saying quite good order strength through the beginning of this Do you have any further thought you might be able to sort of share or frame with u in term of expectation on how booktobill might begin to trend you Look can give you a short answer and don’t the answer to would what we are seeing here is the result of economy are generally growing again and the consumer are beginning to spend again are seeing it in the automotive space are seeing the consumer space are seeing the industrial coming back inventory remain very lean a we’ve been talking about it doesn’t appear to u they are likely to become cleared up if you in the half would suggest we continue to see some interesting growth a to exactly what size don’t how to forecast for you right now one would add is there been a whole lot normal about this downturn and the subsequent recovery we’ve gone through mean the last month been highly unusual wouldn’t try to force it into any of normal pattern matching then the other comment would make is if you at our outlook of the middle of the outlook is seasonal for in term of the we don’t have an outlook we are issuing for half but at least the next we can affirm our belief it should be seasonal at least in the middle of you for all of you you for joining u of this call is on our concludes today’s you for your'],\n",
